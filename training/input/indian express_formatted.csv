ARIES, Your week falls neatly into distinct phases. The completion of routine tasks is your number one priority until Tuesday and, after Wednesday, you'll deal with all those emotional wobbles. But if someone does seem intent on causing a fuss, why not just ignore them? It would be best if you concentrated on your own affairs.
TAURUS, You're coming to the end of an emotional period, when you've been too ready to sacrifice your interests to those of other people. Your desire to serve others is admirable, but not if it means that partners walk all over you! Your horoscope continues to show an unusual concentration on money and, by all accounts, your business sense is booming. 
GEMINI, Passions are still running high, and the degree of emotional intensity circulating in the cosmos remains pretty awe-inspiring. To avoid trouble, you must be impeccably polite and considerate. At work, it is now time to learn a new skill, perhaps by taking a short course. It doesn't have to be a big deal. 
CANCER, First things first - don't rush it! There is still a great deal going on behind the scenes, away from prying eyes, and you have to be happy with your plans before you go public. After all, you don't want to risk unnecessary criticism, do you? In love, you're still chasing a fairy-tale fantasy but please keep one foot in the real world. 
LEO, The greatest pressures are coming from all directions at once, and midweek - perhaps from Tuesday to Thursday - you'll probably decide that you've had enough. If you feel like ducking out and disappearing for a few days, go right ahead! Do be sure to keep family members informed of what you're doing, though. That's only fair. 
VIRGO, Get up with the lark and go to bed with the owl for, while upbeat, energetic Mars is charging through your chart, you will cram as much in to every week as you can. The one golden rule is to pace yourself, eat well and keep fit. A financial deal could finally yield a profit around Thursday or Friday. And, if you have a chance for a rest, take it. 
LIBRA, The Sun's marvellous motions mean that it's time for all born under the sign of the Balance to celebrate their blessings and put their burdens into perspective. However, the really good news is provided by Mercury and Venus, two splendid planets which encourage you to take confidence-building measures. Plus, be sure to settle all those issues which are troubling you. 
SCORPIO, You have many talents, but you often give out misleading signals. Some people regard your tendency to secrecy as a bad characteristic. How wrong they are! Your ability to respect confidences and reward the trust placed in you is a fine quality which will come in very handy over the next two or three weeks. 
SAGITTARIUS, Many of you are still inclined to blow your tops, but you must remember that people you think are guilty are in fact completely innocent! Passions should be running high, but you may direct your energy towards positive, constructive and cultural ways of enjoying yourself. An old friend may have the best advice, so listen well  and take heed. 
CAPRICORN, You're on a positive path  that's for sure. This is still a relatively busy phase, and by no means dull  if not wildly exciting. If you're alive to new possibilities you'll find all sorts of ways to bring a little inspiration to work and routine chores. Ambitious Capricorns are now moving into top gear - and about time too! 
AQUARIUS, You can now look ahead and make plans for the coming months. Right now, some people are unwilling to accept flattery or generous gestures. I hope you're not among them because, over the period ahead, a number of partners, friends and colleagues will be more than willing to offer you praise, affection and presents. 
ARIES, You may have a sense of being in limbo, or cast adrift. Quite why this should be so is not clear, but we can say that you'll have your feet back on firm ground very soon. This is a time to be constructive in outlook and resolute and firm in your approach. 
TAURUS, Stress levels are set to ease up. A battle royal has been taking place between a number of other planets, an encounter with profound consequences for your emotional security. It may be that you have already decided that things cannot go on as before. But then, you have known that for a long while. Come to think of it, it's time for an improvement! 
GEMINI, If you have been in touch with underlying trends, you will know that this has been a time of unique and reassuring experiences. But you must still be aware that there are serious emotional questions to be dealt with. It's just that it's difficult to get to the real issues. 
CANCER, Many of you will be feeling the uncompromising impact of Mars blowing through your life. It must be clear by now that the pattern of your affairs and activities must be changed for the better. And I have a feeling you'll make a start by putting up some extra cash. 
LEO, Perhaps you now feel like battening down the hatches and taking shelter from emotional assaults. You may feel unfairly squeezed between people who think you should become more deeply involved and those who wish you to withdraw altogether. Watch out for financial confrontations - they can be avoided, you know. 
VIRGO, Seven planets encouraging you to do your own thing and go your own way is not bad support. You are under no pressure to take certain adventurous and even extraordinary steps, but the opportunity is there if you wish to use it. It really is up to you. 
LIBRA, It is your own sweet nature which enables you to keep your emotions and temper under control. You must continue to exercise charm, tact and diplomacy even if you fear that you have suffered in a business matter. It's time to forgive and forget. 
SCORPIO, Accept the fact that partners have their own beliefs, ideas and feelings. You may have cause to take up the gauntlet and rise to the challenge, yet it may be best to let matters rest and go your own way. Partners are likely to be over-fussy, but that's all down to the current awkward lunar alignments. 
SAGITTARIUS, Realise that a joint financial arrangement or business association may have to end if you are to achieve a number of goals or ambitions. On the other hand, you must forge a new relationship without delay. Only then will you know that you have the support to proceed. 
CAPRICORN, The next few days lift your heart and raise your hopes. When dealing with affairs of the heart you must take into account the fact that partners are now developing much stronger ideas as to who does what and when. It may be tactful to give way, at least in the short-term. 
AQUARIUS, You may still need to spend some time away from home or outside your usual environment if you are to be certain of your next move. On the other hand, domestic responsibilities are likely to deny you the chance to get away. But, first, figure out exactly how much your plans will cost. 
ARIES, You know full well that it is within your power to determine the outcome of financial negotiations and discussions. There's something that's still not entirely clear, though. Perhaps the role of a female associate has yet to be established - you don't quite know where you stand. 
TAURUS, Current astrological trends offer you a marvellous opportunity to face up to awkward or highly emotional situations. Acknowledge partners' complaints and criticism in the knowledge that you have got what it takes to put them right. You must believe in yourself. 
GEMINI, You are now entering a phase in which you may reasonably allow situations to take their own course. However, as far as specifically financial affairs are concerned, you must be careful not to let events run out of your control, especially at this delicate stage. 
CANCER, You're still on top of events, but your best bet at the moment is to occupy your time in such a manner that you cannot be forced to accept unsatisfactory conditions. Keep a close watch on financial affairs later in the day, and make sure that nobody pulls the wool over your eyes. 
LEO, This is likely to be a crucial period as far as both career and domestic hopes are concerned. Family pressures which have surfaced recently may go back a long way. Now you have the opportunity to tackle these entrenched, long-term issues and deal with partners who have dug their heels in. 
VIRGO, The current Pluto alignment indicates that an emotional or family tie is quite clearly giving you some cause for concern just now. However, a solution lies well within your grasp and it is therefore in your interests to be placatory; it's easy when you know how! 
LIBRA, In a matter of days a number of pieces of the jigsaw will fit into place. Yet first you may have to endure a certain amount of aggravation from partners who still do not believe you are up to the job. It is true, though, that you may have to smarten up your act. 
SCORPIO, Mercury's relationship with your sign suggests that you have probably become accustomed to harsh words and heavy demands, especially when discussing personal questions. All the relevant issues must now be brought to the surface. And sooner rather than later. 
SAGITTARIUS, There really seems to be little point in arguing or apportioning blame over a career matter. You must see that there is much good sense in what other people have to say, and you will reject good advice at your peril. It's time to listen, and to bide your time. 
CAPRICORN, Partners and close associates have really been remarkably willing to compromise when you think about it. You have only a short time left to reach a firm agreement before you again run into stiff opposition. Oh, and keep an eye on legal irritations. 
AQUARIUS, Recent statements have undoubtedly been an eye-opener, and you now have the perfect opportunity to pull a number of different emotional strands together. Close friends will appreciate your new, fresh approach. It makes a change from partners complaining that you are upsetting their plans! 
ARIES, Don't anticipate the outcome of any meetings, no matter whether you're sitting down with partners or colleagues. Although you may no longer be in charge, discussions which are outside your control will be to your advantage, so allow events to take their course. 
TAURUS, Astrology has a great deal to do with timing, with both the right time and the wrong time to initiate various ventures. Now is an excellent moment for you to get a number of enterprises under way as long as you are absolutely clear about your motives and goals. 
GEMINI, For a few weeks, a show of independence has been bolstered by the vigorous presence of the planet Mars. Now you will be challenged to stand on your own two feet, even to offer a helping hand to someone who has supported you in the past and who really does now need your help. 
CANCER, You are willing to believe that others are ready and able to offer you the emotional support that you need. You may now think about spreading your wings and branching out into a different sphere of activity. The planets suggest new business activities. Are you interested? Are you ready? 
LEO, The current delicate relationship between Venus and Pluto indicates that you would be wise to avoid any conflicts or confrontations with family members, especially brothers and sisters. Others may be beginning to sense that all is not to your liking on the home front, but I doubt if they're ready to compromise. 
VIRGO, You may still feel rather out on a limb, perhaps because someone has passed you by or belittled your talents. Yet support from the helpful planet Mercury indicates that there is little that can disturb your equilibrium - as long as you're prepared for the unexpected! 
LIBRA, A financial or business crisis is but the tip of the iceberg and the symptom of a much deeper malaise. What is at issue is your refusal to value your gifts and the contribution you are able to make to society at large. If you're in a quandary, take stock, seek advice and start afresh. 
SCORPIO, This is a time to stand up for yourself and let others see just how strong-willed and self-sufficient you really are. Yet if partners seem hell-bent on a collision course, please do your best to avert a clash. There is so much you can do to defuse tension behind the scenes. 
SAGITTARIUS, In view of an impending planetary opposition you must not enter into new financial arrangements without taking expert or legal advice. Yet with a sound and well-thought-out approach you may do much better than expected. In fact, I think you're about to hit the jackpot. 
CAPRICORN, You will probably have little difficulty convincing close companions that certain alterations will be to everyone's advantage. After all this time some degree of success is unavoidable, if only because there is certain inevitability about your current path. 
AQUARIUS, Having experienced just how thoughtless and intransigent certain people can be, you must now find new ways to shift the ground in your favour. However, there is little to be gained from forcing the issues, so I suggest you continue on a generous, tolerant and flexible, ready-for-anything path. 
ARIES, Someone still appears to imagine that you will give way over a financial matter, yet colleagues may yet have the ground swept from under them. However, you must move forward in concert with your sympathisers. If you break ranks now you'll expose all your weaknesses. 
TAURUS, Mercury is still on your side, and news received during the coming week should both gladden your heart and make it clear that your instincts and intuitions have been right all along. The point is that you seem to have all the best ideas, but you still have to persuade other people of that fact! 
GEMINI, There is so much going on behind the scenes at work that it is difficult or even impossible to gauge the outcome of current developments. Put personal qualms to one side, press ahead with confidence and put the priority on completing unfinished emotional business. 
CANCER, Mars is preparing to take a more active role in your life and you will very soon have an undisputed opportunity to make your position clear. You must be ready to speak and act in no uncertain terms. After all, I know you're sensitive, but you're also quite capable of being as tough as anyone else when necessary. 
LEO, Three planets, glistening away in the angles of your chart responsible for your career and professional hopes, leave you in no doubt that this is the time to push yourself forward. Pull every string possible to ensure that you are taken much more seriously. 
VIRGO, Aside from current issues, there are pastures new waiting to be discovered and enjoyed if you are willing to make the right moves. Yet, for the next few days, travel plans must be open to fresh scrutiny, mainly because circumstances are about to change. 
LIBRA, You must soon make a choice as to whether you will continue on your old course and maintain your existing lifestyle, or change direction completely. The pressure to alter your ways is still slight, but will intensify rapidly before long. In the meantime, have a breather! 
SCORPIO, There are ample indications that this can be a time of exploration, discovery and personal fulfilment for you. Partners will be more inclined to recognise your many gifts and abundant good points than in the past. And that has to be good news! 
SAGITTARIUS, There are some signs that the tide of fortune is about to turn in your favour. It is likely that, initially, you may experience little more than a reduction of pressure, but even this will be sufficient to open a window of opportunity into a new emotional life. 
CAPRICORN, One way or another you will have to alter your approach to career and personal interests. Be warned that niggling irritations could blow up unexpectedly - unless you deal with causes of discontent now. And, while you're at it, you'll turn a cash crisis to your advantage. 
AQUARIUS, There is every reason to hope that current developments in your private life will give you the courage and confidence to implement wide-ranging and sweeping improvements in your professional affairs. One thing is certain - that a long process of personal change is only just beginning. 
ARIES, As always, honesty is the best policy, even though Mars' energetic movements may encourage you to cut corners. Plus, it may not be easy to put everything important into words. Prepare now for impending domestic improvements, and win partners to your point of view. 
TAURUS, The Sun, Mercury and Venus are powerful allies and I honestly doubt if there is anyone who can get the better of you. Coast along on the crest of an optimistic wave and do not be drawn into emotional complications. Remember, you're on public view at the moment. 
GEMINI, You must realise that fear of failure is frequently the result of disapproval from parents or teachers when you were young. Such attitudes have entered your unconscious and now emerge as self-doubt. Do not let these vague, half-defined fears hold you back. 
CANCER, A group of planets pressuring the social areas of your horoscope suggest that one way or another you are about to be surprised and delighted by an unexpected encounter, possibly by a welcome twist of fate. Keep an eye on cash commitments or you'll end up paying more than your fair share. 
LEO, There is much that you can do to put other people in their place, especially at work. However, more important than what partners are up to, is how you handle the increasing and contradictory demands being put on your time by home commitments. Listen to older relations; they seem to have the best advice. 
VIRGO, Lightning never strikes twice in the same place, or so they say. This old adage is about to be proved right when a threatened emotional confrontation affects a partner, leaving you in the clear. All we can say is, you must have done something right! 
LIBRA, In domestic matters you should now be devoting all your time and energy to what is new, experimental and different. Trust your instincts and don't be slow to look to your own experience for inspiration. At home, children need nothing less than one hundred percent attention, so you'd better start rearranging your hours! 
SCORPIO, The burning question now is how you can make the most of partners' clearly favourable attitudes and good fortune without throwing your own proposals away. Just look and listen for a while and the way forward will become clear, even though it may be another four months before you are completely certain. 
SAGITTARIUS, What transpires now must not induce you to permit those who are less gifted, talented or experienced than you to dominate your progress. Yet it is probably more important to give than receive, and there may be nothing to lose by taking second place for the moment. 
CAPRICORN, Now that a number of planets have changed direction, you may begin to feel as if you are fighting an uphill battle and may not be sure who to turn to. There might be something to be said for putting important plans on hold, but not until you have made your feelings clear. 
AQUARIUS, Be positive and face awkward situations head-on. Only when grumbles and discontent at home have been dealt with, will you be free to make much-needed improvements. However trivial the events you're experiencing, please remember that your life is currently turning a very major corner. 
ARIES, Whatever partners may say, there seems little danger that you will become too demanding in your approach. Professional efforts and expertise will soon begin to pay off in increased earnings, but only once partners have settled down. A younger relation may have the best advice, so listen carefully and learn well. 
TAURUS, You should no longer need to distance yourself from situations which have churned up your emotions or made you feel victimised. Extraordinarily ambitious aspects will give you a fresh and exciting attitude, but naturally are likely to bring extra commitments, so get ready! 
GEMINI, You must be prepared to take a more relaxed attitude to matrimonial and private affairs. It is important that you follow your dreams; do not give too much weight to practical concerns, but give proper moral consideration to all difficult questions. 
CANCER, You are coping well with partnerships, including relationships with colleagues at work, when all is said and done. Take encouragement from the fact that disturbing and perhaps underhand events have almost run their course, and don't shrink from facing up to the past at home. 
LEO, The important thing is to remember that while one line of development in career matters is now well under way, another is only just beginning to move. The situation is quite complicated, yet definitely favourable. You just have to recognise that partners hold the trump cards. 
VIRGO, Close companions are ready to move forward, but it is up to you to give your approval - together with assurances that you are ready to offer a practical hand. Your ideas will be welcomed if you put them over with style - and a willingness to take a totally new approach. 
LIBRA, So much appears to have changed in your innermost thoughts and emotions that you may be quite justified in feeling slightly disorientated. However, now you must concentrate on matters in hand, such as financial arrangements and sorting out your investments or savings. 
SCORPIO, In some senses, current planetary aspects are sufficient to try the patience of a saint, and you may have to put up with other people who think they know it all. However, once you talk about contentious issues, you'll be surprised how quickly an amicable agreement is reached. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's because Jupiter is still occupying a dominant position that you believe others have the right to make you accept whatever they offer. Yet you may still question their terms without fear of being thought ungrateful. In other words, don't take whatever you're offered just because it's there. 
CAPRICORN, Your planets are encouraging you to make a few bold moves and decisions, instead of waiting for others to make their intentions plain. Remember that love is a more powerful motivation than self-interest, so give first and you'll receive later. 
AQUARIUS, Jan. 21 - Feb. 19) Play for time if you feel ill-at-ease or unhappy about an offer. Pluto is warning you that, even though favourable conditions seem set to continue, anything which affects your deepest emotional security must be handled with your usual sensitivity. 
ARIES, It's a mixed week, and you should be prepared for each day to take you on a new path. Although immediate concerns seem to be based around minor money and financial issues, a major opportunity is in the offing, one which could have a dramatic effect on your status and security for years to come. 
TAURUS, Your stars maintain a generally positive outlook, and in many respects your task is clear: somehow you must combine a willingness to seize any and every opportunity with a realisation that you should keep your feet firmly on the ground. 
GEMINI, It is surely time both to ask for advice, and to listen to what you are told! You may be too proud to do that, but try to see that the current situation is not one where it counts who wins and who loses. Rather, it's all a matter of doing what is best for now. 
CANCER, It is time to be open, frank and honest, and now is not the moment to hold back if there are important things to be said, perhaps about problems which have been simmering away beneath the surface for too long. The chances for agreement are excellent, by the way, so be sure to find common ground whenever you can. 
LEO, Serious Saturnine alignments indicate that your stars couldn't be better for sensible and constructive social progress, whether you're bringing imaginative schemes to a routine close or planning a major advance in your long-term ambitions. 
VIRGO, It is time to broaden your horizons. You may continue to follow an adventurous path, taking the line of least resistance where necessary. There is little point in being hard on yourself, and you should learn to accept compliments and offers of help with good grace. 
LIBRA, It's a strange time to be sure, and you may be weary of the responsibilities you're burdened with and the people who pester you. Yet, there is neither change nor progress without hard work. The kind of challenges you will face are from partners and loved ones who only have your best interests at heart. 
SCORPIO, Most people are on your side, but some may not agree with your ideas. Those friends and companions who habitually oppose your plans may be a source of irritation, yet they will have a positive influence on your life if they force you to look at your activities in a fresh light. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your planets are certainly changeable. In general, your mornings seem to be more optimistic than your afternoons, so you should always hatch your plans early on in the day and ask for help as soon as you possibly can. Above all, pay attention to partners' little qualms and queries. 
CAPRICORN, Please keep an eye open for any legal or ethical complications. Such minor glitches are easily avoided, and should be simply dealt with if they do arise. It's all a question of maximising your potential by steering clear of hidden pitfalls. 
AQUARIUS, As you know well enough, a positive outcome always depends on your readiness to take the initiative. Frustration regarding your domestic situation may now be eased by taking active steps to make whatever improvements are necessary, from minor adjustments to a move of home. Family relationships must also be taken into account. 
ARIES, The Moon reaches a climax in its cycle in relation to a deeply emotional region of your chart. But what happens next is anyone's guess. That's partly because while it is easy to forecast rising tension nobody can predict exactly how you will respond. All I'd say is: at all times keep at least one foot where it's supposed to be - on the ground. 
TAURUS, You are undoubtedly ready to make your move. But I think that's because you're already sensing possibilities which might not arrive until tomorrow. Today favours open horizons and far-sighted approaches to narrow-minded people, but you might be best off leaving the cutting edge to those who really know what's happening. 
GEMINI, There is so much to learn from your current situation. Even minor, trivial day-to-day events can possess a much deeper significance; but even if you don't 'get it' straight away, you'll have another chance next month - and the month after that! 
CANCER, What's bugging you? Could it be the feeling that you're not getting anywhere? Or that someone has let you down? In either case it looks as if you're about to feel a whole lot better, but only if you link up with partners and allow them to take the lead. You absolutely have to extend the hand of friendship to friends and rivals alike. 
LEO, Both today's leading planetary aspects are imaginative, even a little mystical in tone. How can you benefit from this? For a start, you can listen to your dreams. And if you can't remember your dreams, listen to your day-dreams. They're not all complete nonsense, and there may be pointers to the solution of a genuine problem. 
VIRGO, I think you deserve a jolly good holiday. You're a workaholic by nature, so you always have work to squeeze in some spare time, but perhaps I could plead with you to go easy on yourself and have as much time off as you can. Your financial fortunes are about to change, with adjustments expected both in your income and spending. 
LIBRA, If I advise you to pause for thought, it's because your planets are urging you to rush ahead. You could be increasingly impatient, but your circumstances are changing - and that's why you will have to consider every step with due care and attention. And, at work, it's who you know - and how you get on with them - that counts. 
SCORPIO, There's one of those Sun-Moon alignments today which stirs up emotions and creates excitement. You'll probably have some financial loose ends to sort out, but you'll soon realise that an issue which was bugging you wasn't so important after all. Remember - your emotional stars are still beneficial, and that should reinforce your romantic confidence. 
SAGITTARIUS, Today's situation is somewhat unusual. It's the second time this year that you've faced a challenge between the Sun and the Moon in your sign and you may have a sense of dejà vu - as if you've been here before. The only difference is that this time around you have the chance to actually do something about it! 
CAPRICORN, You may be a bit unsteady on your feet, emotionally speaking, but that's quite natural. After all, the Sun and the Moon are facing each other down in somewhat sensitive regions of your chart. Perhaps it's an ideal moment to carry on with private matters, which don't involve other people, but which mean a great deal to you. 
AQUARIUS, You're in an excellent position socially, even though some friends may be in an unpredictable mood. Still, just because they don't always see eye-to-eye, that's no reason why you should take it on yourself to bring order to chaos. A relationship could still be hard work, but then, the more effort you put into it the better your rewards. 
ARIES, If we look at your key celestial indications today, then adventure and independence are pretty strong. That all adds up to a moment when you can lift your sights to higher things, to elevate your ambitions and pursue your grand vision of the way life could be. All you have to do is refuse to give in to rash impulses. 
TAURUS, Would it motivate you if cash bonuses were on the cards? Or would it matter to you if your costs were increasing? These are the sort of questions you're facing over the next couple of days. Just remember though - in relationships, you have to keep talking; why not tell someone how you really feel about them? 
GEMINI, There's a conservative feel in the air today, as if you are tied to the feelings and emotions of the past. The people you'll hang out with could be older or more experienced but, also, if you've got the freedom bug, probably those you blame for holding you back. After all, there have been occasions on which you have yourself turned down intriguing offers. 
CANCER, Venus, the most gracious of planets, and Saturn, the most stern of the celestial bodies, are in a state of some disagreement. There are two choices: either you will discipline yourself, or someone else will do it for you. I'd say it would be best if you take the first steps when you are good and ready! 
LEO, You have reason to become confident, buoyant and often bubbly. But, and this is a big ‘but', circumstances imposed on you by other people may force you to stay your hand, contain your feelings and take a mature and responsible course when your instincts are urging you to break out and have a wild time. You've got a delicate balancing act to follow. 
VIRGO, Most of you have already put old problems and battles behind you, but the planets still have to draw a final curtain over the past. That is what they are now doing - today and tomorrow. After this your sign will be strangely free from planetary pressures, and you will be released from certain bonds. 
LIBRA, A new cycle begins over the next forty-eight hours, so many of you may feel a sudden increase in energy. It may feel as if you're on a jet accelerating to take-off - or a space-shuttle leaving earth's orbit. But don't fall into the trap of imagining that it's other people who are holding you back when all they've done is try to give good advice. 
SCORPIO, Time to take a look at your cash situation. The Moon advises you to make family finances your top priority, and other planets confirm that joint finances are the most important. You might be dependent on partners to make the first move, but then they will benefit enormously from your ideas - so speak up! 
SAGITTARIUS, You're top of the pile today. Your sign has the strongest planets and that's a fair enough indication that you'll have the advantage in most situations. It's not that you're any better than other people, just that, somehow, the celestial spotlight is on you. That's why you carry such a responsibility! 
CAPRICORN, Listen to your dreams. It seems as if a passing fantasy or day-dream could contain the seeds of a very positive path forward. It's probably not a good day for rushing into new initiatives, though, partly because you could see a pronounced shift in circumstances over the next two weeks. 
AQUARIUS, A significantly-situated Moon pushes domestic matters up your agenda. This is your chance to take control and insist that whatever happens is for everyone's benefit, remembering that you also need to share any good-fortune with family members. In addition, there may be a strange tie-up between personal and professional commitments. 
ARIES, Your mood lightens, but perhaps not until late in the day. That's OK, though, for you have to try to see how those waves of intense feeling can be of use to you. For starters they will help you understand just how other people feel, and that has to be a good thing. Just remember that today is a moment to stick to the facts - as closely as you can. 
TAURUS, If other people are getting on your nerves then the end is in sight - or at least a temporary respite; it all depends how deep your irritation goes. You can probably do yourself a great deal of good by letting partners do whatever they must while keeping your distance. You are entitled to defend yourself in any appropriate manner. 
GEMINI, There's a wonderful song with the words in which the singer tells how he can see clearly now that the rain has gone. That's a little like the feelings you could experience today, now that the Moon is taking up an entirely more open and honest position. My first and major piece of advice would be to listen to partners' words and give them the space they need. 
CANCER, Time for some of your sensible thoughts, I think. You're still inclined to worry about nothing, so why not sit down, make out a list of your doubts and questions, with their possible solutions and answers, and try to figure out what you can actually do. And, remember, with Venus positively placed, there is always help and support should you need it. 
LEO, In common with several other signs, you'll experience a lightening of your state of mind today, although the timing will be different for each one of you. The planetary system shifts towards increasing adventurousness, and you'll re- discover the courage to pursue some of your more creative goals, including, for some of you, a romantic tryst. 
VIRGO, If it's love you're interested in today brings one of those delicate, inspired and beautiful planetary alignments that could see enlightened, inventive and creative new feelings. And that points to the chance of a delightful personal encounter. It's also great, by the way, for all artistic types. 
LIBRA, You're still a little bit cagey, unsure of whom you can confide in. But, then, you're probably right to be defensive - at least until you know exactly what's going on. By late today you'll have a much better idea of where you stand, and you'll be confident enough to state your case. That looks like good news to me, just as long as you stick to the point! 
SCORPIO, Mars, your planetary ruler, is on fine form today, hooking up with Venusian elements in your chart. In simple terms, this means that there is room for passion and pleasure. Really, it all depends whether you have truly tied up all loose ends dating back over the last six months. If you haven't, you still might not have much time off. 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus and Saturn are a wonderful pair of planets, encouraging conventional relationships and conservative lifestyles. I guess the question is whether this suits you - or not! It all depends how patient you are. Can you wait until tomorrow? The best advice is probably to do so - or even to wait until next week. 
CAPRICORN, Your planetary ruler, Saturn, has a serious, sober reputation. It's making a neat alignment today, one which gets you thinking. First of all, you'll gather the information, then you'll face the facts. Lastly, you'll take a considered judgment. At least, that's the best possible outcome! 
AQUARIUS, You're never that comfortable when feelings are intense, so you could be relieved as the hours pass and emotions lighten. Mind you, it's not a day to break ranks. I'd say that you'll do well if you pause for thought, put your fantasies to one side and take a long, hard, serious look at all important invitations. 
ARIES, Everything hinges around your ability to do business. To follow the money metaphor through, you'll also be counting the cost of an emotional entanglement. But whether the price is worth paying is something only you can decide. Ultimately your decision must be based as much on what partners need as on what you want. 
TAURUS, Partners won't have everything their own way; in spite of appearances they never really do. But they do seem to hold the key, and there are times when they speak, you have to jump. Or, of course, you can always go into one of your famous obstinate moods - and completely ignore them! 
GEMINI, The days pass, your emotions change, and it seems that today you'll be even more emotional. A chance, perhaps, for you to get in touch with all those deep feelings you've bottled up for too long. Domestic circumstances are changing, and I hope that by this time next week the stress level will have dipped noticeably. 
CANCER, You're such a worrier. But then you know that already. After all, that's one of the building blocks of your astrological character. Just at the moment I'd say that what you have to do now is sort out which of your doubts is genuine, and which is no more than a mirage in your mind. 
LEO, Your weekly horoscope is one of diversity and choice, so you can pick your own direction, and devise your personal strategy. Yet, your daily chart raises intense emotions, and puts the focus firmly on home affairs and family relationships. Tackle domestic issues and it looks as if other blockages will then begin to shift. 
VIRGO, You're coming to the end of a six-month period of planetary stress. It's been slightly different for each one of you, for no Virgo is exactly the same as any other. That's obvious! But what you share is your tendency to worry about nothing - but that's about to change. You'll soon wonder what you were ever concerned about! 
LIBRA, It's time to move on. You may have got the feeling that life would never change, that the same people would be around for ever, or that the future was set in stone. If so, you forgot the fundamental law of the astrological universe - that all things must pass. And that's precisely why you can now make a fresh start. 
SCORPIO, You're in a strong position today. Sure, you could be a little emotional but, as long as you direct your feelings in a positive direction, you'll be able to spread your share of love and light. Funnily enough, today's planets also favour everyone messing about on boats. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're bound to be slightly uncertain, but then I think that's precisely why you're in such a powerful position; inconsistency can be a virtue! You'll be able to make the most of mysterious developments, especially ones which come loaded with deep significance and symbolic meaning! Don't rush it, though. 
CAPRICORN, Your social stars are highlighted, but it could be family members who make the best friends. Don't forget those friends who actually feel like they're part of the family! Watch out for floating legal problems or moral minefields, as the last thing you want now is to be embroiled in a messy dispute. Keep your nose clean! 
AQUARIUS, Professional Aquarians should be on good form. Astrologers often talk about your idealism, but they rarely mention that your work, or community activities, provide one of the most powerful areas for you to do your bit to make a better world and heal the wounds which divide people. But that is what is noticeable about your chart at the moment. 
ARIES, There could be an air of expectation all week, largely due to your lunar alignments. This generates a sense that while life is good, you never know what is around the next corner. Quite right, too. And that's why you must be on your guard. You're also in quite an inventive frame of mind, by the way, so look for imaginative solutions to old problems. 
TAURUS, The Moon's position has to be watched for most daily ups and downs, and today's patterns are curious ones. It's as if the mood of the times suits you but the circumstances might not. So, if you feel slightly short-changed, it could be because you're not making the most of a mixed day. You can always just pause for breath and wait till you catch up with yourself. 
GEMINI, There's an increasing sense of tension, perhaps passion. But are you comfortable with this? I suspect not. Not that is, unless you devote yourself to worthy causes and selfless duties. The downside is that you could expose yourself to exploitation so, rather than become a doormat, why not pick and choose the people you're prepared to help? 
CANCER, You're such a sensitive soul that it's always pleasant when you think that you're getting the support you feel you need. Which means that people you love are on your side for a change - which is not always the way that it seems! You're still keeping some of your plans to yourself - and why not? 
LEO, You may be in a strange state, quite happy to say what you think on the one hand, but not to reveal your true feelings on the other. Perhaps you're right. Perhaps you're not confident enough in your emotions to be able to talk about them yet. And, if that's the case, all you can do is wait until the time and place - and the people - are right. 
VIRGO, There is a great deal to be said for standing your ground. But, I'm not sure if it's enough. There's an old eastern proverb that the branch which bends in the wind stays on the tree. That's a way of saying that, in a week of change, complete flexibility is probably your best option. 
LIBRA, The surface may be calm, but in the astrological universe there's a great deal bubbling underneath - and it's all about to burst through. In straight, practical terms, your energy is soon to increase, but you'll also be growing more impatient and eager to push your plans into effect - at any cost. 
SCORPIO, If we look over the next week, then it seems that the changes you experience will be indirect, by which I mean that they could come via other people, or in ways you didn't expect. In either case, the next month could be a time of mystery. The truth could lie in your intuition and imagination - tempered with real facts, of course. 
SAGITTARIUS, There's a time to move - and a time to stand still. And this, I'd say, is a time to stand still. As is tomorrow and the day after. Yet by the end of the week you'll be moving fast. That is the planetary prognosis. Now all you have to do is arrange your daily diary to fit in with the celestial formations. 
CAPRICORN, Partners are in a generally supportive frame of mind. But then that's only as much as you'd expect. But it is a situation you can encourage by praising, boosting, flattering and helping them. In other words, don't wait for them to come to you; it's you who has to make the first move. Looking ahead, your professional stars are about to expose new, untested ambitions. 
AQUARIUS, You could be taking on fresh responsibilities, mainly emotional ones. Even at work a new task could have a sense of personal, almost parental, commitment about it. There's also a vague spot of financial confusion around, but you'll be tempted to give money to worthwhile causes - and that can only do you good. 
ARIES, It's time to climb to the highest heights. Over the next two weeks you'll be presented with an opportunity to achieve a life-long goal. It may be that you're after the top job, but the perfect love is also on offer. But what's more likely is that you'll pursue some purely private interest. 
TAURUS, You're certainly on a winning ticket, but that doesn't mean that life will all be plain sailing. Rather, you should take all challenges in your stride, relishing the opportunity to stretch yourself and gain new experience. And, if you're planning a holiday, go for adventure. 
GEMINI, You're about to discover hidden business talents. You may not be a budding billionaire but your high-flying ideas could soon earn you a quick buck. Geminian lovers will be concerned about the cost of romance. There may even be an emotional price to pay, so keep a careful account! 
CANCER, If partners are a mite overwhelming this week don't even think about fighting back. Once the emotional missiles start to fly, you should stay out of the way. And, even if loved ones don't succeed by brute force, they'll win you over through charm and flattery. 
LEO, You weren't really born to be a slave, so what on earth are you doing now? It's one thing to work hard, to serve your fellow human beings and make the world a better place, quite another to allow yourself to be exploited. Stop being such a doormat! 
VIRGO, If you're having fun, try to spin it out for as long as you can. And, if you're at work, up to your eyes in routine chores and boring commitments, lighten your load by introducing as many creative ideas as you can. Your favourite social activities should be traditional, so aim for a thoroughly conventional evening out. 
LIBRA, You'll have to make some finely-balanced choices. If you should feel that your personal security is being threatened, don't panic. It's time for wide-ranging improvements at home and, if you refuse to bow to the pressure for change, you're bound to feel a little uncertain. 
SCORPIO, Think long and hard and don't let anyone push you into a corner. You have to take your own decisions in your own time, regardless of partners' habits and opinions. This is an ideal moment, by the way, for job interviews. Aim for the best and you'll surpass all previous expectations. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're great on the theory but not so hot on the practice! Why do you keep falling into the same old financial trap? You've been through muddle, extravagance and deception often enough in the past not to want to experience more of the same now. All will be well if you are completely honest and open with loved ones and colleagues. 
CAPRICORN, Take a deep breath. You're now approaching a major crossroads and your personal affairs may never be the same again. No matter which way you turn, you're faced with the chance to change, so no ducking out at the last moment. All you need is confidence - and a little courage! 
AQUARIUS, Tread ever so carefully and don't get tangled up in too many plots or conspiracies. If you're fond of gossip you'll have a fabulous week, but do be warned that any rumours could rebound on you. If you get more deeply involved in a charitable enterprise, you'll find that helping people can be fun. 
ARIES, You have a great deal to say for yourself, and now is the time to say it. Even though the tone of the times is definitely impatient, you may begin to slow the pace in various practical projects, and even change your mind over long-term plans, and all without offending partners! 
TAURUS, Your stars really are looking quite marvellously profitable, and not a little extravagant. It scarcely matters whether you devote your day to saving or shopping, just as long as you gain a sense of satisfaction - and the feeling of a good day well spent. 
GEMINI, The Sun aligns with your chart in a sensitive formation which brings passion and, with it, peace - but only for a while. This is an ideal moment to make friends and fall in love, so hopefully the day-to-day world can be put on hold! But you will have to make the running, otherwise opportunities will slip by unnoticed. 
CANCER, This could be quite a busy time, which means that even when relaxing you'll remain active. Hopefully, once routine chores have been dealt with, you will have enough energy left over for a favourite interest: you know you have it in you to achieve great things. 
LEO, Your social stars have been strong lately, and today they achieve yet another of their periodic perfect alignments. A hint of fantasy or mystery will now add spice to romantic liaisons. But what you really need is variety - and a sense that new options are opening up. 
VIRGO, If your professional hopes are high, there is no better day than today for building contacts and getting in touch. In fact, you need to move forward on all fronts whether your ambitions are personal or professional. Circumstances may stand in your way, in which case concentrate on any community or voluntary activities. 
LIBRA, Your romantic hopes will soon span the globe. This could mean that you love all humanity, or that the person dear to you is far away. It could also mean that there is a great distance between you and someone close to your heart, a distance which needs to be spanned now. 
SCORPIO, Simple cash issues, such as how much you've got in your purse, determine what you can and can't get away with today. This is an extraordinarily positive moment for teaming up with partners in projects which combine business with pleasure. In short, the thing you want might be the thing you need! 
SAGITTARIUS, You may be feeling a little more emotional than usual, but that's good if it helps you bring out your caring and compassionate qualities, breaking down a few personal barriers in the process. Please don't be too sensitive to criticism though - it might be good for you! 
CAPRICORN, You will be keeping yourself to yourself today, and even when you're in company there'll be much going on in your head and in your heart that other people can only guess at. You may even consider cancelling at least one engagement - but you don't want to let someone down, either. 
AQUARIUS, You may like to seek solace and support in the arms of your friends after what, by all accounts, has been a fairly important time in your life. Even in imperceptible ways, trivial events over the past fortnight have changed the future irrevocably. You'll find out how in good time. 
ARIES, Something is not quite right in your business or financial life, but losses or mysteries are temporary. The best advice in this, and similar matters, is never to jump to conclusions, but always to go back and check that you have got your facts straight. 
TAURUS, From your current planetary picture it is clear that there are genuine and well-founded hopes of an increase in earnings, probably as a result of a great deal of thankless effort you put in the past. Don't expect the heavens to open and shower you with good luck. The world doesn't work like that, so make your own fabulous fortune! 
GEMINI, You must keep other people sweet, for you never know when you might need them. Actually, social confidence should be one of your gifts at the moment and it is also exactly what partners require, for if they are to be truthful they will admit that they've not been as happy as they could have been. 
CANCER, Feelings are funny things - as you know only too well. There are certain times of the month when you should feel free to be overwhelmed by emotion without explaining yourself or justifying your actions. This is one such moment. If partners do demand reasons, answer them in riddles! 
LEO, Your personal affairs should be more important than professional commitments. Even if you are absolutely forced to go to work or clear up after other people, you should see to it that life reflects what you want rather than what society dictates - within reason, of course! 
VIRGO, This is one of those days when you might well receive significant news from the past. Some people think it is bad to have one's opinions and actions shaped by what happened long ago, but right now this is probably necessary. After all, the past is ever present! 
LIBRA, Self-confidence is your most important quality at the moment. Any bright idea at work is likely to bring the money rolling in, probably in quite unexpected ways, any time over the next three months. It's difficult to make firm plans, but that's as true for partners as for you. 
SCORPIO, Conflicts, criticism and pressures at work or in public matters will soon ease, but only after there have been several other major developments. What seems to be exceptionally powerful at the moment is a sense that cash rewards are more important than gratitude. Oh, and an employer should put their money where their mouth is! 
SAGITTARIUS, If it pleases you, keep something very important to yourself. There is no reason at all why you shouldn't have your secrets. In love you should still allow partners to take the initiative, partly because it really looks as if they have some of the best ideas. 
CAPRICORN, You won't lose face now if you seek support over private affairs. In fact, you should be relieved when partners show themselves capable of looking at the facts, rather than taking a personal and emotional stand. You see, your feelings might make sense to you, but not to others. 
AQUARIUS, Have a last emotional stab at a particular professional venture. If you're involved in a community enterprise, you must realise that others will not share your beliefs. In love, enjoy any opportunity to be thoroughly sloppy and sentimental - and to indulge your desires. 
ARIES, In personal relationships the physical dimension will be important, and in business it will be the cash account that matters. You should think very carefully about how social activities may impinge on professional work and public duties, and vice versa. 
TAURUS, You should take any delays or frustrations in your stride, for today is one of those moments when it's best to carry on with the job in hand without expecting marvellous results or a dramatic leap into the unknown. You'll get your reward - but perhaps not yet. 
GEMINI, Your stars look profitable and prosperous, so you'll very soon be coming up with a whole series of ideas on how to make some spare cash. That's stage one. Stage two, which is much more difficult, is to work out how you're going to put the theory into practice. 
CANCER, There are still one or two things you should keep to yourself, and your views on an emotional matter should go unspoken for a little while longer. However where once you found it so awkward to express yourself, you will soon have no difficulty. 
LEO, You are by your nature often far too open and honest, sometimes for your own good. Yet for the next fortnight at least you will be keeping certain truths to yourself. There is nothing wrong with secrets just as long as you have absolutely no intention to mislead. 
VIRGO, You should balance the books - the emotional ones as well as the financial! It now looks as if an account has to be settled and a debt repaid before personal relationships can take a further step. It may be that you need not cash rewards, but acknowledgement for all your efforts. 
LIBRA, Perfection is in the air, and you may enjoy any ray of light and every glimmer of hope which comes your way. If you should touch the clouds, however, do remember that the only thing which is permanent is change. You don't want to come down to earth with too much of a bump! 
SCORPIO, Business and work planets are ideally poised to bring rewards, albeit slight ones, for all the hard effort you've put in. If somebody you trust makes a suitable offer then you may now take it, rather than waiting for something much better to come along. 
SAGITTARIUS, In no circumstances should you try to turn the clock back. It can be tempting to imagine that the past was preferable to the present, even for you, but do understand now that the future looks bright. You may expand your social circle and make new friends. 
CAPRICORN, You should set the wheels in motion and get personal initiatives under way. You may also have to pay extra attention to partners' ideas over the next two to four weeks, and you can now set the pace by extending invitations to like-minded friends and colleagues. 
AQUARIUS, There are certain periods in the year when the planets send out powerful messages, indicating that you are at a turning-point. This is one such time, which means that all decisions should be made with great care, for you may not be able to change them later on. 
ARIES,: You will have to listen very carefully to both criticism and advice. The point is that people who are trying to help you out will know what needs to be said, but perhaps not how to say it. Don't let the so-called facts get in the way - if only because they might be the wrong ones! 
TAURUS, It will pay to keep your distance and accept that there is a price to pay for personal intimacy. The Moon will soon be in a helpful place, so you may easily reduce the emotional temperature and enjoy yourself at the same time. And if somebody is keeping a secret, it might be for a very good reason. 
GEMINI, Once you have come to terms with enforced changes you should begin to see how to improve your bargaining position. From today you'll realise how a financial situation can be handled so much better. For a start, you can take control of circumstances rather than waiting for favourable conditions to turn up. 
CANCER, All your planning and hard work may come to nothing if you fail to keep partners informed: if they don't know what's going on, you can't blame them for putting a spanner in the works. You'll very soon move happily into a much more communicative phase. 
LEO, You should be able to make up your mind at last. In fact, I'd say that you must take certain decisions now, especially if they affect your long-term security. There are indications that, whichever way you jump, the results will be to your liking. And that can't be bad! 
VIRGO, Circumstances beyond your control are likely to alter much that you have come to take for granted, starting with financial plans and agreements. You may give all the time that is needed to talking about your needs at home, especially your desire for domestic security. 
LIBRA, The coming period brings planetary alignments that are well-nigh perfect. If ever you were in a position to make that final leap into a state of perpetual harmony, this is it. Make sure your feet don't leave the ground, though. In other words, keep going! 
SCORPIO, You are quite happy in the knowledge that you don't know what's going on. That's good, for you should not be troubled by the sort of little uncertainties that could be a feature of your life at the moment. You need to let other people shine, by the way, so stand back and give credit where it's due. 
SAGITTARIUS, If nobody has been willing to share your burdens in the past, have another go at soliciting support today. You may find friends in such a good mood that you can catch them off guard and lure them into uncharacteristic commitments. Whether that's good for the future or not is an open question! 
CAPRICORN, There are a number of hurdles yet to be overcome, one of which is self-doubt. Believe in yourself and the whole world will believe in you, too! At least, partners will give you a lot more credit for your better ideas. When you take a second look, an apparent obstacle might actually be a major advantage. 
AQUARIUS, You're on a major cycle which deals with emerging maturity and wisdom, and today and tomorrow you're hitting a critical point along the way. This could be a moment to pause for self-congratulation, but also to plan the fundamental direction of your life over the coming years. 
ARIES, You still have a fair amount of energy, and you mustn't waste time if you have important matters to complete. By next week your stars will be more relaxed, which could be a relief but also indicates that it might be somewhat less easy to achieve your aims. 
TAURUS, Seen from one angle your stars present you as being on the winning side and not likely to be deceived or exploited. The essential message, though, is that you can turn all available circumstances to good advantage if you throw yourself into idealistic endeavours, forgetting self-interest and trusting in the future. 
GEMINI, The weight of celestial patterns is still on your side, enabling you to swing almost any development to your benefit. At home, it's all a question of being businesslike, and insisting that people obey the rules, watch the clock and do what they're told. 
CANCER, You can keep a secret, but only for a little while longer. Today's stars tell a double story; urging you to talk to partners, but advising you to hold your tongue when it comes to certain delicate matters. The last thing you want to do now is cause offence. 
LEO, The business of day-to-day survival looms large, and it is to those little but necessary things that you must turn your attention. No item should be considered too small or too dull to warrant your best efforts. And don't imagine that it's OK to leave routine matters to others just because they're boring. 
VIRGO, Happily, lunar alignments are infusing and enthusing the region of the zodiac occupied by your sign. The consequence is that you could be rather more sensitive than usual, but also increasingly able to appreciate emotional improvements. And if you feel better, so should the people you love. 
LIBRA, You would be wise to keep yourself to yourself today, at least when you sense that irrational opposition is looming. There may be a family mystery to solve, but it seems unlikely that answers will be available before tomorrow, so you should be patient. 
SCORPIO, There is much to be said for teamwork today, so make an effort to co-operate, and don't even think about going it alone. If you're still recovering from a trauma at work or a rejection at home, you will probably have forgotten all about it by next week. 
SAGITTARIUS, No amount of argument must prevent you from forging ahead with major alterations in your personal life. Partners' advice, while well-intentioned, often seems to miss the point, so make your own decisions today. Mind you, you'll have to accept responsibility if your plans don't work out. 
CAPRICORN, There seems to be a powerful indication of long-distance contacts today, perhaps associated with family connections. You may actually be dreaming of life in distant parts. It would be nice to escape, if only for a while. Why not see if it can be arranged? 
AQUARIUS, The general planetary indications are positive, but the upside is that you'll be given a chance to make firm constructive progress, and then to sort out a hundred and one practical details and irritations. Other people will accept your plans - but only if you give them good reason. 
ARIES, A new and refreshing period is due to begin under celestial configurations which are considerably easier than they have been for some time. Your personal resolutions should be low-key, flexible and positive. What's best is that a romantic goal now lies within your reach - at long last! 
TAURUS, Everything is pulling you away from purely private issues towards questions involving other people and far away places. Sensible Taureans will enter a positive new personal phase with a good long holiday - or whatever break you can manage. Even just a day off would help! 
GEMINI, Let partners take the lead as you glide across the dance floor of life. You'll be doing the quickstep as, deep down, you realise that there's no time to waste. Harmonise with the celestial spheres as only you can. Also, everything that happens can be considered a learning experience. 
CANCER, Partners have always treated you as if you were much tougher than you really are. You can start the next period of your life by showing them the depths of your vulnerability. This in itself requires a great deal of courage. If anyone has the advantage it is probably you, so use your talents wisely. 
LEO, It's a busy start to a bright period, but then Leos are usually able to make the most of even unpromising circumstances. However, it looks very much as if a pleasant surprise is on the way, partly thanks to the lively presence of Mercury and Mars in encouraging regions of your solar chart. 
VIRGO, The great news is that everything good will centre on the home. There will be a lot going on, ninety percent of it to your liking. As for the other ten percent - well, perhaps you can just look the other way. One thing is certain, which is that you can't afford to let the initiative slip from your hands. 
LIBRA, The most active stars are in a curious and inquisitive region of your chart. Your mind is alive with new ideas and revelations. Take time to think through your plans in greater detail and give yourself time to get them right. If other people have things on their mind, please offer whatever advice you can. 
SCORPIO, An intriguing personal period will finally come to an end this week and you'll begin to count the cost, emotional and otherwise. You'll also think about where you go from here, and who you want to be with. Businesslike Scorpios will launch themselves into the coming period with no backward glance. 
SAGITTARIUS, The combination of Mercury, Venus and Mars will catapult you into the next phase of your life with a degree of enthusiasm remarkable even for a Sagittarian. Even social and romantic expenses won't dull your ardour. However far you have forced other people, they can still fight back, so take care. 
CAPRICORN, Even people who have been doubting your skills and talents will soon be forced to eat their words. Yet, just for now, you'll be keeping them in suspense: let partners sweat a little while longer. There is a great deal going on behind the scenes, and even the odd mystery or two! 
AQUARIUS, You have never been one to take too much for granted, and now it is your down-to-earth realism which lies at the foundations of what should be not just a successful week but an outstanding year. Your social stars are strong and growing stronger, so fall in love, have fun and make new friends. 
ARIES, Although the weekend looks relatively relaxed, you can never forget that you're an Aries. The long-term outlook is stormy, and recent disputes could soon come to a point of no return. It is time to face up to the truth on a number of personal issues, and do what you can to recreate a more harmonious situation. 
TAURUS, The current energetic planetary conditions may be to your liking, but in reality you're ready to enter a less stressful phase of existence. Whether this will come to pass or not is another matter and, as the weeks pass, the range of options open to you will increase. 
GEMINI, As there's an emotional Moon shining today, it's unlikely you'll have any real chance to relax. It's much better to keep on the go, but try to maintain your sense of self-preservation and avoid needless risks. Watch out if you're handling cash - you could be dreaming of great riches but about to make a blunder! 
CANCER, Tense planetary alignments could work to your advantage if only you are able to concentrate your efforts. If you ignore routine interests now, you may find that next week's plans unravel. The best advice, therefore, is to do the minimum necessary to keep your life ticking over - and spare time for a little fun. 
LEO, When the Moon supports your sign, as happens today, you tend to feel that the world is on your side. You'll find that a more open and flexible approach will deal with most routine problems. Even if you travel for pleasure, the results could be a shift of direction in a major long-term ambition. 
VIRGO, Today's stars will bring a boost to your energy, but only if you're in a receptive mood. Personal relationships require careful handling and you might have to put someone else's interests first, at least for today. Your financial sense is more shrewd than ever, so you are in an excellent position to pick up a bargain. 
LIBRA, It's been a week of uncertainty at work in spite of your undoubted achievements, and you're in need of a rest. However, domestic chores require attention and partners will keep you on the go. Yet, for once, you know best. If partners don't realise this, that's their problem! 
SCORPIO, Today's stars continue unsettling trends, but only in a mild sense. Actually, you can enjoy the fact that the future is up for grabs. Yet you must never give way to complacency, otherwise you'll lose control. The moment you relax, there'll be a minor crisis to cope with. 
SAGITTARIUS, Domestically, you may get the feeling that everything is working against you. However, you'll be surprised how soon partners come round to your way of thinking, with a little tact and sweet talk. Children and younger relations need a steadying hand, and you're just the person to provide it. 
CAPRICORN, Restless conditions are bound to affect every area of your life, and you're not in an ideal position to withstand disturbances to your routine. Make the most of every positive opportunity and try to see the present time as an excellent opportunity to deal with long-standing irritations. 
AQUARIUS, Money matters should be treated delicately, as mistakes could be costly. If you're concerned about a particular transaction, there's much to be gained from seeking a second, more experienced, opinion. An emotional relationship could be hard work but every extra effort will be worth it. 
ARIES, Confrontations at home will have a useful purpose if they help clear the air. In this sense an approaching clash with someone you live with is to be welcomed. However, you must remember that once you've made the peace, you'll have to keep it! 
TAURUS, Venus, your planetary ruler, has been instilling a greater than usual sense of practical necessity into your affairs, yet as soon as you have settled one problem, another will arise. Hopefully, there's been a corresponding increase in your self-confidence, and every difficulty will be turned to your advantage. 
GEMINI, Current stars could lead you in a number of directions although, in the build-up towards the next colourful, lunar picture, you will decide to drop or rearrange a number of commitments. How about indulging your charitable instincts? At home, listen to younger relations. They might have the best advice! 
CANCER, Get ready for a battle at work and take no nonsense from employers who think they have a hold over you. On the other hand, if you want to hang on to your present position, be firm and fair and don't let a clash of wills get out of control. 
LEO, You have two choices: either you can press on with worldly ambitions, or you can develop the mystical interests which have always attracted you. There's an outside chance that you can combine the two. A cash crisis should now lie in the past, leaving you free to rearrange affairs to your advantage. 
VIRGO, If your thoughts turn to money matters today, then all well and good. The more prepared you are, the better you'll be able to cope with any minor business crisis over the coming few days. Socially, your stars couldn't be better, although you're in danger of double-booking yourself. 
LIBRA, It's make or break time in a professional relationship, and conditions at work may not be entirely to your liking. There's every reason to reach agreement on all issues as soon as possible, before partners or colleagues have time to change their minds. 
SCORPIO, Secret fears may hold you back over the coming days, even though your worries are almost certainly groundless. If you acknowledge your lack of confidence and discuss the issues involved with partners, you'll do yourself a favour. Continue to press forward with travel plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mars has been pressurising your eighth solar house, the part of your horoscope ruling financial speculation. The promised turnaround in your business situation may have failed to materialise, perhaps because the truth is that the situation is more complicated than you first thought. 
CAPRICORN, There's no point in going it alone over the coming month, even though partners will be impossibly demanding at times. Make a stupendous effort to make sure everyone is happy with your behaviour and wait for the awards and rewards to roll in about three months' time. 
AQUARIUS, There'll be a chance to set the record straight, especially if a partnership has been causing you dissatisfaction. Your important task is to concentrate on what is best for the future, and that means facing up to a few tricky decisions. And about time too! 
ARIES, The course of domestic affairs will be all too easily coloured by misunderstandings, misplaced idealism and imaginary problems. Don't take confusing mishaps too seriously, otherwise you'll never find your way out of a current tangle. 
TAURUS, You'll soon be into a fresh personal phase, and there's stimulation to be expected from prospective new activities. If you refuse to develop your creative skills in whatever area they are needed, you'll be the loser. It's also a great moment to apply for a new job. 
GEMINI, You're still being washed around by the waters of fate - or at least by the aftermath of recent lunar patterns! Extravagance or carelessness in a financial matter could have repercussions for future security. The message is to take additional precautions, check guarantees and examine the small print with great care. 
CANCER, Something may have happened to unsettle you in recent days. Possibly someone has let you down at work, but that's no reason to give up a plan that's very worthwhile, whether other people support it or not. You'll do best to stick to the facts and ignore all rumours. 
LEO, Skeletons may be rattling in your cupboard this week, but then there's nothing new in that. If you are beginning to feel that it's time to simplify your life, giving up a number of commitments, you could be right. And please keep the lid on exploding expenses. 
VIRGO, The last thing you want to do today is get involved in routine money matters. It's much more useful, and far more enjoyable, to spend some of your gains and plot extravagant schemes for future earnings. If a partner is still upset, give them a few days to get over it. 
LIBRA, A suspicion will prove unfounded, although a family mystery may not be cleared up for another three weeks. On balance, good news is more likely than bad but, in any event, you'll be pushed back on your own resources. The problem just now is that it's not clear whether circumstances are on your side or not. 
SCORPIO, Friends from abroad are on your mind and you'll be highly motivated to get in touch with distant relatives. There may be some quite reasonable financial motive behind your actions, but partners will need persuading. Family affairs must be tidied up. 
SAGITTARIUS, For someone who is supposed to have a good head for facts, it's actually quite important to rely on your intuition when planning professional moves. You're also much more sensitive than usual to colleagues' interests - saintly and selfless, some might say! 
CAPRICORN, The general mood of the moment is romantic in the broadest sense. This means that you should feel there's far more scope than usual to express your compassionate, caring qualities. Wait for partners to take the initiative and consider offers you'd once have turned down. 
AQUARIUS, Career ambitions will tend to take precedence over family priorities, even if it's a partner's work, not yours, that is forcing the pace. There's no point in being overly idealistic, as you'll only misunderstand people's true potential. And why not give rivals the benefit of the doubt? At least for now! 
ARIES, Behind the scenes, quiet diplomacy could have favourable consequences. It may be time to reveal unknown aspects of your recent behaviour and stun unsuspecting colleagues with your better qualities. If you are shifting your professional direction, how about considering something in the charitable line? 
TAURUS, A major plan is coming to fruition and, assuming you've gained partners' approval, you can look forward to the future with a fair degree of optimism. Your old-fashioned attitudes will charm your friends and could open the door to a new romance - or help you revive a flagging relationship. 
GEMINI, Your most important objectives will become clearer from now on, despite the threat of a silly confrontation this morning. Come to firm decisions based on an accurate appraisal of all the facts, and continue to keep a close eye on your finances. 
CANCER, Social indications remain promising and casual contacts may have helpful consequences on your professional life or family arrangements. However, you must guard against today's overall risk of muddle and confusion - the Full Moon is broadly supportive but it is still too easy to give in to complacency. 
LEO, If you've been pondering secret plans, it will soon be time to take the initiative and make these public. The moment for open action has not yet arrived, however, and discretion may still be the best course. You will gain from joint investments, but you do need to see that they are absolutely and totally guaranteed. 
VIRGO, The Moon supports your sign, presenting you with a number of emotional challenges, most of them profoundly positive. You may be called away from home quite soon. If so, the cause is more likely to be the fulfilment of some deeply- held, long-term ambition, rather than routine concerns. In any event, the tide is flowing your way. 
LIBRA, Mercury is now sufficiently at home in your chart to be feeding you some of the best ideas and plans around. By all means work hard at promoting yourself and raising your profile at work or in social activities, but this is not the time to expect final decisions. Instead, you should attempt to extend your range of operations. 
SCORPIO, There's a distinct mood of uncertainty today, although you may be unaware that anything strange is afoot until you try to firm up agreements or commit associates to arrangements. The fact that the Moon aligns with emotional zones in your chart might encourage you to embark on a romantic adventure. Don't expect too much, too soon. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon shows the way ahead and whatever you do today will bring a massive pay-off sooner than you think. In the meantime, your social commitments are at least partially responsible for steadily mounting expenses, and that's precisely why it's within your power to reduce your overheads. Mild scepticism will help you deal with hare-brained schemes. 
CAPRICORN, Today's sensitive planetary pattern resonates nicely with your own horoscope, although you might misunderstand friends' intentions or behaviour. Keep a sense of realism well to the fore and remember that impulsive decisions may make sense today but will seem foolish by next week. 
AQUARIUS, Your tendency to hang on to the past is now a potent force in your life, even if you still believe yourself to be a forward-looking go-getter. You must try to be flexible in all matters requiring agreement with colleagues - especially if money is involved. 
ARIES, This is an ideal time to seriously think about implementing a number of long-term reforms in your private life. As usual, it's essential for your success that you involve partners in your plans, combining business with pleasure and perhaps organising a family gathering. 
TAURUS, A delicate relationship between Mercury and Venus will help you clear up a complex personal tangle. Friends will be able to appeal to your better nature and you'll be willing to listen to reason. Take extreme care where legal matters are involved and avoid any temptation to bend the rules. 
GEMINI, Important decisions on domestic reorganisation should be settled by now. At least, you should have more idea of where recent developments are taking you. Bear in mind that imagination and intuition will be more use to you than supposedly rational argument. 
CANCER, While Venus and Mars are so active, you'll come out on top every time. Certain professional pressures may have apparently eased up, but if you've been placing too much emphasis on work commitments at the expense of home affairs - or vice versa - correct the imbalance before someone accuses you of letting them down. 
LEO, The Moon's subtle association with your sign boosts your closest relationships but does give partners the last word. If you feel restless today then be sure to channel your energy more effectively, and don't let uncertainty at home have a debilitating effect on the more important areas of your life. 
VIRGO, It's a busy moment, and you're bound to feel a little over-worked, but then, the more you achieve now, the less you'll have on your plate later in the week. Pay heed to any warning signals that point to an uncontrolled increase in your expenses, probably backed up by little more than the hope that your income will increase accordingly. Don't over-reach yourself. 
LIBRA, The Sun continues its smooth and helpful passage through beneficial regions of your chart, but there's a slight problem on the horizon associated with a nagging doubt or a spot of confusion. Close attention to the facts of the situation will keep you on the straight and narrow. 
SCORPIO, It's inevitable that you'll be involved in routine matters, tedious as they sometimes are, yet don't let this blind you to today's deeper potential. There's great scope for you to put your talents at other people's disposal. Later in the day your mind will start to buzz, and you could come up with a dramatic answer to an old question. 
SAGITTARIUS, The time is soon approaching to consider the broader implications of your current personal plans, particularly financial schemes. It will be necessary to collect all the information you need on the legal situation before next month. Your emotional life looks expensive, but you must first decide whether a particular person deserves your generosity. 
CAPRICORN, On the whole, you'll do better now and over the next month or two if you see yourself as part of a team rather than a solitary adventurer. There'll be a number of occasions when you'll need moral support but today you could probably do with financial backing; there is now a very high chance of an increase in your income. 
AQUARIUS, When the Moon assists your sign, as it does today, it heightens your emotional sensitivity, making you feel that the odds are stacked against you. So this might not be the best day to sort out contentious emotional issues - or to get involved in trivial arguments. If you're changing jobs, steer clear of potential muddles. 
ARIES, Any tension in your partnerships could be a dynamic force for change over the coming weeks. This is a time to mix as widely as possible and soak up influences you'd normally shun. You're also likely to make big advances in your business plans. 
TAURUS, Your romantic stars are powerful and growing more so by the day, but partners may have the edge when it comes to a battle of wills. You may soon be obliged to accept an unhelpful situation as a fait accompli. Wait till next week for the tables to turn. 
GEMINI, Your preoccupation with financial affairs looks certain to recur on several occasions over the next year, so the more attention you pay to any irregularities now, the less time you'll need to devote to them later on. Fortunately, today's support from the Moon eases the way at home. 
CANCER, This is the week to complete all those tasks that must be finished before you can embark on the next stage of your plans. Something that is unclear about home arrangements may cause you to rearrange your schedule, but with Venus and Mars both offering you unqualified support you are on safe ground. 
LEO, You'll press ahead with domestic improvements, allowing time for other obligations where necessary. Family relationships will benefit from the same care you apply to your own special interests, although a domestic mystery is still provoking niggling suspicions. 
VIRGO, The planetary accent is on pleasure over the coming days, and the best way to personal fulfilment is through devoting extra time to your creative Virgoan skills. Ideally, you should now be on holiday rather than at work. Also, if you get a chance, turn the clock back. 
LIBRA, Try asking yourself whether all your recent actions have been for the best. In general you're heading in the right direction, but a little extra care now will prevent difficulties in the future. You are bound to feel put upon, but perhaps the message is to stand up for yourself next time! 
SCORPIO, By now Mercury is sufficiently entrenched in your house of dreams to have raised your morale and brought the hope of significant financial improvements. Be aware, though, that it's up to you to create the right conditions for success. A domestic revolution will soon be considered - but postponed. 
SAGITTARIUS, The obstacles which blocked your progress in the past should have been firmly dealt with some time ago. If you are still subject to unfair delays, it's possible you're doing something wrong. Do yourself a favour and learn new skills, including extra social graces. 
CAPRICORN, The high pressure of recent weeks is beginning to ease up. Hopefully you can look back on your achievements with pride. Even if there's been little tangible gain, you've grown in wisdom and experience. You could make a financial killing today, but only if the rules are changed. 
AQUARIUS, Jan. 21 - Feb. 19) Look upon today's events as a chance to prove your worth when it comes to hard work. Don't shirk responsibility and you'll prove that all those people who have ever accused you of being lazy and self-interested were completely wrong. By midweek you will have seized the moral high ground, much to partners' annoyance. 
ARIES, You are entering a fascinating phase. Your task, for nothing in astrology comes free from responsibility, is to acknowledge your emotional power, understand its source deep within your unconscious, and use it wisely. At such times, there is little to be gained from confronting other people. 
TAURUS, You are probably now acting in defiance of your Taurean character by being far more lively than usual. Your travel prospects at present are really quite remarkable and it does seem that adherence to a strict daily routine can only lead to frustration. 
GEMINI, You will be supported by the fact that Mercury, your sparkling planetary ruler, is in a helpful region, but could also be encouraging you to confuse your thoughts with your feelings. It may be that you will take decisions based on your desires, and prioritise your needs according to the facts. 
CANCER, Your major asset at the present time is self-confidence and it is the power of positive thought which will prove your greatest ally. Push ahead with domestic plans and don't be put off by difficult partners. By the way, you should perform impressively in professional relationships. 
LEO, It's time to put on your thinking cap. You may reflect on your life so far and consider carefully just what your next step should be. Also, develop those discreet mystical or spiritual interests which have so far been pushed to one side by the pressures to conform to a particular lifestyle. 
VIRGO, As a result of the fact that both the Sun and the Moon are providing helpful alignments, we may make a confident forecast of increasing prosperity over the next year. As more money comes your way, your fears over your lack of security will be appeased. 
LIBRA, Emotionally, this is a period during which you must continue the process you should already have begun, questioning all that is fundamental to your existence. Revise every assumption that you have ever held about relationships in general, as well as about one or two special individuals in particular. 
SCORPIO, In private, intimate and emotional situations, such as are developing now, the price you have to pay is always balanced by eventual rewards, yet these may come in a form which is at first difficult to recognise. You must therefore rely on your instincts, and ease yourself forward very carefully. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your future is intimately tied to that of your friends and colleagues. After all, none of us is an island, which means, if you go it alone, you'll miss out on all that vital support and forget essential details. But if you get other people on your side then they'll be protecting you against failure. 
CAPRICORN, Some of you have by now got the idea that you are in a long-term pattern of change and that you must surrender your normal Capricornian resistance to upheaval. Those of you who have not learnt this simple lesson must do so now if you are to make the most of your extraordinary opportunities for growth. 
AQUARIUS, The fact that this month's major Sun-Moon alignments are profoundly practical - in the sense that it actually encourages you to get things done - can only do you good. All aspects of your life, including your intimate personal relationships, will benefit. 
ARIES, Physical passions are raised, financial fears are stirred, and you may wonder just what you are supposed to do. One way out of an impasse is to be thoroughly saintly and hang on to spiritual truths - without being pompous, of course! When you begin to see the world through different eyes then all those old problems may just disappear. 
TAURUS, Lock horns with other people if you must, but realise that there are a number of escape routes. Legal guarantees could give satisfaction, for example, as could some sort of journey or long-distance adventure. You should stick to a high moral tone, though. 
GEMINI, A spot of hard work never did anyone any harm, and seeing as it looks as if partners' interests must come first, it may be that you have to provide valuable support to others. You may even be out rattling the collection tin! But you've got to give people a very good reason as to why they should support you. 
CANCER, It's all too easy to look on the gloomy side and magnify your problems, but if you cultivate such qualities as enthusiasm and optimism, and then go all out to pamper yourself, you will lift your spirits and do yourself a power of good. By the way, you can also expect news from afar at any moment. 
LEO, You must maintain the delicate balance between home and work, between your interests and others', and between private needs and public duty. This is not the easiest of tasks and a fair amount of self-discipline is required if you are to curb your instincts. 
VIRGO, If there's a problem in your romantic life it's that your aspirations are too high. You dream of the purest, most noble love, but you're in danger of losing touch with reality! Counter this influence by trying to understand what partners need and want. 
LIBRA, There are emotional complications aplenty, and you may be slightly uncertain about the future, but what stands out in your chart now is the need to deal properly with large domestic purchases and family finances. Plus, someone who you always thought was a rival might soon become a generous supporter. 
SCORPIO, This is one of the most important days of the year for you, and even if the skies don't open today, and the earth doesn't shake, a whole raft of desires and activities will reach a turning point, taking you through to the rest of the year with a much deeper sense of your destiny and purpose. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you are overworked, under-rewarded and thoroughly confused, then you are exactly in tune with today's powerful planetary aspects. Out of such feelings should come the resolve to make drastic improvements, and the determination never to repeat old mistakes. 
CAPRICORN, Social influences are volatile, and while you may meet people who seem at first to be soul-mates, there is a chance that your mood could swing from one extreme to another. You should take responsibility for your own feelings - and never pin the blame on innocent people. 
AQUARIUS, It's doubtful that you'll have much time off. When leisure activities are scheduled, you should compete to the full, aiming to win, even if it's only a question of surpassing your own past best. You'll be coming up with unusual ideas, but your task is to put them into practice - otherwise you might just be wasting your time. 
ARIES, It's time for a spot of shopping, especially if you're spending other people's money! It's actually an important moment to choose between financial security and a venture which could be a risk. But don't be hasty, for there might still be further details waiting to come to light. 
TAURUS, A partner has as much will-power as you, if not more. So, if you should feel inclined to enter into a trial of strength you will have to realise that, however well you have done so far, you could risk everything you have gained. A few simple safe-guards should do the trick. 
GEMINI, Don't expect to be let off the hook today, or tomorrow for that matter. Do yourself a favour and put rumours and suspicions to one side, concentrating on the here and now, and what you can do to improve the world for everyone. You can only gain if people see you putting others first. 
CANCER, Children and younger relations demand extra time, but you may have difficulty keeping all the emotional balls in the air at the same moment, especially if friends also require your support and sustenance. You might have to make some difficult choices - and soon. 
LEO, You've got some bright financial ideas, so with the right advice you could do very well indeed. The one thing you must realise is that partners are essential to the fulfilment of your plans. Plus, don't take risks with your emotional security or throw away goodwill just when you need it most. 
VIRGO, You may now be tempted to join in the fray, but before you dabble in partners' disputes and arguments between colleagues, be warned that you may have to take some flak of your own. However, if others are honest, they'll admit to benefiting from your breadth of vision. 
LIBRA, It's not what you want that matters, but what you can afford. Face up to those hard questions, like what you're working for, what's it all worth, and are you being paid enough? If the answer to the last is ‘no', do something about it! There are many ways to increase your income and cut your spending. 
SCORPIO, You may well imagine that you were completely right about the past and are utterly correct about the future. Confidence is one thing, a complete lack of self-doubt is another, and it could be useful now to question your emotional priorities. You don't want to blunder into a brick-wall! 
SAGITTARIUS, About the only thing you can do is be as philanthropic and charitable as you can - and provide a valuable back-up for other people. Put unstinting effort into improving the quality of life for partners, and you'll avoid certain pitfalls arising out of your past actions. 
CAPRICORN, Children or younger relations should take pride of place in family matters. For your own benefit you should take a leaf out of their book and resolve to be still more youthful and young at heart in the future. After all, you're as young as you feel - in theory! 
AQUARIUS, A professional battle is about to be joined. Even for those of you not at work, a long-term ambition is now coming to a turning-point, and you will have to decide whether to opt out or re-double your efforts. A community project will soon pay dividends. 
ARIES, Your romantic life is beginning to look rather more expensive. There is no better way to someone's heart than a generous gesture, perhaps a little present here and there as a token of your love. You never know - a partner might reveal hidden depths. 
TAURUS, You must keep a firm focus on down-to-earth and routine activities, and realise that the more trivial or downright boring tasks you complete now, the better you'll be able to cope with a coming emotional whirlwind. Keep both feet on the ground - at the same time! 
GEMINI, Consider the pleasurable aspects of today's tasks, chores and jobs. The ancient  sages teach us that any activity can be fulfilling if tackled with the right attitude, and this is a lesson which you may now take to heart. Besides, perhaps the biggest ambitions are not the best ones. 
CANCER, Take domestic responsibilities seriously today. In spite of the fact that what really seems to be important are friendships and duties outside the home, you don't want family arrangements to slip out of your control. Perhaps a close friend can help you choose between irreconcilable options. 
LEO, When powerful planets move across your chart they oblige you to face the reality of change. You may prepare for such pressures by sharing your hopes and fears and encouraging loved ones to reveal their innermost feelings. I hope you're not too surprised by what you hear. 
VIRGO, Financial considerations are now impinging on your thoughts and feelings, although whether major developments are in hand is questionable. You may do yourself a favour and keep an eye open for bargains, with down-to-earth necessities preferable to wild luxuries - but only just! 
LIBRA, The financial situation should now be clear, but within a few days you'll realise that the only thing you can rely on is uncertainty. Make a point of listening to the experts, even to partners who may never have spoken a single word of sense in their lives! 
SCORPIO, You are going to have to take a great deal more responsibility than you ever wanted before very much longer. Today, though, your main task is to keep a grip on changeable emotions, and realise that your feelings may relate more to the past than the present. 
SAGITTARIUS, Spend a great deal of energy trying to work out what makes other people tick. The fact is that your doubts concerning someone's intentions or behaviour may be spot-on, but it's not yet clear what you should do about it. With any luck the problem will have passed on by the time you have to make a final choice. 
CAPRICORN, You must keep the legal situation in view, and see to it that you are always aware of your rights. Also, you may lend whatever support is required to a close companion or relation who is struggling in an educational or adventurous project. Good communication is the key to sure-fire success. 
AQUARIUS, It is terribly easy to get swept along by self-interest, and to blame other people for standing in your way. However, if ever there was a time to take a saintly attitude and realise that you can't live by bread alone, this is it! It's your value system which counts. 
ARIES, You really don't have any choice but to listen to partners. Compromise will be the greatest commodity around, and a tactical retreat in the short-term will help you win the battle in the long run. Besides, if you make suggestions to other people, they might expect you to put them into practice. 
TAURUS, You still have a great deal of emotional power, which of course means that you also have a responsibility towards others. It is much easier than you imagine to manipulate their feelings, even unintentionally. That's why you should be careful about what you say! 
GEMINI, You are all too prone to worries which have no basis in fact whatsoever. You may also imagine that someone is out to do you down, but realise that first thoughts, like first impressions, can often be misleading. This is no time to jump to rash conclusions. 
CANCER, The emotional temperature is rising. The more directed and focused you are, and the clearer your ambitions, the better off you'll be. If you are currently stumbling around in the dark, come back to reality immediately and set yourself some realistic targets. 
LEO, It's a useful day to put forward unlikely suggestions, especially if you've set your heart on a new job or promotion. There's also an increasing likelihood that you'll be taken away from home or from your usual base. Still, it might do you good to get out and about. 
VIRGO, Amid all the hurly-burly of daily life, it's very important to pay a little extra attention to the ethical issues and moral questions. You should take the lead in enforcing higher standards not by preaching, but by setting a worthy example. Other people should do as you do, not just as you say! 
LIBRA, A little extra confidence will come in handy today, especially if it's time to put your foot down at home. You have put up with other people's irritating whims and foibles for far too long, but please don't sink to their level. Try to show them where they've gone wrong - with sympathy and understanding, of course. 
SCORPIO, When all is said and done you can only do so much, and other people must recognise that even if you bend over backwards to help, it might still not do them any good. So, concentrate on what you think is important, and try to make partners see that you're not letting them down. 
SAGITTARIUS, Stay busy and recognise that collaboration is essential at work. You will have to carry colleagues with you if you are to get your own way, and if you go it alone then your options may be narrowed down. And don't worry that you're being undermined. If you do things right then you can't be touched. 
CAPRICORN, Your travel stars are now extraordinarily imaginative, and getting more so by the day. In one sense this means that you should focus on adventurous plans, but also bear in mind that contacts should be forged with loved ones, friends and acquaintances overseas. 
AQUARIUS, Take a step back and consider all personal matters from the long-term perspective. There are broader patterns in your life, and it is only by understanding these that you will figure out current strains. It may even be that a dose of stress is good for you. 
ARIES, It should be a morning for hard work, but by the afternoon, partnership and matrimonial affairs will be rising up the scale of importance. There's a financial time-bomb ticking away, and this is where help will soon be needed. Start by balancing the books. 
TAURUS, Your greatest quality right now is your poetic charm. If you are tempted in any way to go for revenge, please realise that there is a great deal of water to flow under the bridge before you truly understand what other people have done. Bide your time for a little while longer. 
GEMINI, Take things one step at a time today, accepting the old truth that houses built on firm foundations last so much longer than those built on sand. Don't be distracted by rumours and half-truths. Mercury's mixed relationships suggest that it's all a matter of getting the facts straight. 
CANCER, This is an excellent moment for all who are making suggestions, putting forward proposals and attending interviews. Your point of view should be more balanced than others', but you'll retain your characteristic enthusiasm and ability to inspire reluctant partners. 
LEO, Tie up all financial loose ends today, even if it's only a question of deciding whether one minor purchase is a better buy than another. If you clear up such trivial cares now, you'll have time for rather more important matters in a few days' time. 
VIRGO, Travel and adventurous plans should be given a high priority if you are willing to benefit from this week's passing opportunities. The fact is that you need a shot of excitement if you are to make the most of your current potential, and you will begin to resent any unfair constraints on your freedom. 
LIBRA, Spend a little time by yourself, mulling over the past and plotting the future. Understand that day-dreams are a very useful way of processing unconscious feelings and moving towards a position where your visions of the future become reality. 
SCORPIO, As the hours pass, the chances of a fresh mystery become stronger. It may be a matter of a lost possession or a missed appointment, but the positive side for you in all this is that you may be able to duck out of a particular commitment. You never know - other people might be as relieved as you are! 
SAGITTARIUS, You may spend a little time considering your own professional and worldly ambitions, but as the day goes on, you will have to consider partners' interests as well. Give yourself over to social pleasures later on and remember - there's nothing wrong with a little escapism! 
CAPRICORN, When it comes to love, you will be struggling to free yourself from pressures imposed by family, society and other external forces. Find a way to reconcile your own desires with what is expected of you. It may be that you can please other people and get your way. 
AQUARIUS, Take the opportunity to check up on all finances, especially joint commitments and connections with other people. This looks like an ideal time to accept new domestic duties, but also to settle any outstanding debts. Oh, and the time is coming when you'll be able to tell someone else how you feel about them. 
ARIES, You're still in a stronger position than many people, even if it doesn't feel like it, and should therefore survive any mini-crises this week, including the occasional financial wobble. Your best qualities are your determination and refusal to give in to obstacles. 
TAURUS, Other people often seem reluctant to tell you the whole story. Mind you, if you don't know what's going on you'll be less vulnerable to bouts of gossip and back-stabbing over the coming week. In fact, you should be in a fairly secure position, able to talk your way out of almost any corner, however tight! 
GEMINI, By all accounts you are about to become even more secretive than ever. Just why this should be so is not exactly clear, but it could be that other people are not yet able to understand your version of the facts. Perhaps you should try to explain yourself better! 
CANCER, You may resolve to be still more sociable, and relish that growing confidence which enables you to provide entertainment and pleasure for other people. Keep an eye on the main chance, but realise that if you go your own way, you might lose valuable support. But, then, you'll also free yourself from people who have been holding you back! 
LEO, All eyes must be on worldly ambitions, including professional aspirations, but also community responsibilities. You'll gain great satisfaction out of seeing other people do well from your efforts. You might even be able to talk your way to the top with an emphasis on style and appearance, leaving the real substance and content until later. 
VIRGO, Your stars are beginning to look quite extraordinarily adventurous, and you may be about to break out of an emotional straight-jacket and try something new. Listen well to partners' advice, for even if they sound muddled at first, there's some good common sense in amongst the vague promises. 
LIBRA, There are signs that partners could be becoming increasingly irascible, but never fear. Such bouts of irritation will have their turn, but will pass, and whoever gives you a hard time over the coming few days could end up feeling rather shamefaced. 
SCORPIO, You can afford to relax a little. However, as long as planetary tensions are maintained, you could come under intense emotional pressure to reform your domestic arrangements. Someone you've known for rather a long time could come up with a stunning proposal at any moment. 
SAGITTARIUS, The most lively planetary patterns occur in regions of your horoscope slightly detached from your own priorities. You may therefore begin to imagine that the grass is greener on the other side, but by the same token you are also avoiding troubles that are afflicting other people. 
CAPRICORN, Creative influences are astounding, which is obviously excellent for all who move in artistic fields. The pay-off for everyone born under your sign should be steadily rising romantic passions, so almost anything could happen in the emotional department! 
AQUARIUS, Your family situation is now looking increasingly changeable. Other people should be allowed the maximum freedom to manoeuvre, while you in your turn must have the courage of your convictions. You never know - you might reach an agreement that suits everyone. 
ARIES, What an amazing time this is! Ethical and moral ideals seem to be uppermost, but you're in an impatient mood and such lofty considerations may be swept to one side. If romance is on your mind, you may be ready to make others aware of how you feel before it's too late. 
TAURUS, You're much sharper with money than many people imagine. You'll come close to carrying off the financial coup of the century, such is your eye for a bargain. But, if you put one foot an inch out of place, then your profit may be turned into a loss. 
GEMINI, Partners, loved ones, spouses, colleagues, rivals, people you like and people you don't, all have one thing in common. None of them can make up their minds or decide where they stand. However, you may force the pace after the middle of the week - and insist that they come off the fence. 
CANCER, Work, health and practical matters are highlighted, although it's uncertain whether you'll be pushing yourself to the limit or be flat on your back, worn out and exhausted. Emotionally, you are bound to feel continued benefits from Venus' helpful passage through influential parts of your chart. 
LEO, You can turn on the charm and sweep people off their feet. The way to deal with even recalcitrant children is to show them how to have fun. Family meetings may have a deeper meaning but, in general, it's a time for pleasure. Home decoration is important to you - so spread a splash of colour around. 
VIRGO, Astrology may be all about freedom of choice, but some changes are inevitable. The point is, though, that you can determine the exact shape and direction that they take. You may be unable to control events at home, so why not just let life take its own sweet course? 
LIBRA, It's surprising just how stimulating money can be once you dream up new ways to earn more. On the whole, though, this is a time for spending. What's more, you should surround yourself with colour and luxury - you deserve it. It's likely that charitable activities should now be taking up more of your time. 
SCORPIO, Sometimes reality is a very difficult thing and it's not surprising that you often try to sweep difficulties under the carpet. Now, however, friends and lovers are willing to give you a second hearing. They will be as ready as you are to forgive and forget. 
SAGITTARIUS, In many ways you are an utterly admirable individual. As usual, you're acting out of the very best of motives and your natural kindness is well to the fore. But give yourself all the time you need to prevaricate and change your opinions. Plus, it seems that there is passion around every corner. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon gets you off to a flying start by bathing you in beneficial lunar alignments. Deal with monetary matters on Wednesday and save family gatherings for the weekend. Those three mystical planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have helped in the past, and they'll be offering yet more assistance now. 
AQUARIUS, Somebody who seemed to have a great deal of promise may now be seen in their true colours. Yet the fact is that the reality may be closer to your dreams than the mirage which once fascinated you. At work it is who you know, rather than what you know that counts. 
ARIES, This could be a turbulent day, and cash and career issues will disturb your weekend peace. A touch of competition will add spice to routine activities, and you' be advised to follow up new ideas without delay. Don't let the fact that you're a little over-emotional blind you to just how much is going your way. 
TAURUS, A powerful planetary alignment makes for an exciting day, but please try to strike a balance between promoting your own interests and looking after friends' affairs. This is no time to give in to mindless aggression - especially as soon as you lose your temper you'll be begging for forgiveness! 
GEMINI, Dynamic planetary aspects can be turned to your advantage, so leave nothing to chance. If you have been held up by opposition from colleagues, there may be ways in which you can turn the tables on them. In fact, I suspect that you'll be able to make up for the slights and insults of years! 
CANCER, There's a lot of tension in the air and family members and friends may be in a fighting mood. It's up to you to turn friction to everybody's advantage by suggesting positive alternatives. It's all to do with the Moon's challenging alignment, so it will pass very soon. 
LEO, Stormy planetary influences could be useful if they help you clear the air. However, if you do have something to get off your chest, make sure your feelings are pointed in the right direction. Otherwise you'll sound off at the wrong people and sow the seeds for problems some way down the line. 
VIRGO, There'll be plenty of scope for your diplomatic and healing powers today, largely because friends and colleagues will be falling out with each other. Relatives will seek your support, but don't get sucked into personal disputes. Try to get people to see that public good is better than private greed. 
LIBRA, Your peaceful mood will not square with combative circumstances. Other people will be putting you on the spot, challenging you to come up with the goods. Relations may be on your side, though they may not necessarily be any help. But at least they'll listen! 
SCORPIO, Energetic friends and associates rely on you for your steady qualities, but you're unlikely to be much use today. You'll be far too preoccupied with your own problems and ambitions to spare time for other people. But, then, they're too busy with their own ideas to worry! 
SAGITTARIUS, It's an energetic day, celestially speaking. Nothing turns out as planned, but delays and sudden obstacles may be blessings in disguise if they divert you from a problematic and highly risky course of action. The time has come to reconsider your progress in all directions. 
CAPRICORN, There has been an interesting tie-up recently between personal and public aspirations on the one hand and business prospects and social life, on the other. You should seriously consider a range of options in all fields. The reason that there's no need to rush into final choices now is that circumstances are about to shift markedly. 
AQUARIUS, There's plenty of scope to indulge your dramatic characteristics and qualities and, the more enterprising you are, the greater will be the prospects of success. Do not be disturbed if partners are in an angry mood - just let them get over it. 
ARIES, The focus is shifting towards financial affairs, in particular to the need to balance income and expenditure - not an easy task. Domestic repairs, maintenance and improvements of all sorts will be necessary, although partners must be in agreement. 
TAURUS, The movement of that magnetic planet Mars adds passion and vigour to turbulent aspects, and could set your imagination on fire. Follow your instincts, remembering, though, that it may be necessary to go it alone. After all, your instincts are yours - not other people's! 
GEMINI, You may fear a build-up of circumstances against you, bringing challenges and battles, possibly of a personal nature. It may be some time before the exact cause of current friction is clear. However, it could soon turn out to beconnected to younger people or children. 
CANCER, Put more energy into improving your personal relationships. You need partnerships with people with whom you are intellectually compatible, but this may require you to develop a number of interests you've ignored until now. You may be involved in a secret conversation - but even you won't know what is really being said! 
LEO, Your professional ambitions are set to receive a massive boost. However, the prospect of a large financial outlay could affect your judgment over a private or personal matter. The two are closely connected and you'll find out exactly how by the beginning of next week. 
VIRGO, You may be forced to alter certain plans before long, even those which apparently have been tightly sewn up. You must now be thankful that a close friend has shown you the newest way forward. You probably find it hard to understand just how much you have taught them over the last month. 
LIBRA, If you're honest with yourself, you'll admit that you can be devious on occasion, and that this is one such time. You may be tempted to go behind someone's back for the noblest of reasons, but you must be prepared to take the consequences - perhaps within three weeks. 
SCORPIO, This is one of those times when you must be more assertive than you've often been, or else you'll be pushed around by people who may be no tougher than you. You should have the single-minded direction to get what you want. I know you've been bogged down by detail, but not for much longer. 
SAGITTARIUS, A long period of concentration on worldly issues is coming to an end, which means of course that a new phase of life is beginning. You must allow yourself as much time as possible to focus on all personal ambitions; you have about another two weeks in all. 
CAPRICORN, After recent stress you may be ready for a holiday, but you'll be busy for some while yet. If you were to take time off now, you'd probably find you'd have little space to sit back and rest. In any case, next week's lunar alignment is likely to find you even busier. 
AQUARIUS, The pace is hotting up at home, and if you think big you'll probably achieve your aims. There seems to be scope for increased status in your community, perhaps through voluntary activities. Keep talking, though, otherwise partners will lose touch - and you'll lose face. 
ARIES, Business affairs, especially joint enterprises, are set to improve from now on. The fact that your ambition may be responsible for a little friction and antagonism should not put you off, or destroy an increasing mood of prosperity and well-being. 
TAURUS, The energetic planet Mars is now assuming a dominant influence in your life, partly because it is about to signify a pronounced shift in your circumstances - and you'll be on top form. Few will be able to resist your dynamic charm but it's important to pace yourself and avoid pointless arguments. 
GEMINI, Travel, especially for social reasons, will be a priority, although it does seem likely that delays are inevitable. If you are experiencing a brief financial crisis this could well be the result of your lavish habits in the past. That's why it might be impossible to do more than trim costs around the edges. 
CANCER, There's always the prospect of dramatic events at home, and house buyers and sellers may expect negotiations to proceed well, even though it is unlikely that agreements will be reached just yet. Today's activities focus on romantic hopes - in the broadest, most open-minded and hopeful, sense. 
LEO, You are quite happy with your own company, although partners may find this difficult if they are relying on joint arrangements - and expecting you to turn up! Please do not let other people down, as neither you nor they will benefit from broken agreements. 
VIRGO, The question of whether career interests will benefit from current influences depends on the precise nature of your work. Activities which have a creative dimension will bring benefits, while routine tasks, however worthwhile, could fail to deliver the goods. 
LIBRA, From now on you can reasonably hope that more time will be devoted to your interests than to partners', and this could be a pleasant change. Use diplomacy, tact and  co-operation if you want to get your own way - and never give anyone the chance to suspect that you're going behind their backs. 
SCORPIO, There's long been a tie in between your social activities and your - or a partner's - professional obligations. Work will take on a new lease of life as partners and colleagues rally round to help out with your responsibilities. You must also realise that only better organisation will contribute to a healthier domestic routine. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's probably not yet the time to turn your attention to domestic improvements unless, that is, there are indications to this effect in your individual horoscope, set for your exact time of birth. Still, there's no reason why you shouldn't start laying the foundations now. 
CAPRICORN, If you are facing opposition from partners it's probably your own fault. You may feel hard-done-by but, to be perfectly blunt and honest, you are no saint, yourself. You must accept your share of the blame before relationships can genuinely be patched up. 
AQUARIUS, The accent may be on the lighter side of life, but only if you consciously put certain problems and difficulties behind you. Allow your imagination to wander and it will lead you to pastures new. But don't feel obliged to push your unusual ideas to their logical conclusion - you can back off for the next three months. 
ARIES, You are not alone in fearing, or perhaps in hoping, that social obligations will come unstuck. There is a feeling abroad that plans which were once treated as sacrosanct should now be open to question after all. Actually, you've got more important things on your mind than merely engaging in small talk. 
TAURUS, Professional ambitions seem to be going into reverse. It may be necessary for you to reconsider a number of important deals or decisions that you thought were signed and sealed. How wrong you were. Still, it is good to have a second chance - and an opportunity to duck out of a commitment. 
GEMINI, The fact that certain doubts may creep in to your beliefs is due to difficulties caused by Mercury, ruler of thought and communication.  Yet you must understand the importance of being able to question your preconceptions and priorities, even to abandon your dreams. 
CANCER, Both you and a partner are likely to feel the effects of a changing economic climate. This may not be the time to act, but it is necessary to check over all details, agreements and deals. At least you can count on a general increase in prosperity over the next seven months. 
LEO, Relationships are entering a brief frustrating phase, but you must give partners the time and space they need to come to an accommodation worked out by themselves, free from unwanted pressures. If you trust them now, then they will stick by you in the future. 
VIRGO, The last thing you want to do now is force colleagues and associates into agreements or compromises against their will. If you know what's good for you, you will allow partners to have their say. I know you think you're right. And you probably are! 
LIBRA, The prognostication for a successful outcome of domestic affairs is good, even though frustration and a feeling of being pitted against immovable objects are coming close to spoiling the atmosphere. Don't use a partner's lack of support as an excuse not to succeed - or even to have a go in the first place. 
SCORPIO, There honestly seems to be little chance of reaching an amicable agreement with relatives or people you live with. You may also be finding it difficult to make up your mind on a personal matter. The reason, though, may be that this is not yet the right time to settle outstanding questions - you need to wait until circumstances have changed. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's difficult to establish what is really happening in your chart at the moment. This is partly because it's unclear whether current events are prompted by other people or are the result, direct or indirect, of your own past behaviour and indiscretions.  
CAPRICORN, You are moving from a period which seems to have been rather depressing to one which is emotionally inspiring. However, much depends on how far your actions and aspirations are rooted in what is realistically possible. If you're still following an unfulfillable fantasy, then time is running out. 
AQUARIUS, Mercury is causing some problems. It's thrown a spanner in the works, causing a number of plans to come unstuck. One word of warning is that the effects may not be felt for months, or even years, to come. So don't attempt to finalise any personal agreement now - at least not until you've heard next week's inspiring news. 
ARIES, No doubt you are busy with professional cares and concerns, and the signs suggest that you will continue to be so for some time yet. What motivates you is a desire to be respected by your peers. It's not good enough to make demands though, you actually have to come up with the goods. 
TAURUS, As far as romance is concerned, you can expect your mood to improve now that Venus is moving into a benevolent aspect to your sign. Your feelings may be drawn towards general romantic hopes as much as to a particular person. But I have a feeling that when the bill comes, you may pay much more than is really necessary. 
GEMINI, You may be dreaming of wealth and riches, but while this is a positive period for conjuring up money-making schemes, it may not be the best time to put them into practice, at least not without expert advice. Unless, that is, you're completing a property deal. 
CANCER, For a very long time many of you have been drawn towards artistic activities. Some of you have yet to feel this pull but, when it comes, you must go along with it as otherwise you will squander your talents. It could be the best way to focus your secret spiritual and mystical energies. 
LEO, The best advice that can be offered at the moment is to be as down-to-earth as you can, given that a great many of your current planetary patterns are emanating from practical regions of your chart. The better you grasp the details at work, the closer you'll come to achieving a long-standing ambition. 
VIRGO, Current planetary influences are encouraging you to let go of reality and float off into a dream world. This is not the easiest thing to achieve but, if you've no pressing commitments, you could consider livening your life up a little. You never know - you could discover a whole new social scene. 
LIBRA, You don't need telling that it's not all plain sailing at the moment, yet it is only a matter of time before you begin to see the reward for all your wonderfully splendid selfless hard work and effort. And while you're at it, don't worry about rumours. They're just that - rumours. 
SCORPIO, The answer to social irritations lies in teamwork and genuine compromise, but don't let others take you for a ride. If the direction at work is unclear you must consider all the options as carefully as possible. You have to narrow down the choices until there are just two left. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're in a gambling mood and a small flutter won't hurt. However, if any important deals are on the stocks it's essential to seek a second opinion. The issues are too great for any one person to handle - even you! And, however enthusiastic you are, you must carry partners along with you. 
CAPRICORN, Whatever you're planning at work or at home, you must start making preparations now, that is, if you haven't done so already. As soon as you begin any new venture, unexpected complications will inevitably surface. But you'll turn the tables in about ten days. 
AQUARIUS, The Moon's position is benevolent, so make use of your abundant advantages. Start early if you want to get the best out of inspired plans and proposals. Be aware, though, that people around you could be in a touchy mood, and that a chance remark might trigger an argument. 
ARIES, Why do you rush around so much? You will probably find that you may get as much done if you slowed down a little, especially now that the planets as a whole are in a relaxed mood. The trouble now is that Mars, your planetary ruler, is tending to make you obsessed with detail. But try putting your feet up for a change. 
TAURUS, Why, you may wonder, do you have to spend so much time explaining all the pros and cons to people who never seem to listen? Perhaps it's because Mercury is currently in such a dastardly and mischievous relationship with your sign. Or, maybe, it's just that you expect too much of other people! 
GEMINI, You know what they say - you can't live by bread alone. You can do no better than to sacrifice your own interests and help other people out for a change. Hopefully associates will now concede that you are indeed a caring and generous person. And about time too! 
CANCER, For some time now you seem to have encountered a series of setbacks and disappointments. Yet, with any luck, recent efforts are at long last beginning to bear fruit. Never fear - the end is in sight. There's one other factor to consider, and that's the extent to which you worry about nothing! 
LEO, Your planets are benevolent, but you can't always stay positive. On the other hand, please do remember that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how fed up you become with your burdens and obligations. Don't be too proud to ask for help and assistance. It could be given much more willingly than you expect. 
VIRGO, Just because affairs in a number of areas are going so well, that is no cause for complacency. You are indeed at a turning-point, one from which you can be sure that all your interests will benefit. Passions are rising, so keep a steady nerve and stay cool. 
LIBRA, You seem to fall apart when your emotional life becomes too complicated, and this, it must be said, is a problem you will have to learn to face up to. The fact that domestic pressures may be all too real doesn't excuse you. But then you are also tending to turn small molehills into major mountains at the moment. 
SCORPIO, You'll face awkward issues head-on this week, and you won't be afraid to put forward your own ideas with clarity and vigour. You deserve to be heard, all the more so because they are so incredibly fascinating. If you're not getting your point across, put yourself in a partner's place and see how it feels. 
SAGITTARIUS, Seldom have you experienced such a potentially decisive period in matters relating not only to money but also to the ways in which you value yourself. If you believe in your own talents then material reward will follow. You will also share in a partner's good fortune at some time over the next ten days. 
CAPRICORN, A plethora of planets influencing your sign is a reasonable explanation for why you are under so much pressure. Why not accept that the present period is hardly relaxed and use your time to launch the next phase of your life? By the way, children have some of the best ideas at the moment, so listen well. 
AQUARIUS, There are almost certain to be major confrontations this week, but they could be behind the scenes and very few people will be aware that anything has gone amiss. Stick to the facts where possible, especially when talking to relations; they are unlikely to accept vague explanations. 
ARIES, The general tone of the planets this week is optimistic, if sometimes argumentative, and there's absolutely no point in being down in the dumps. One piece of useful advice is to start getting fit now - if you're not already, that is! Romantic conditions continue to be favourable, though you seem to be just a little secretive. 
TAURUS, Venus is now sparkling away in a distant but vital part of your chart, emphasising the role that close personal relationships have to play in all aspects of your life. Love and appreciation are vital to your well-being. How pleasant it must be to realise that the stars are smiling on you. Indeed, you may even lose yourself in your feelings. 
GEMINI, There are strong indications that you'll be hearing from loved ones overseas before long. Those of you who are unattached and planning an unscheduled break could be in for a surprise romance. The Sun's tough alignments will stiffen your resolve and a new friend could encourage you to pursue an ambition to the bitter end. 
CANCER, The planets continue to pry and probe into your innermost secrets. However, the general tenor of life is now more relaxed and assured and you'll soon be ready for anything. Foreign climes beckon, and a distant possibility could become a firm path to personal or professional happiness. 
LEO, Leo is a sign with a reputation for being self-interested. There's nothing wrong in having a healthy ego, but over the next few weeks you may have to put your own feelings and interests in second place. Optimism is one of your strong points this week. It's also a fine time for determination and confidence. 
VIRGO, Mercury is rapidly approaching a new alignment with the Sun, but their meeting will not happen this week. This means that you have a little time left to consider your options before committing yourself to a special partnership. This is a perfect time to raise your sights to higher things. 
LIBRA, Although some of you are rushed off your feet, you should realise that domestic chores and family responsibilities can be made enjoyable. All that is required is a gentle shift of attitude. Realise that financial matters are about to improve, and plan accordingly. 
SCORPIO, The entry of a single planet, Venus, into new sectors of your solar chart, is all that is required to bring a friendly gloss to your family relationships. Indeed, a spot of domestic entertaining would not come amiss. Close friends will share in your happiness towards the end of the week. 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus is a powerful influence for good, offering you support if you're arranging meetings, holding discussions or about to attend an interview. You'll have no trouble persuading people that you are right. All Sagittarians are now in an excellent position to do well, although you may need just one more push. 
CAPRICORN, This is a profitable period, one when the way forward financially is to team up with other people. You may have an idea that you can make some money which requires expert advice or, perhaps, an extra pair of hands. On the whole, this is a satisfactory week, one in which to make the most of yourself. 
AQUARIUS, Venus is a magical influence, bringing self-confidence and social assurance. You are right to expect your fair share of love and affection but should remember that it is often nobler to give than to receive. Your best single day could be Thursday, when, for once, people will accept your bright ideas. 
ARIES, Your priority now ought to be to apply a new broom to social affairs and also to anything at work that requires collaboration. There is still precious little that you can do to settle a financial question but, then, is it really important? Perhaps it's not as pressing as people think. 
TAURUS, Over the next few days disturbing planetary aspects will fade, allowing you to bring personal relationships back to earth. Partners still have a few tricks left, but it should all be water off a duck's back to you. By which I mean that you shouldn't really worry about trivial problems and minor insults. 
GEMINI, If you grumble or complain about working conditions, or about colleagues' behaviour, you will do no more than waste your time. Every precious moment should be spent completing your own tasks and achieving your personal ambitions. And then there's your private life to think about! 
CANCER, What you experience now could bring the culmination of a long series of disputes, and you may do your bit by pointing out the ethical dimension. In other words, what is right is right for all, not just for a few selfish individuals. The only problem is in getting everyone to agree. 
LEO, At least everything is now open and above board. There can be few people who do not have at least some idea of what has been going on, and probably everyone has an opinion as to what should be done. You can always slip away and let them slug it out! 
VIRGO, You have every right to be full of yourself, but remember one thing today: you really must give partners a fair hearing. It's not just a question of listening - you should actually hear and understand what their wise words really mean. And if there's anything that's not clear, ask them to say it again!  
LIBRA, For the fourth day running everything hangs on money. Questions like what you can afford, or indeed, what you should buy, will dominate your actions. The fact that such issues are so emotionally-loaded makes the answers rather difficult and somewhat elusive. 
SCORPIO, What you learn or discover in a strange or totally unexpected way will enable you to settle quite a number of scores. You must concentrate on improvements in relationships with children and younger relations for, as you know well enough, the future lies with them.  
SAGITTARIUS, What really matters is that after all the emotional dramas and upsets, you will realise the importance of putting home and family happiness above all else. You may still, though, be troubled by secret worries. Perhaps it's time to talk to someone you can trust. 
CAPRICORN, Partners may be less uptight and more willing to listen today. Teamwork, social and group activities seem to be incredibly competitive at the moment, with people increasingly divided into winners and losers. Yet it's not coming top that matters, but doing your best. 
AQUARIUS, You will soon decide to bring one cycle to a close and finally sever costly ties. The important consideration at work is to acquire responsibilities which enable you to serve your community, to feel that you're doing your best for the whole planet. 
ARIES, Social pressures still seem to be very intense and the associated costs may rise. In fact, differences over money could be a source of friction between friends, and an avoidable one at that. Hopefully, tension will drop this evening, permitting brief relaxation. 
TAURUS, Words that have been left unsaid for far too long can be ignored no longer. You can now gain a great deal from making fresh proposals and taking on additional responsibilities. What you need is respect, and with the right moves that's precisely what you'll get. 
GEMINI, Look far afield for inspiration and don't waste any time. Other people have much to offer, but the ultimate inspiration should come from you and you alone. This means that you really don't need to accept any advice that doesn't suit you. Just make sure you have a good explanation ready. 
CANCER, Financial risks should be avoided, partly because there is a great deal yet to be explained. In relationships, you must pay some attention to your physical needs and well-being. In love, passions are still running high, and there'll be moments when you're walking an emotional tightrope. 
LEO, Keep your options open and do everything in your power to ease existing tensions in close, personal relationships. Do try to be constructive, and attempt to free yourself from faded romantic memories. And, one other thing - tell someone close how you really feel about them. 
VIRGO, Although it may not meet all your needs or expectations, an agreement made now should prove lasting and durable. Your best move is almost certainly to anticipate every single little thing that could go wrong, and make sure that such problems are accounted for. 
LIBRA, You are now in danger of creating a completely wrong and inaccurate impression, perhaps because you don't value yourself, or a particular relationship, as highly as you should. Be kind to lovers who don't see the world in the way you do. Oh, and listen to older relations. They may have the best advice! 
SCORPIO, The world still looks tense, but it's very difficult to see exactly where celestial lightning will strike next. There seems to be a tiny emotional matter outstanding, so deal with it before it takes on a life of its own. Plus, keep away from troublesome, time-wasting types. 
SAGITTARIUS, Rumours and suspicions are rife, but you've got to distinguish between fact and fantasy. Don't fall into the trap of imagining that other people are out to undermine you. And, for your part, stamp on all unjust and unfair suggestions before they go any further. 
CAPRICORN, On no account allow friends to steal your thunder. The fact is that financial matters, from major transactions to small purchases, may go wrong. The simple remedy is to take everything at the right pace, and see that you are fully insured and up-to-date with the latest figures. 
AQUARIUS, It is impossible to see who will start arguments or cause friction today, although professional Aquarians do seem to be most at risk. Bend over backwards to give other people the benefit of the doubt. What's more, people you live with will see that you're ready to compromise on a personal matter. 
ARIES, The Sun and Pluto have teamed up in a rather splendid alignment, but if you think that you can sit around while financial matters sort themselves out, you are making a big mistake. Don't take risks, and don't toy with someone else's emotions. 
TAURUS, Partners really must be taken seriously if you are not to blunder into something rather more than you bargained for. Never make the cardinal error of belittling any friend, colleague or associate, especially if you happen to be in their debt! 
GEMINI, One area of your chart which deserves mention today represents your physical well-being. It looks as if emotional tension could leave you feeling worn out, but sensible, organised relaxation will go a long way to help. Pamper yourself! 
CANCER, Tomorrow's stars raise the prospect of wild and costly financial risks. The reason this needs to be mentioned today is so that you can resist any seductive blandishments or offers coming your way over the next twenty-four hours - at least until you're aware of the hidden pitfalls. 
LEO, A very powerful theme in your solar chart concerns a possible move of home or equivalent domestic upheaval. The best way to retain control is to set the pace at every turn. Once you start reacting to events after they happen, you will quickly lose your way. 
VIRGO, There's a possible problem at work, perhaps involving a misunderstanding and almost certainly connected to a person of intense passions. Somebody you're involved with will also make a demand for total truth and commitment. Be careful, and say only what you mean. 
LIBRA, There is a sense in which you keep coming back to the same financial problems and worries, just like a cracked record. Yet rather than dwelling on hopes, fears and other illusions, you may actually do something about it. All you need is sufficient determination. 
SCORPIO, It so happens that today's planetary picture offers you the chance to triumph once and for all. You could even be propelled headlong into a remarkable twelve-month period of optimism and opportunity. Any way in which you can put your cares behind you will be well worth the effort. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mercury represents your brilliant thoughts and best ideas, and its current helpful presence reveals your ability to control everyone and everything set up in opposition to you. You may be able to banish rivals with no more than a few well-chosen words. 
CAPRICORN, Business pressures are mild today, but liable to blow up before much longer. In general I'd advise caution but, in specific situations, you must use your own judgment. It may be better to make plans in secret, away from others' intrusive gaze. That way you'll avoid unnecessary criticism. 
AQUARIUS, Little by little life is moving your way, and you may assert your independence and stand up for your rights. However, authority figures, from employers to the law, are liable to be swept by intense emotions at unpredictable moments, so watch out! 
ARIES, No Arien has any excuse to be anything other than completely businesslike today. The fact is that most planetary patterns are stirring up chaos, and unless you keep your feet firmly on the ground, events will take on a dynamic of their own. Hang on tight! 
TAURUS, Be content with whatever is going well and looking fortunate. The last thing to do now is challenge partners on their own ground, as you will almost certainly stir up a hornets' nest of resentment and frustration. You'll probably spend more energy than you need keeping other people sweet. 
GEMINI, There's an intensity in the air, and a brooding, emotional cloud is looming on the horizon. You should be sheltered from the worst, but must take care at work - and in every single activity that you have come to take for granted. Complacency can be your biggest weakness. 
CANCER, According to every current indication, passion is still increasing: you are likely to be gripped by sudden enthusiasm one moment, but find yourself down in the dumps the next. The way to cheer yourself up is to always look on the bright side. After all, every cloud has a silver lining. 
LEO, If you imagine that you can achieve what you want personally or professionally and still gloss over fundamental questions, you are sadly mistaken. Banana skins lie in wait for all those who fail to deal with difficult questions. A little extra effort now, should prevent a major headache down the road. 
VIRGO, Planets which indicate a maximum chance for arguments also offer an unparalleled opportunity to get to the truth. Don't shy away from facts, or even theories, which challenge your current preconceptions. And don't let family members pull the wool over your eyes. 
LIBRA, Venus, planet of love and affection, is a great help. After all, this great celestial body doubles both as the planet of friendship and as your personal ruler. You'll need a lot of goodwill to get through to family members, though. Hopefully they'll see the light before much longer. 
SCORPIO, The general planetary situation is tough, uncompromising and ruthless. It is a serious question as to whether you will be pushing yourself to the limit or making unreasonable demands on other people. However, one particular difficulty may actually turn out to be a major benefit. 
SAGITTARIUS, Suspicions and doubts may easily be dealt with through a little careful thought. There is almost no branch of human activity which will not benefit from a little of your famous commonsense. But will other people listen? Probably not - but that's their problem! 
CAPRICORN, Venus, planet of love, is now challenging Mars, planet of energy and aggression. A bout of personal friction will show you the way out of a current dilemma, so pin people down with formal commitments and undertakings. And try to get any agreements in writing! 
AQUARIUS, Any minute now, full-scale war is likely to break out at work. Do yourself a favour and keep your head down unless, that is, you know that you can win. For your part, you must be able to exercise authority wisely. It's all a matter of setting a sensible example. 
ARIES, No Monday morning moans, please. Jupiter's generous and optimistic relationship over your houses of work and creativity is reinforced by Uranus' generally surprising movements. The long-term prospects for you, and for partners, are therefore excellent. 
TAURUS, Nothing is absolutely black or white, and an ethical or moral question may be raised very soon. It is not necessary to sacrifice your interests; neither should you expect anyone else to do so. Overseas travel may beckon, but you may be content to dream. 
GEMINI, Every year at around this time Mercury, your planetary ruler and hence a natural ally, swings into a dramatic relationship to your sign. In fact, I think you'll start to sit up and take notice of everything that you've spent the last eleven months ignoring! 
CANCER, Sometimes it's impossible to figure out what makes people tick, and it is difficult to gauge whether partners will be totally confused, or utterly inspired. Probably this is something you can only assess for yourself, although you should avoid hasty judgments. 
LEO, The Moon is making waves in areas of your chart concerned with work, so you should have few difficulties tackling the real world. Romantic considerations may have to take second place, just for now. Mind you, there's always time to tell someone how you feel about them. 
VIRGO, Business, work and pleasure combine, by virtue of the Moon's sensible presence. Yet you must be aware that behind every simple statement lies a hidden and complicated meaning, and other people may be chronically incapable of saying what they think. 
LIBRA, A succession of helpful, harmonious planetary alignments could set you up for some very prosperous financial decisions. At the very least you should keep a sharp eye open for rare bargains. Your attitude to cash, though, is shaped by deep emotional forces. 
SCORPIO, The Sun is creating friction in a number of areas of your chart which are intimately connected to your deepest desires. You have to remember, at times like these, that not everyone is on your wave-length. Neither will partners necessarily appreciate your sense of humour! 
SAGITTARIUS, It may be hard for friends and colleagues born under the other eleven signs to admit, but you're right! However, don't take things too far, for there are elements in the current situation which could surprise even you. The last thing you want to do is stir up feelings which are best left alone. 
CAPRICORN, You're on an emotional roller-coaster today, in a mild sort of a way. If your mood changes from hour to hour, try to make sure that your circumstances can be altered to suit. In legal matters take the longest-term view possible, and don't agree to anything without expert advice. 
AQUARIUS, Your hidden, hermit-like qualities may make an appearance today, and I doubt if you will welcome friends who try to be over-familiar. Anyone who tries to extract your secrets should be shown the door. I'm sure there's a very good reason for your privacy! 
ARIES, Venus, planet of love, is shifting its position. And that's a fair enough indication that working relationships will become increasingly important. You know that efficiency is of the essence, and that there is absolutely no excuse for letting down people who have come to rely on you. And for some good news, Mercury will help you make the right decisions. 
TAURUS, Continue with your plans, dealing with difficulties as they arise. Keep an eye on Venus, if you wish to discover more about your romantic possibilities. This wonderful planet's residency in an intense region of your chart is the most perfect indication that a close relationship is destined to thrive. 
GEMINI, Romantically and emotionally you are on the up, and you must get things moving while so many decisive influences are going your way. Every aspect of your home life will benefit from your clever and delightful personality. You can see that this is a time to be positive and optimistic. 
CANCER, Mercury, the planet which represents your mind, is making it necessary for you to get all your affairs in order sooner rather than later. Hold discussions, share your ideas and arrange any important interviews. People will be open to whatever you propose, so invite partners to join you in teamwork. 
LEO, Workwise, it's still a question of following through decisions already taken and continuing with your routine. This may not be terribly exciting, but at least you are putting down firm foundations for the future, a commendable exercise which will attract admiration and respect from people in authority. 
VIRGO, Friends and colleagues - and even people you don't know so well - will be much more important to your morale than close partners, so this will be a time to mix widely and make new contacts. Remember, you never know which one of the people you meet now will be important to you in later years. 
LIBRA, Your latest lunar alignments are challenging you to make the most of your professional skills and experience, perhaps working with hopes which are still some way from realisation. Romantic trends are due to blossom around the middle of the week under the wonderful influence of Mars and Venus. 
SCORPIO, Nothing less than the best will do, and failure to live up to high standards could result in a confrontation. Your salvation lies in maintaining friendly contacts with all who are on your side, especially people with whom you have developed a romantic connection! This is no time to compromise your principles. 
SAGITTARIUS, Financial affairs are still on your mind, more so even than in past weeks and months, if that is possible. Domestic spending seems to figure highly in your plans and there is no reason why you should not push ahead with confidence. Your romantic possibilities continue to benefit from Venus' helpful presence, so that's good news. 
CAPRICORN, Thanks to Mercury's sparkling position, this looks like an excellent time to extend invitations to people with whom you have been hoping to co-operate. Obviously, social and romantic affairs will be much on your mind, but equally important will be team-work in a hobby or leisure activity. You'll achieve so much more if you seek genuine help. 
AQUARIUS, The best feature of the current astrological picture is that other people will be ready to hear what you have to say. However, there will be times when reason gives way and sheer passion rules the day. At such times, you must take a laid-back approach and compromise if need be. 
ARIES, At last, an expansion of choice is creating the need for more discussion, and you may be doing some hard thinking today. A recent muddle must be ironed out before you can afford to relax, but that might take another couple of weeks, at the minimum. 
TAURUS, The Moon offers you a significant level of emotional support today. This is a time to concentrate on what you can do to make your life more meaningful, to find ways to make your daily routine more tolerable. A business opportunity will also be revealed. 
GEMINI, It does seem almost inevitable that one way or another you will have to concede that someone else may have been right all along, galling as this may be. In any event, your planetary patterns will quickly restore your good humour, encouraging a new-found confidence. 
CANCER, Now that Venus is beginning to shed its calming rays over your intimate affairs you can afford to feel protected. yet don't be surprised if, in the process, it shows up certain corners of your life you had forgotten about or tried to ignore. Time for a romantic adventure, perhaps? 
LEO, There is only one major planetary alignment which need concern you at the moment, and that involves Mars and Mercury. These planets are perfectly poised to administer a social tonic and give your morale a general boost, just what you need at the moment. 
VIRGO, Seldom have you experienced a period which is at once so decisive yet has the potential to be so utterly confusing. Should you go or stay, begin or end a series of involvements that have become your whole life? Be patient and gradually the answers will work themselves out. 
LIBRA, Belligerent Mars is stirring up your ambitions, indicating that this is really not a restful time for you, yet neither is it beyond you to take great strides forward. Other people will arrive bearing fresh responsibilities for you, and you'll also be searching out new business opportunities for yourself. 
SCORPIO, There is a cynical side to the Scorpionic nature: what is the point, you may ask, in struggling on when so little seems to be gained? Yet with the planets rapidly assuming a profoundly benevolent relationship to your sign, there is little doubt that events are now starting to move your way. 
SAGITTARIUS, The parts of your chart linked to material prosperity are still active and your business affairs seem to be growing ever more complex. What a tangled web you weave when you try! Now you must find your way out of any confusion, and reestablish some sort of certainty. 
CAPRICORN, Whatever your day-to-day concerns, I must periodically remind you that the passage which you are now going through will be one of the most remarkable phases of your life. It is therefore necessary to make the most of everything, repeat everything, that comes your way. 
AQUARIUS, For many reasons, not least of which is a build-up of planets in personal regions of your horoscope, this is a time of year which appeals to your Aquarian spirit, yet it does seem that you are going to be busier than you would like, and much more preoccupied with routine tasks and chores than usual. 
ARIES, It is difficult to be specific about Ariens' fortunes at present. Some of you are still in a phase of considerable upheaval, others are relishing the prospect of increasing stability. If you do still have deep questions about a relationship, don't sweep them under the carpet, but don't jump to rash conclusions, either. 
TAURUS, Now that Venus is playing such a direct role in your personal choices, you have entered a period in your life when you may abandon your former secrecy. Put aside your reluctance to discuss intimate personal ambitions with people who are closely involved. In future, you must deal with the plain facts. 
GEMINI, You have good cause to hope that long-running financial questions are about to face some sort of resolution. In fact, any settlement reached now must, by definition, be temporary and but a stage on the path to the final denouement. It could all be linked to a major new ambition. 
CANCER, The planets are playing out a drama in your sign which can only be described as profoundly mythological. This means that in your partnerships both now and in the near future you will be faced with a choice of two distinct roles to play, leader or follower: will you give the orders or obey them? You'll know soon enough. 
LEO, Why is it that you are so deeply conditioned into imagining that you deserve a good, long rest? If this is what you think, you had better deal as resolutely as possible with any and every problem, however trivial, which comes up today, especially if you can throw money at them. 
VIRGO, In the past, you have often imagined that when other people came to their senses everything would be straightened out. Now you may have to face the fact that colleagues will persist in their independent ideas for a long time to come. It's all to do with the Moon, which means that you can successfully solve such problems. 
LIBRA, Everything about this time of year is symbolised by Mercury, a rich planet and one which has been responsible for making your ideas flow so vividly. Just remember that organisation and self-discipline are virtues to be cultivated if your high-minded plans are to be implemented. 
SCORPIO, Apart from the fact that this is an ideal time to travel, the astrological message is simple and straightforward. You must give free rein to the side of your nature which lives according to ideals and deeply-held beliefs, and try to establish a personal meaning to life. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is perhaps surprising to other people that you often undervalue yourself, regarding your own great gifts as of little consequence. The sooner you realise such self-effacing attitudes are nonsense, the better. Family pressures begin to build up, but your fantasies could show the way forward. 
CAPRICORN, Under one particular planetary formation you have begun to wonder if others really care about you. Yet even if they don't admit it, people genuinely do appreciate all the sacrifices you have made. They'll tell you soon, so wait for the right time for the right words to come. 
AQUARIUS, A curious aspect to Mercury indicates that there may be misunderstandings or friction over exactly who is responsible for final arrangements. My estimate is that any disputes should be quickly resolved, but it may be necessary to put your money where your mouth is! 
ARIES, Now you must pay attention to relatives and anyone you live with, otherwise problems that can easily be settled will blow up when you least expect it. Domestic friction can only be resolved by facing the facts, never by resorting to a fantasy of what might have been. 
TAURUS, The day's planets are definitely on your side, yet in a roundabout  manner. When good luck comes your way it won't be obvious, but concealed and disguised. It's up to you to stay alert for new opportunities, and to notice when close friends and colleagues present you with chances that you might once have overlooked. 
GEMINI, Mars and Venus are now exerting a special influence over your finances. Therefore, check all bills, invoices and receipts. This is just the time when carelessness could result in mistakes slipping through unnoticed, and the last thing you want is to pay out more than you need. 
CANCER, Now that Venus is softening the atmosphere, the news in general should be good, especially if partners are feeling more conciliatory. One thing to watch, though, is that in the rush to get matters arranged at home, you don't tread on people's toes. 
LEO, You should be fully in sympathy with those around you who seem intent on enjoying themselves in a thoroughly traditional manner. You are now able to appreciate Venus' soothing presence and you're increasingly engaged in a positive quest for inner peace and fulfilment. 
VIRGO, At exactly the right time, the planets have seen fit to adopt a classically sociable posture. You really must make an effort to mix as widely as possible, even if you find it difficult to push yourself forward. You're probably right to wait and see how the financial situation pans out. 
LIBRA, Professional ambitions certainly do seem to be reaching a critical stage. You may even decide it is time to read the riot act and reassert your control. Somewhere along the line, though, you may cut certain ties and restore a degree of personal independence. 
SCORPIO, Because Venus and Mercury are sitting on the dividing lines of the crucial sectors of your chart, it is frankly unclear whether you will choose to implement certain fundamental changes of plan, or merely raise them for discussion. You can soon, though, rely on improving circumstances. 
SAGITTARIUS, As personal affairs appear to be going well, this may seem to be exactly the wrong time to start worrying about financial problems and possibilities, but this is just what you will be doing over the coming days. Perhaps you have just spent more than you could afford. 
CAPRICORN, Purely as a result of cumulative pressures, you may be tempted to throw caution to the wind and push through as many changes as you think necessary. Partnerships, though, will be in a state of rapidly escalating complexity, but partly because your imagination is expanding with great speed. 
AQUARIUS, Modern astrologers talk a great deal about the 'inner world' of dreams and imagination. It is time to remind you that, with so many planets in the unconscious part of your horoscope, you ignore this mysterious realm at the expense of the quality of your entire life. 
ARIES, When we consider what you are truly capable of and what really suits you, we must say that some of your energy and activities may have been misdirected. If past attitudes no longer seem to serve you as well as they should, you must rethink certain fundamental goals. 
TAURUS, If financial affairs are still of concern, do put your own point of view across with energy and vigour, but please don't be hurt or upset if others don't share your opinions. It's right and proper that they should adopt an alternative point of view. 
GEMINI, Thanks to Mercury's continuing supportive presence, news from abroad or involving long-term goals, should at last be to your liking. As far as personal problems are concerned, seek help from friends who have been in the same situation as you in the past. 
CANCER, Being a sensitive and emotional person, you sometimes feel as if life is slipping out of your control. Yet, if you make the most of your many skills and talents, there is no reason at all why you should imagine this to be the case. By next week your lost confidence will be restored. 
LEO, Pressure for change at home may have abated, and you may feel that now is not the time to risk an open disagreement. Instead, you should take the initiative and see to it that everybody approves your positive aspirations. That's the best way to share in partners' good fortune. 
VIRGO, Although events are generally moving your way, the fact that you seem to have so many routine chores heaping up is purely due to your own failure to keep ahead in the past. Analysing the problems may be a way of avoiding taking firm practical action. 
LIBRA, The Moon, in association with other planets, reminds you that social and partnership issues still have to be dealt with in spite of recent developments. Even though this might be the last thing on your mind at present, you really do have to redouble your efforts. 
SCORPIO, Financially you have been reaping the full benefit of Jupiter's helpful patterns, marginal though this may be, and you must still be on the crest of a wave. This is an ideal note on which to enter the next phase of your existence, especially if you're hatching a creative scheme. 
SAGITTARIUS, Financial negotiations may have gone well, but it now looks as if final decisions may be altered or adjusted next week, through no fault of your own. As a general rule you should settle bills when you are prosperous rather than waiting until your resources are drained. 
CAPRICORN, Mars is still playing a powerful role in your personal relationships, so partners will be in a demanding mood, and unexpected changes of behaviour on their part will keep you on your toes. It's probably best to take a pragmatic view and lower your expectations rather than being over-critical. 
AQUARIUS, By now you should be well on the way to returning a sense of personal meaning to your affairs. Both personally fulfilling creative matters and romantic relationships should be doing well. In addition to which, your financial prospects are improving. 
ARIES, You now realise that there is no way back, even if you are at loggerheads over private and domestic matters. Relatives will eventually realise why you had to make certain decisions, even if these were unpopular. In the meantime, persuade a partner it is really worth cooperating with you. 
TAURUS, After passing through a phase in which you have put your ideas across with great vigour, you are moving towards a more conciliatory period. In future you will seduce people into agreeing with you by using your delightful, irresistible, poetic charm. 
GEMINI, This week offers your last chance to put into action a wide-ranging reassessment of your plans and interests. It looks very much as if the outcome will probably exceed your wildest expectations. But, first, you have to resolve a long-standing domestic drama. 
CANCER, Although broadly speaking you are in the right, you must be aware that partners and close friends feel they have an axe to grind and may not agree to your proposals, especially where money is concerned. The negotiations must continue, at least until next week. 
LEO, Don't feel obliged to spend too much time going over old ground, much as you might need to concentrate on establishing a firm base for current operations. But please do listen to the still, small voice of your conscience. And do seize generous gestures when they're offered. 
VIRGO, Gradually you are shifting away from a concern with the specifics of your professional ambitions towards a feeling that it is not the details which matter, but the degree to which you derive personal satisfaction from your general direction. Your real path is an inner one. 
LIBRA, There's little doubt that your underlying situation has improved in recent months. Right now your biggest flaw is over-confidence, brought on by Mars' active location. In fact, it is best to face up to your doubts instead of sweeping them under the carpet. 
SCORPIO, After a period of frenetic financial activity, it is beginning to look as if normality is about to return. But you must be cautious about such things lest you suddenly drop your guard and blunder into a bad deal. It may be another two weeks before the confusion clears. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're not normally that interested in playing emotional games or getting involved in tangled situations, mainly because you are much too busy for such time-wasting fripperies. However, you will soon have cause to take a close look at your own motives. 
CAPRICORN, Your business sense is usually fair and honest, largely thanks to the location of the diplomatic sign, Libra, in your chart, and any financial skills you've picked up have been reinforced by your good qualities. Even so, events during the next few days may make you aware of the need to organise your resources more profitably. 
AQUARIUS, At a time like this, you are subject to rapidly changing moods. Focus on domestic improvements and family relationships, but don't let other people take your decisions for you or attempt emotional blackmail, especially not where your own money is concerned. 
ARIES, At times like these it is increasingly necessary to remind you just how important are your home and family. However, if you fuss and worry too much you will ruin your own enjoyment as well as other people's. But if you're organising social get-togethers early this week, pull out the stops. 
TAURUS, The Taurean is a placid creature but, reluctant as you are to confess your real feelings, when the celestial spheres are impacting on your financial affairs, as they are today, you must make a point of being absolutely and totally honest, direct and straightforward. 
GEMINI, You were born an intellectual Gemini, so isn't it about time you started using your vivid imagination and mental abilities to the full? Get your act together, stop prevaricating and make up your mind. The more you develop your intuition, the better you'll do at work. 
CANCER, If you begin to feel irritated over others' lack of support, it is only because you are under such pressure and have come to expect so much. Realise that other people can only contribute in relation to their time, skill and experience. It is futile to expect more. 
LEO, It is because you were born under the creative sign of Leo that you have such a strange and vivid imagination. Yet, now it is other planets in other signs which are driving you to implement your vision of the future at any cost. In particular, you're about to discover your business aptitude. 
VIRGO, Professionally speaking, the pace of events is picking up. Do not sit by while others take the lead. Now is the time to shed your passive image and show that you have as much initiative as any of your friends or colleagues. Waste no time. Seize the day! 
LIBRA, A challenge from Mars lends you added vigour. There is therefore no reason to feel trapped by a relationship which has lost its sparkle or by colleagues who have failed to recognise your true worth. Break free from repressive circumstances and attitudes. 
SCORPIO, There is no doubt about your ability to get important projects off the ground, and every chance that your efforts will be rewarded. You can expect a reasonable degree of success, but perhaps not the triumphal victory parade you've been dreaming about. 
SAGITTARIUS, Time is on your side, and it would be foolish to rush into any financial commitments until present planetary influences have abated. You must be sure that other people will keep their side of the bargain, otherwise you will probably decide to drop out before you get in any deeper. 
CAPRICORN, It is other people's deep-rooted emotional insecurity which makes them unable to accept what you say and do at face value. This has been the cause of so many arguments and disputes in past years, yet now you may act to break the cycle perhaps forever. 
AQUARIUS, Continuing supportive aspects from Jupiter signify that this is the ideal time to lay all your cards on the table. Just one word of advice, though; ensure that you don't overplay your hand. You do not want to overreach yourself, especially not at this stage. 
ARIES, Money will be of increasing importance over the next few weeks. The simple reason is that it will become blindingly obvious that you won't be able to afford some of your plans unless you boost your income. Secret romances are signified by Venus' changing position, but only because passions could be over-heating! 
TAURUS, Now that Venus, planet of love, is moving into new and romantic regions, you must make friendship and social life your priority. It seems inevitable that a special new person will be walking into your life. Magnetic Mars only reinforces this lively message, but could also significantly raise the financial stakes. 
GEMINI, Geminians who have professional ambitions will now find it much easier to get along with people at work. All of you will soon discover that you receive much wider appreciation for your achievements. Mercury's curious motion rather suggests that you'll meet occasional delays and broken arrangements, though possibly in a good cause. 
CANCER, You will soon be faced with an important personal choice. You may even be encouraged to take a major risk. However, you must move cautiously, otherwise you may make a loss or run up a large debt. Be aware that most people are liable to be in a rather unpredictable mood, and that a close partner could need careful handling. 
LEO, Mercury encourages you to be even more obstinate than usual, mainly because there are times when you're convinced that you're right. There is nothing wrong in this. After all, why should you compromise with people whose knowledge and understanding are so much less than yours? You will sense a vital financial opportunity towards the end of the week. 
VIRGO, Your material well-being needs a little extra attention. You could even be running up additional expenses. Yet this is all part of life's annual cycle, so no doubt you'll cope as well as usual. Social trends are set to sparkle after Thursday, and the generally optimistic and colourful influences continue to create a general sense of hope. 
LIBRA, The week's major planetary movements favour your interests, whether at work or at home. However, you may be knocked off balance by a feeling that all is not right moneywise. Watch out for confusion and misunderstandings midweek; as long as you avoid too many complications, you should steer clear of emotional chaos. 
SCORPIO, Some of the planets are in contradictory mode, others are at peace. So while there are people around you who may be in an argumentative frame of mind, others will be on your side. In a positive sense, this may be a good time to get something off your chest. Venus brings excellent developments in all intimate affairs. 
SAGITTARIUS, Family and domestic concerns become steadily more important, so it's clear that you should press ahead with decorations and repairs at home. The auspices are also fine for family entertaining, so bring relations together. At work, see to it that your better ideas and plans are perfectly understood and supported. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon makes some of its most intriguing alignments on Wednesday and Thursday, so it stands to reason that these could therefore be the best times for family occasions. Watch out for hidden financial costs. It is difficult to see that there is anything that can genuinely harm your personal interests at the moment. 
AQUARIUS, The risk this week is of clashes with colleagues at work or people in authority. Such arguments may flare up without warning, so be prepared and ready to do your best to restore a good feeling. The best opportunities, both personally and professionally, come later in the week, so save your fire. 
ARIES, Two very unnerving planetary aspects are set to continue, and your best strategy is to realise that other people cannot always be relied upon. Once you understand this, you'll stop expecting them to achieve the impossible. Be more realistic, just for a change! 
TAURUS, Close partners really are so terribly difficult to fathom, for some mysterious reason. Why, you ask, should they persist in making what is so very simple, so terribly complicated? Just accept that their view of reality is different from yours and leave them to it! 
GEMINI, You may look to family members for support - and expect to get it! You must work hard to achieve your aims and boost your income. By all accounts you have a flare for business, but in this, and in relationships, you're moving towards a high risk strategy. Play to win! 
CANCER, From now on, probably for up to ten weeks, you will be going over old ground. Yet, nothing repeats itself exactly, and you will still be carving out the future, even though it doesn't always feel like it. There may be some frustration as a result, but use the opportunity to do now what you failed to get right first time around. 
LEO, Family members or people you live with still seem to insist on raking over the past. Just why they should be so reluctant to let go may be a mystery to you, but they have their reasons. You have to give other people time to catch up, so be patient - at least for now. 
VIRGO, If you have said your piece, that's fine. However, there may be more to say before the air is well and truly cleared, so start laying down the law. The only people who will be surprised will be those who have always misjudged you. And perhaps that's about time! 
LIBRA, You've got one last chance to reach your targets, so don't squander it. Your business arrangements still seem a little complex, but you could be making a mountain out of a very ordinary molehill. The best thing you can do today is pamper yourself. You deserve it! 
SCORPIO, It's very important to discover just how things reached their current state, even if it means going back over memories that are half-forgotten, or even completely buried in the past. Somehow the truth will out. The sooner you get your story ready, the better! 
SAGITTARIUS, Some things are so utterly obvious, others so terribly obscure. The best advice is probably to tackle financial matters and spending plans first, then the emotional issues. You need to deal with details but don't dig too deep, for you may not like what you find! 
CAPRICORN, The whole mood of the times is still pregnant with romantic possibilities and emotional power. You need change and variety, and without these things you may blame the people you're with for holding you back. Mind you, perhaps you're equally responsible! 
AQUARIUS, You may be slightly bemused by the way professional plans have developed, for there seems to be little rhyme or reason behind a number of recent events. Much the same goes for your romantic life. Give up trying to make sense of the world and enjoy it instead! 
ARIES, Both the professional and business regions of your chart are looking profoundly unstable. The only certain consequence is that where there is change, there lies opportunity. Seize it while you can, for the same offer might not come round again, at least not until your desires have altered. 
TAURUS, Your mind and emotions are buzzing with energy. Life is full of potential for endings, but also for new beginnings. Sometimes this will be difficult, sometimes easy. Do yourself a favour and look at the underlying purpose of even apparently chance events. 
GEMINI, Intensity in relationships will be matched by a sense of insecurity and anticipation in finances. Psychologists have long noted the connections between money and desire, and you will be trying to balance your need for emotional stimulation with your longing for material security. 
CANCER, This doesn't look like a good moment for compromise. This isn't to say that you shouldn't try, but that your efforts will probably fall on stony ground. It's far better to state your case as honestly as you can, and give others a fair hearing. 
LEO, Watch out at work - and in all dealings with people in authority. Such ambitious and pompous people are likely to be increasingly irrational, even though they imagine they are being incredibly reasonable. Don't rise to provocation, for you'll be walking straight into a trap. 
VIRGO, It is time to dredge your psychological and emotional depths for every single forgotten talent and creative gift. There have been few moments as good as this for creative self-expression, so indulge yourself while you can. And don't let routine duties stand in your way. 
LIBRA, Your finances could be in turmoil, your family life driven by radical change. The very least that you can expect is that someone close will put on an emotional display and flounce out! Will you run after them? Well, you'll have to take a good, long look at the situation, and make a cool and calculated decision. 
SCORPIO, Mercury, ruling your intellect, now links up with Pluto, the planet which signifies your deepest instincts. The best that can be hoped for is a flash of enlightenment; the worst, that you'll mistake your personal desires for universal truth and end up on the wrong track. 
SAGITTARIUS, A business association, joint financial arrangement or intensely personal matter has been fraught with difficulties. If these are brought into the open, everyone will know where they stand and all will be well. If you can create harmony now then it should last for a long time. 
CAPRICORN, If anything, today's social and emotional patterns are more dramatic, revolutionary and unpredictable than yesterday's. It will be a rare individual indeed who gets through the day without at least one intriguing encounter. There is nothing to say except expect the unexpected! 
AQUARIUS, The gulf between what is said and what is not is so great that any real understanding seems impossible. The only truth seems to be the old mystical paradox that nothing is true. It could now be time to let a friend into a secret, by the way. 
ARIES, Watch out at work. Venus and Uranus are linked in mysterious ways, revealing that you are walking an emotional tightrope, and that you should avoid both giving offence and rising to provocation. The same advice goes for home and family matters, although the chances of a surprise are not as great as they were. 
TAURUS, The most important patterns in your chart have a great deal to do with overseas and long-term influences. It may well be, for example, that to achieve your romantic goals, it is necessary to visit foreign parts. One way or another, you require adventure to lift your emotional life. 
GEMINI, Everything that took place over the past few days, especially in the personal sphere, will continue to affect you over the next few months. It's therefore important to understand the causes for both your successes and failures. And once you've figured out why you did what you did, you'll do it better next time! 
CANCER, The power to lighten your emotional burdens is growing stronger, but whether you are prepared to take the final step is another matter. It is never easy to make a break with the past, even with old habits, but that is what you must now do. All it takes is courage! 
LEO, Always remember that you hold many of the trump cards. The fact is that you depend on others for your security, but they are also relying on you to satisfy their needs. In any personal tiff, your negotiating position is therefore strong, and will remain so. 
VIRGO, This is no time to be a shrinking violet. Two powerful patterns in your chart urge you to let go. One lends added force to your ideas and intellect, another raises the emotional temperature, so go for it! You never know - you might just amaze yourself. 
LIBRA, Strange and unsettling alignments emerge from the region of your solar chart denoting home and family. On the positive side this is a moment for giving in to the emotional undercurrents. A more cautious note should be sounded by the risks of hasty and ill-judged actions. 
SCORPIO, There is much to be said about intimate matters, not all of it clear or rational. In fact this is a suitable moment to chuck logic out of the window and accept that the only thing which makes much sense is how you feel. Folk who stick to the facts could be missing the point. 
SAGITTARIUS, The spotlight is on money and relationships, always an explosive combination. Others will be coming to you with wonderful ideas for making a quick buck and grabbing a bargain, but do they really know what they're talking about? Probably not! 
CAPRICORN, Venus, planet of love, extends the hand of friendship to Uranus, ruler of sudden and dramatic change. The most important qualities in your love life now will be freedom, independence, change, variety and experimentation! That sounds like a recipe for success! 
AQUARIUS, People around you may be confused. And you are certainly perplexed. The problem seems to be that your feelings are moving very fast, and that you are having difficulty in keeping up. All you need is more time and more space. This is surely not too much to ask! 
ARIES, The Moon maintains its supportive position so you should feel relatively strong emotionally. Legal, educational and travel matters should all benefit, but the underlying need is to maintain a morally impeccable standard. That's the best way to earn respect. 
TAURUS, Hopefully, you are so involved with new ideas or projects that you are able to keep your distance and let others work out their problems without troubling you. You owe nothing to people to whom you have made no promises, so don't submit to undue emotional pressure. 
GEMINI, Partners' fantasies may not be your business, but they have the power to make them so! You'd better take an interest from the beginning or risk causing needless offence to people who feel let down or ignored. You know the rules - if you're nice to people now, they'll stand by you later. 
CANCER, There seems to be little let-up at work or in your routine chores. Whether you're in paid employment or tied to domestic chains, the planetary message is clear and unequivocal: stick with it! And a partner who wants you to do what they want, might just have to wait for a while! 
LEO, Recently you seem to have been caught in some sort of emotional tug-of-war. The situation has now eased, although there is still plenty to come to light. Continue your inquiries, and examine your own behaviour. And, above all, be kind to people who have given you their trust. 
VIRGO, With so much planetary activity stressing personal ties and involvements it seems that you must make whatever effort is necessary to see that all goes according to plan. Family members, children and loved ones will be queuing up for your gentle attention! 
LIBRA, It's because enthusiastic alignments are so active that your whole outlook should be optimistic and hopeful. It's one of those strange times when, if you believe in the best, the best may happen! And the results will be even better if you set a fine and noble example. 
SCORPIO, You might still have a few doubts, but not for much longer. There may be some sort of financial sacrifice necessary now, but a little extra spending in the short term should guarantee you extra earnings in the long run. Just how this is to happen is as yet unclear, but all will be revealed in good time. 
SAGITTARIUS, You can continue to play the game your way, even if partners have different ideas. Change the rules, move the goal posts and do whatever you like to see that you come out on top. The one area where risks are taboo is financial, especially if you're dealing with other people's cash. 
CAPRICORN, There is much uncertainty in the air and you still seem to be unsure of your own feelings. Until you have made your mind up, any commitments should only be for the short-term, if only because you need to take a fresh approach when circumstances change - as they will surely do. 
AQUARIUS, You are a person of contradictions. Outside, all is social confidence. Inside, all is romantic turmoil. You have no choice but to follow your feelings wherever they take you, but do tread carefully. If you can come out of this period with a friendship strengthened, then all will be well. 
TAURUS, Business matters are shooting up the agenda. It is not clear whether it's your income or expenditure which is on the increase, only that it is joint affairs which matter. Take others' wishes into account at every turn, especially if business and pleasure begin to merge. 
GEMINI, The Moon casts its net far and wide, encompassing your relationships along the way, so it would be foolish to imagine that the emotional level will stay as it is. You must realise that this is a partner's chance to shine, so don't begrudge them their advantages. 
CANCER, It is necessary to stay busy and keep active. The strongest region of your chart concerns work, and your purpose should be to get as much under your belt now, so as to leave you with spare time over the coming days. Even romantic matters require extra effort. 
LEO, It's the pleasure principle which stands out in your chart at the moment. You have a choice as to whether you direct your energies into having fun or developing long-lost creative gifts. But don't waste your time, otherwise you'll end up feeling as if you've let an opportunity slip through your hands. 
VIRGO, There could be pressure for change at home. However, it should pass very quickly so, if you are determined to make much-needed improvements, you should seize the moment rather than leaving it until tomorrow. And don't forget - there is nothing wrong with enjoying yourself! 
LIBRA, You have your peculiarities, just like everyone else. Right now you should be letting friends in on the secret, spreading your wilder ideas around, and, more than anything, projecting an air of confidence and originality. But can you manage it? Well, yes, but only if you believe in yourself. 
SCORPIO, By the end of the coming week you will have come close to making a decision that has been put off for too long. Today, though, spare a thought for your financial situation, and do what you can to lift your earnings. You'll need extra cash if you are to pay for a dream. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon plays subtle emotional games today. This is a moment to be treasured, and you can usefully set time aside for reflecting on the past six months and meditating on the next half year. It is good to pause for thought, even if a personal plan is postponed. 
CAPRICORN, There is undoubtedly a great deal going on behind the scenes, even though much may exist purely in your imagination. It will therefore pay you to tread very carefully and think twice before you accuse anybody of anything. You need to get hold of all the evidence first. 
AQUARIUS, Hopefully your working and domestic commitments are at a minimum. The simple reason is that your social stars are looking quite splendid and if you lived in the perfect world you'd be out on one long romantic whirl. I'm sure you'll cope splendidly! 
TAURUS, The Moon is making its regular challenge to your sign, but in a rather nice sort of way. This is therefore the time of the month when you have to do what you're told. Or perhaps it would be true to say that if you allow others to take the lead now, you'll gain in the long run. 
GEMINI, It's undoubtedly a day to get up to date with all routine chores, secure in the knowledge that the more you achieve now, the more time you'll have off in the future. Go for broke and you might even amaze yourself. But, if you're liable to an attack of nerves, seek reassurance first. 
CANCER, Once in a while the planets send you messages which are at once helpful and constructive. Difficulties can be resolved if you rise to the challenge. However, if you take the right steps, life will be transformed for the better. In fact, there's no way but up! 
LEO, The Moon is aligned with the lower reaches of your solar chart, so you may turn your attention to the foundations of your life. In other words, before you can succeed in any worldly ambitions, family matters must be resolved - and quick! 
VIRGO, It's decision time again. However, it is unlikely that choices made now will be binding, so take as long as you like. The only essential proviso is that you talk to as many people as possible and gain as many different points of view as you can. A little wisdom, as they say, is a good thing. 
LIBRA, Check up on the week's financial plans. It's all a matter of dealing with the obvious, like whether you have enough cash in your purse. Avoid making unnecessary value judgments on partners' behaviour, by the way, because the chances are that you'll misunderstand their intentions. 
SCORPIO, The Moon is extra strong today, so it's your turn to shine. Your emotions may be slightly unsteady, but nothing you can't cope with. Besides, there's a profound businesslike air to the day's developments, and the people who do best will be those who get on with the job in hand - and don't get into a flap! 
SAGITTARIUS, Keep your feelings to yourself if you wish. It's a day to put vague suspicions to one side and instead to concentrate on whatever spiritual or mystical truth makes sense to you. When you notice the patterns that underpin your affairs, then you'll be ready to shift them to your favour. 
CAPRICORN, By all means continue to stand your ground over partnership or domestic matters, but you should understand that it's best to concentrate on the long-term rather than be drawn into daily squabbles. It's the shape of things this time next year that matters. 
AQUARIUS, It's a day for winning. This is not to say that you must come first, but at least you should compete. There is nothing to be gained from dropping out or refusing to fight just because you risk failure. And if you do have an attack of self-doubt, take your cue from people who have been in the same situation - and won. 
TAURUS, There is little to hold you back now, not even your own feelings of apprehension about the future. Powerful planetary patterns will enable you to distinguish your imaginary fears from limitations which are real and which must therefore be taken into account. Perhaps you would do well not to worry about the outcome. 
GEMINI, As Jupiter significantly adjusts its position, a struggle for supremacy should be drawing to a close, hopefully with you now taking the upper hand. You may still be undecided as to which way you should turn, and unless you are prepared to give up certain rights, you must expect other people to feel slightly miffed. 
CANCER, You will get off to a flying start, even though confusion and uncertainty may dog your footsteps. Once you escape from the lack of direction that has plagued you in the past, you will begin to make excellent progress. You may find that it was not you, but your close friends and partners, who were responsible for holding you up. 
LEO, The combination of charming Venus and aggressive Mars is almost irresistible. There will be few people, if any, who will be able to withstand your wiles and graces, and this does seem like an ideal time to achieve many of your goals. Romantic activities are well-starred, which is probably one of your major considerations. 
VIRGO, Mercury, your delightful and witty planetary ruler, is now coasting through a supportive region of your chart. This may be excellent for your work and professional hopes, but is not so hot as far as your emotional state is concerned. Don't worry, though, because you'll begin to see everything from an altogether different and even more positive perspective. 
LIBRA, Developments that are beginning to take place in your life now will accelerate and intensify as the weeks go by. You were at the centre of important emotional influences in recent months, but now that a personal issue is on the sidelines, you can redirect your energies. In fact, you are about to experience some amazing changes. 
SCORPIO, Mars, a planet which always has a special meaning in your life, is adopting a position which is broadly helpful, but not without a number of important consequences, personal as well as professional. In particular, you must be aware that teachers, employers or other people in authority will expect you to give your best. 
SAGITTARIUS, For as long as serious Saturn is aligned with your sign you must expect that both friends and partners will have the advantage in any joint ventures, but also that you stand to gain enormously from their efforts. Indeed, you must now wake up and realise the extent to which you have benefited from other people's generosity. 
CAPRICORN, The most important personal developments probably take place at the beginning of the next month, mainly due to the Moon's changing patterns and alignments. Much depends on how well you are able to organise yourself now, and whether you are bold enough to get away with a dramatic break from stale conditions. 
AQUARIUS, Venus and Mars are such important planets that you must take notice of any and every message they send your way. Right now, this remarkable duo is in exactly the right position to open up your social and romantic life. Do not be afraid to make the first move if that is the only way to get what you want. 
TAURUS, By now, sufficient pieces of the jig-saw have fallen into place for you to see the whole picture. Hopefully the pattern which is emerging is one which suits your general hopes and wishes for the future. Pluto is encouraging financial transformation, but it could be a little while longer before you really see where you're heading! 
GEMINI, Hopes of a boost in your career, or of success in an important leisure activity, should raise your morale today. This is definitely a good note on which to end a week which has seen you advancing in many areas. The best news is that there is still good news to come. 
CANCER, Now is the moment to move forward on all fronts. Waste no time and brook no opposition if you sense that your ambitions will be attained with just one more final push. There is no limit to what you can achieve, although to come top you need help from those you love. 
LEO, The time is coming when you must reorganise your working habits together with the way you cope with routine chores in general. Much domestic discontent may have focused around the way you do, or do not, fulfil your responsibilities. Oh, and sidestep a muddle at work. 
VIRGO, Money matters are well to the fore at the moment and it looks very much as if a partner is about to put forward a business proposition. Perhaps you will be asked to come in on a venture with profitable consequences. This is not the time, as a matter of fact, for financial speculation, so take no risks. 
LIBRA, Although much depends on what happens next week, you have reason to be satisfied at the course of events in recent days. There seems little doubt that underlying trends really do favour you and your loved ones. There could be confusion at home, so try to get a grip on the details. 
SCORPIO, An ordinary hum-drum existence doesn't suit you, as you may now have found out. What you should be doing is continually finding ways to explore your deep and intense emotions, with a view to freeing yourself from the stock responses of the past. Mystical Scorpios could be in their element. 
SAGITTARIUS, In some strange way you may benefit from the inability of certain people to see eye-to-eye, perhaps because they look to you for advice. You may be the only person who can restore peace. Socially you can follow a dream. You never know - it might come true. 
CAPRICORN, You must decide whether you wish to continue with your present course or make a complete break with the people and places of the past. The sooner you make up your mind, the quicker you'll deal with a current dilemma. On the other hand, at work, stand your ground. 
AQUARIUS, It's about time you stopped lecturing other people on how they should take radical initiatives and started following your own advice. Friends will respect you if you show some consistency and dedication. The Sun sails through benevolent regions of your chart, encouraging you to spread your wings. 
TAURUS, Money may be in short supply but, in view of developments over the last few days, this is perhaps to be expected. A hiccup such as this is usual before embarking on a venture calculated to change the course of your life. Check out a travel plan - now might be the time a treasured ambition comes true. 
GEMINI, There are sound reasons why you should now bide your time and leave a major new enterprise until later, perhaps until next year. Hold important discussions only after you're convinced that other people will be prepared to listen to what you have to say. Put your point of view with care. 
CANCER, No one can compel you to do anything against your will, so you have no need to fear pressure from partners or colleagues. However, it may be in your best interests to meet other people half-way. Partners still have the advantage, so you may have to be patient. 
LEO, By and large you're in for a friendly day, a moment to broaden your horizons and set your sights higher than in the past. This is no time to dwell on personal problems, however important they may seem. There are other people in your circle who require help and assistance far more urgently than you. 
VIRGO, Mercury forms a challenging but constructive relationship with the Moon, so there's every chance that a helpful agreement will be concluded. What a pleasant change it will make to find everyone who counts in an amicable mood. You will soon discover that partners are supporting you after all. 
LIBRA, You've had more than enough time to impress the people who matter, with your flare and charm. Now you must begin to rely on your deeper talents, realising that appearances are no guarantee of long-term success. At work, concentrate on improving relationships with colleagues. 
SCORPIO, Right now foresight and commonsense are your most valued qualities, and if you've been a little short on these lately, this is the time to make up for the lack and compensate for bad judgment at the beginning of the week. You might soon stumble on a major financial offer - one which was under your nose all the time. 
SAGITTARIUS, Enforced changes at home can make you even more determined then ever to get your own way. Actually, if you run carefully through the events of the last few days you'll see a pattern emerging in which you had a key part to play. Your self-esteem can only benefit. 
CAPRICORN, Count your blessings. So far, certain plans have worked out remarkably well in some respects, so put an end to your obsession with how difficult life is and how unfortunate you are. A confident manner will help you create a favourable and secure future. 
AQUARIUS, No one gains when you try to distance yourself from family members who have been doing their best to help you. You may as well just face the fact that their ideas about your future do not coincide with yours. Socially, you'll be able to make a splash by next week. 
TAURUS, You really must be more decisive if you want to implement any of the many schemes which have been coming your way. It's possible, of course, that you have been so obsessed with minutiae that you have completely missed some grand opportunities. 
GEMINI, This is a time of rewards, but also of increased responsibility and hard work. Perhaps personal gains will result from your success in dealing with chores which are really quite ordinary. Partners have the best ideas, so you may gain from accepting invitations you'd once have turned down. 
CANCER, Today's planetary picture should have a calming effect on your ambitions, particularly if you've been planning to travel or are coping with any legal problems. But you may be too impatient to take rational decisions. Perhaps you can wait until your head has cleared. 
LEO, The proud Leo lion may be feeling a little bruised and battered after recent domestic tiffs, even if you've come out on top. Be magnanimous in victory and take the initiative in restoring trust between friends. Your financial prospects couldn't be better, by the way. 
VIRGO, Your main concern is to see that order is maintained in spite of indications of impending chaos. Partners and loved ones are waiting for you to come up with a solution to a problem that you feel is none of your making. Turn your attention to money - your ideas are smarter than you think. 
LIBRA, Just because a partner is in a pushy mood, that is no reason to give way on issues which are vital to your happiness and well-being. If you hold your ground, others will be forced to respect you. At home, a relation seems to be helping you behind the scenes. 
SCORPIO, Although your position once seemed so secure, there are new factors to take into account. Someone, somewhere, is convinced you have let them down. It is no use imagining that you can go on as before, pretending that nothing has happened, and you must now arrange a peace meeting. 
SAGITTARIUS, How did you manage to arrive at the situation in which you now find yourself? It's probably hard to unravel the exact chain of events, but that's no reason to absolve yourself from all blame! The Moon's support, as a matter of fact, helps you get your way at home. 
CAPRICORN, You may be waiting for other people to cheer you up. What may please you now is if someone comes forward with an apology for a past misdemeanour, or a bright idea as to how you can improve conditions for yourself. Be in no doubt that you are in command of the situation. 
AQUARIUS, Your main concern must be to get partners to give you an idea as to why they feel so strongly about issues that, as far as you are concerned, are of no importance whatsoever. Attempt to see the other side of the coin for a change, and view the world through a partner's eyes. 
TAURUS, How about allowing yourself to relax now that the pressure seems to have eased up a little? But you should work to heal those wounds which have been re-opened by recent arguments. Joint finances move up the agenda, so if you do have a chance to harass the bank manager, you may well have a surprise success. 
GEMINI, For once everything seems to be going your way. At least, that is the message coming over loud and clear from a planetary picture which has your best interests at heart. Deal with money sooner rather than later and get the most out of a professional opportunity. 
CANCER, For as long as the Moon exerts its emotional sway over your money, even indirectly, you will feel slightly sensitive about financial issues. Is it that you consider you may have let a friend down by not paying your way? You're still too busy, but, then, what's new! 
LEO, A domestic matter or family complication has certainly been giving you sleepless nights lately. Perhaps you have been trying to hang on to a mythical past which other people have now abandoned. If, by any chance, partners are still confused, have another go at enlightening them. 
VIRGO, There is absolutely no reason why you should agree to force the pace or consent to proposals which are frankly not in your best interests. Bide your time if this is what you feel is best for now. You should catch up with a family relationship and restore a favourite bond. 
LIBRA, You really must learn to listen to what partners are saying and doing. Sometimes it's not even enough to listen to their wise words - you should take their advice as well. And that might mean swallowing humble pie! You can put financial plans on the back-burner. 
SCORPIO, If people have been challenging your authority at home or at work, then this is largely because you have let both them and yourself down. There is every reason for you to try and re-establish your position as soon as possible, whatever partners say. 
SAGITTARIUS, Seeing that today's lunar alignment gives you total control at home, the time is fast approaching when a major reorganisation of your financial life must take place. Events which occur now, will make or break your economic situation for months to come. 
CAPRICORN, Upsetting or challenging circumstances play a familiar part in your life, so much so, in fact, that you take them for granted. Yet you must realise that the key to success lies almost entirely within your own hands. Once you've understood that simple truth, you'll be set on the road to good fortune. 
AQUARIUS, The Sun's relationship with Saturn implies that self-discipline is essential, if you are to accomplish tasks which express your creative nature. Look for avenues which will enhance your freedom and set a course for the next six or seven months - at least. 
TAURUS, Your charitable instincts will be at their strongest and, in return, you may be the fortunate recipient of financial aid or other material support. You should experience tangible gains by the end of the week. Relationships with children should improve, but only if your high standards are flexible. 
GEMINI, It's a day for hope and optimism, and you may receive welcome relief from the stress and strain of recent days. As a thinking, intelligent person, it's your responsibility to bring rivals together, enabling them to reach agreement as soon as possible. 
CANCER, In the absence of what you consider to be a genuine partnership, you may continue to work away by yourself, doing what you consider to be necessary for now. Patience is a virtue at the moment, especially if you've got a problem with people in authority. 
LEO, What a day! This is definitely the moment to climb Mount Everest, metaphorically speaking, of course! Further education beckons and, even those of you who have no intention of becoming students, should be searching for a personal path to massive self-improvement. 
VIRGO, You're approaching one of those rare times of year when your solar chart is relatively immune to stressful planetary influences. Why don't you seize the opportunity to lay the foundations for future achievements? In love, there's one problem; you may want more affection than anyone can possibly give. 
LIBRA, If you're looking for a way out of a financial mire, investigate the possibilities of either legal assistance or help which may arrive from friends overseas. The answer, though, will not be clear for a few weeks yet. But then the wait will be worth it. 
SCORPIO, Keep your mind on important matters and try to play down current emotional upsets. Too much time in the past has been spent indulging your own feelings for no good purpose. It's time to re-join the real world and assert your rightful place as one of the top people. 
SAGITTARIUS, Saturn, the most sober of all planets, stresses business matters. The sooner you rearrange your priorities and attempt to conserve your resources rather than wasting them, the better. You'll be contemplating learning a creative skill within about three months. 
CAPRICORN, You'll have to make an early start if you want to make the most of the Moon's constructive alignments. Late risers will find that partners and rivals could have the advantage for the rest of the day. There could be a mystery around today, perhaps involving lost information or instructions. 
AQUARIUS, You are entitled to feel that other people have been inconsiderate at work, yet that's no reason to do to others what they have done to you. Practice some of that noble Aquarian idealism, and impress partners with your vision of the future. 
TAURUS, Current planetary patterns have tended to make you over-confident in the financial sphere. You must bear in mind that purchases and commitments you enter into now will have to be paid for sooner or later. In love, take it easy and play it cool. 
GEMINI, You have no right to expect other people to bail you out, neither should they. That witty planet Mercury is urging you to take responsibility for your own actions, no matter what knocks your confidence has taken lately. The day's intensity could be unsettling, but you'll survive. 
CANCER, You have been waiting for a partnership to bear positive results for a considerable time. Yet no matter what you have done, the entire situation has remained maddeningly vague and a close friend has proved impossible to pin down. At work, take obstacles in your stride. 
LEO, Much as it disagrees with your basic temperament, when the Moon encourages service and self-sacrifice, as it does today, you must knuckle under and perform those chores and tasks which lesser mortals regard as normal. You're still full of energy, but don't burn yourself up. 
VIRGO, It is because Virgos are said to be so logical and analytical that many people fall into the trap of believing that you lack imagination. However, over the next two to three months, a number of close friends will discover the true extent of your talents. 
LIBRA, Mars' new location could indicate a bout of strong speaking. Your tendency to agree with what anybody else says gets you out of trouble sometimes, but right now you must stand your ground. Otherwise, business and financial affairs will take a turn for the worse. Mercury's support is genuinely helping you discover the truth. 
SCORPIO, After months of suppressed emotions and anger over the way you have been treated in the past, you may now speak your mind. Yet please be careful not to make any unfair allegations or unjust accusations. Keep a secret for a little while longer, and help others over a personal hurdle. 
SAGITTARIUS, So much is going on behind the scenes that you will tend to feel out of control of your own fears and suspicions. The planets are creating illusions to lure you into actions or statements you'll come to regret, so keep a clear head, at least for today. 
CAPRICORN, You're quite a shy person and are reluctant to show your true feelings, even to close friends. Today, you must make an effort to understand your emotional inclinations, otherwise you'll fail to maximise your potential. An adventurous approach in love wins the day. 
AQUARIUS, Seldom has so much depended on your ability to make your point with firmness and integrity, at the same time as steering clear of any statement or argument which is guaranteed to upset colleagues. If a new responsibility comes your way, you may have to accept, whatever your doubts. 
TAURUS, By the end of the week you will be in a rather more ambitious mood, and this will naturally favour those of you with professional goals to pursue. Face up to awkward discussions and decisions at home, no matter how difficult. A financial loss should be recovered, which could be better news than you imagine. 
GEMINI, The stars are definitely on your side, and serious discussions are now necessary. Those of you particularly singled out for special treatment are considering a further course of study. The other main factor in your chart indicates the possibility of many short journeys. 
CANCER, Financial prospects now seem to be in the forefront. You may even be involved in some sort of business venture, one which could be quite a departure from the past, and take you in some surprising new directions. In love, it is time to sit down and make plans, partly because a partner is now depending on you for emotional support. 
LEO, You're at a minor crossroads and you have some choice as to which path you should take. It is more than likely that you'll meet some sort of opposition to your plans. You may find, for example, it is possible that partners will raise difficulties concerning a shortage of money or some other problem. 
VIRGO, You should by rights be much busier than usual, and a feature of the current time could be a number of secret discussions and meetings. Listen to your intuitions, for a hunch could point you in exactly the right direction. A romantic encounter may lay the basis for a new long friendship 
LIBRA, Which way should you turn? You have some deep thinking to do and, in all honesty, it is probably personal affairs which should dominate your time, rather than concerns to do with work or social obligations. You may be dreaming of life in another place or with other people! 
SCORPIO, Why not allow yourself a little moment to pause and take stock. You have certainly done well in the past, though perhaps not as well as you could have wished. The best way to put yourself forward is to be sensible, wise, responsible and in command of all the facts. 
SAGITTARIUS, You are facing some intriguing questions, and there are no easy answers, but one way to go about your life today is to talk to people at every turn. Volunteer your own opinions, ask them what they think, listen carefully and try to pick up pointers for future action. 
CAPRICORN, Your stars are in a practical mood, so swing into materialistic mode and deal with important matters such as shopping, investments and savings. You must also begin to face certain practical questions, and plan for the future, rather than for the present. A stranger might become the most important person in your life. 
AQUARIUS, As time progresses, you will begin to feel more in control, and less subject to the whims of fate. Although you have the practical sense, it looks very much as if other people have the best ideas. A new collaboration will be extremely fruitful, but you may have to wait up to six months for the best results. 
TAURUS, The Moon's fresh celestial challenge indicates that you must accept help from wherever it comes. In fact, you should take good notice of everything that people say, improving your act for the future. If you're still uncertain about a few key decisions, give it a few days. 
GEMINI, The emphasis is on work, so if you're at home there should be plenty to keep you busy. Even leisure activities should be just that - active. The best relationships are based on joint interests rather than raw passion, so you need to stay alert to a partner's needs. 
CANCER, If it's love you're interested in, you may have to travel. The important thing is to talk about your feelings and make sure that others know how you feel about them. At home, you may follow the lead set by a child or younger relation. You never know - they might have the innocent, straightforward approach you're looking for. 
LEO, If other people are unable to reach agreement, there seems to be no point in arguing the toss. It's far better to realise that associates and loved ones must be allowed to go their own way. If they know what's good for them they'll come back to the negotiating table in good time. 
VIRGO, You are probably well-prepared for anything which may come up, and in any case friends will come to your aid. Today's lunar alignments favour short journeys and serious discussions. You may also have to choose between one family engagement and another. 
LIBRA, All those current challenging celestial aspects will enable you to force intensely personal issues out into the open, and you may dig as far into the past as you wish. If you're working, by the way, your thoughts must focus on ways to make conditions more pleasant. 
SCORPIO, You can take the initiative today, putting your foot down at home and determining the pace in affairs of the heart. Financially, keep your outlay down to a reasonable level and you'll be happier in the long run. And be ready for long-distance news. It might be just what you need. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your current emotional tactics have served you well in the past, but a new romantic campaign requires a more sensitive approach. Perfect old-fashioned manners and courtesy will assist your cause. Above all, you need to show that you care - and mean it! 
CAPRICORN, Now's your chance to prove how well-informed and on-the-ball you are. When it comes to planning your family future, your ideas may be considerably less definite than other people's. And, if you're attributing blame or praise for the past, you should try to pick the right targets. 
AQUARIUS, You may be too insecure or pre-occupied with important changes at work to bother with personal details. However, the best way to relax today could be with a spot of 'shopping therapy', spending a little of your hard-earned cash on whatever you fancy! 
TAURUS, Although the Moon's pattern is very helpful, it does require you to get on with your daily work. If you're looking for time off, you may have to wait until macho Mars comes into the picture. In other words, hang on until you finally feel your energy rise. 
GEMINI, No doubt you would like to be in a position to control social affairs to suit your tastes and predilections. However, friends and acquaintances seem to have minds of their own, and are extremely difficult to control. But, then, that's just what you're used to! 
CANCER, Although your weekly and monthly cycles put the emphasis on work, the daily pattern focuses on home and family affairs. At any rate, there should be a refreshing break in routine. Romantic feelings, by the way, will be enlivened by exotic imports! 
LEO, Your remarkable sense of perception must be telling you that certain associates have deep and hidden feelings. They might even be questioning your standards or beliefs. You may be keen to get to grips with the details, but first you must make sense of the larger picture. 
VIRGO, You should now be aware that the brakes were put on to prevent you from reaching a goal, perhaps because you are being saved for something better. In the final analysis this is one of those times when fate really does seem to take a part, and in which a spirit of acceptance will serve you well. 
LIBRA, Nobody would blame you if you began to get irritated by partners' refusal to be pinned down. However, you can make life that much easier by realising that you may have to get on and do your own thing by yourself. There doesn't seem to be any need to wait for others to make the first move. 
SCORPIO, The moment has come to put together a proposal which satisfies people at work, people you love and people at home, and of course yourself. Believe it or not, you will be able to please everybody at once. Or, what I should say is that you will, if you really listen to what they truly want. 
SAGITTARIUS, Remember that so much that is good, lasting and joyful is born out of your personal trials and tribulations. As you look back on the past, you will be able to see that a great deal for which you have to be thankful was indeed conceived in times of difficulty. 
CAPRICORN, Life is really not so bad after all! This is one of those moments when professional influences combine with financial, offering you a genuine chance for an increase in your earnings. Why don't you take the initiative and put out the relevant feelers? 
AQUARIUS, You are still in a position to achieve the kind of personal happiness and professional status you seek and deserve. The icing on the cake should be a feeling of increasing prosperity. Whether you actually have more cash is, perhaps, not so important. 
TAURUS, The combined role of magnetic Mars and disciplined Saturn has raised the profile at work, making it difficult for you to achieve your goals. The best results will be achieved by extra effort, rather than by waiting for others to do the job for you. 
GEMINI, Venus's close relationship to your sign indicates that, more than anything else, you must finally come to terms with your own emotional needs. Social plans may have to be re-thought, perhaps because your attitudes are changing, perhaps because someone you once admired no longer seems to fit the bill. 
CANCER, You must continue to take your bearings personally and professionally, with an emphasis on all activities involving other people and your own desire for prestige. You may look to the past for your inspiration, trawling through your experiences for fond memories. 
LEO, Life goes on in spite of the fact that you may have got the cold shoulder from people who were once warm and friendly. Try to understand the way they are feeling, and realise that they may need your sympathy. It's all a question of finding the right approach. 
VIRGO, Now is the moment to do some mental stock-taking, mainly concerning money. What you should be looking at are those financial arrangements that connect you to other people, and reconsider any recent commitments. You might decide that it's time to back out! 
LIBRA, Once you've tested the water, you might try laying down the law. You must insist that others meet you on equal terms, resolving emotional problems through a spirit of compromise. Be prepared for other people to change their minds, perhaps going back to a former position. 
SCORPIO, A clash with someone with whom you have previously been hand-in-glove could be settled very soon. One way or another, you should realise that colleagues at work must be allowed to go their own way. After all, they have a perfect right to their point of view. 
SAGITTARIUS, Potent planetary influences are forcing you to re-consider your position. It may be that by changing your mind now you will rediscover an earlier commitment, with favourable consequences all round. It's good to forgive, but not to forget- at least, if you don't want to repeat the same mistakes. 
CAPRICORN, Now you must be prepared for some kind of confrontation at home. Indeed, you should welcome a frank exchange of views which, if it takes place now, will save a great deal of trouble, perhaps in about eight weeks' time. There is still much to play for. 
AQUARIUS, What appears to be upsetting now is the behaviour or attitudes of people who are lacking in feeling. Or is it just that they seem to be out of touch with their emotions, perhaps because of the practical strain they are under? If so, then be kind and considerate. 
TAURUS, Today's planetary set-up is not perfect, but it's still on your side. Your only concern could be whether you would rather spend time with casual friends or close partners - and that shouldn't be too much of a problem! If you're making big plans, by the way, try to look at them from a completely fresh angle. 
GEMINI, Nothing is ever as certain as you imagine, and even if you think that someone at work holds the key, you are likely to be mistaken. In spite of appearances, they are as likely to be in the dark as you. Could it be a case of the blind leading the blind? You'll soon find out! 
CANCER, You could still be counting the cost of an unwise investment or an unprofitable business association, but what saves you could be someone else's readiness to pick up the tab. There is so much to hope for at the moment that you really must believe in yourself. 
LEO, You are about to find out just how expensive love can be. You may as well throw caution to the wind and spend as much as is required to buy the emotional rewards you so deeply desire and deserve. But have you forgotten all those lessons from the past? Perhaps you have! 
VIRGO, The only thing wrong with being completely enthusiastic is that you may either lose touch with reality or with your partners' own hopes. Your best chances come from keeping the dialogue going and asking loved ones what they want. You don't have to give way to their every whim, mind you! 
LIBRA, Most of the pieces should now have been fitted into an emotional jigsaw. There may be one or two items still causing some doubt, and if you have any sense you will rely on your experience rather than vague hopes. And that's before you even begin to seek help from those in the know. 
SCORPIO, Perhaps more than anything else your feelings have been dominated by difficulties associated with home, some of which may be purely practical, while others seem to be nothing more than memories of what happened long ago. You are now coming out of this period wiser and more experienced. 
SAGITTARIUS, The approaching awkward encounter between romantic Venus and passionate Pluto is now pulling you very sharply in two directions, and emotional choices are becoming critical. The question is how much longer you can sit on the fence? Probably for a very long time! 
CAPRICORN, Once again the Moon is on your side, steadying your emotions and endowing you with a sense that you are indeed on the right track. In love, you may express yourself as poetically as you like and with as much originality as you can muster. There is no alternative! 
AQUARIUS, If shopping trips are on the agenda, you may go for luxuries rather than necessities, and if investments are looming, aim for the arts as the most lucrative field. Above all, you should take charge of your finances, rather than being swamped by them. 
TAURUS, If you are now faced with a break or separation, you should believe that all is for the best. Any change will affect your work and daily routine first, and your romantic life second. And then there's the little matter of a promise you made to someone else. Can you actually fulfil it? If not, you'd better say so now! 
GEMINI, This is time for inspiration - but also confusion. In all close, emotional relationships you must decide whether it is your pride that comes first, or your selfless desire to help a loved one achieve a cherished ambition. But can you do both? Well, perhaps! 
CANCER, You may wish to abandon unwanted commitments, but you are beginning to wonder whether freedom is really what you want! You should give yourself as much time as you need to ponder those all-important questions. Don't let someone else put unfair pressure on you. 
LEO, Questions of survival are high on the agenda, which in simple terms means shopping trips and foraging for life's little essentials. The most extravagant amongst you are about to take on a rash financial commitment. You'd better make sure that you can handle it! 
VIRGO, Venus is challenging your chart, indicating a powerful swing between emotional highs and lows. Bearing in mind that freedom of choice is vital, emphasise the happy periods, and steer yourself away from self-doubt. And if you need reassurance, find it where you can. 
LIBRA, For the time being at least, partners or close companions should be less inclined to criticise, although that doesn't mean that you won't worry about what they think. Please try not to be hypersensitive! The problem is, you see, that you might pick up the wrong end of the stick. 
SCORPIO, You are certainly in a position to get your own way, but you'll need a strong team to back you up. You may gather around you the supporters, allies and confidants who think as you do. An imminent family party could be especially memorable, as long as you've made the appropriate plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, Loved ones, close friends, offspring and intimate companions all appear to be carrying on in very odd ways. There is even a chance that after another few days have passed, life could begin to resemble nothing so much as a theatrical farce; so keep up your sense of humour. 
CAPRICORN, This could be the best day of the week for handling complicated questions, especially if there's a legal or ethical dimension. Do your best to maintain standards of behaviour without being pompous or dogmatic, for other people need to see that you have their interests at heart. 
AQUARIUS, Life hasn't always been easy. You know that! It's certainly been a long grind, but personal or professional recognition should now boost your confidence. You will even come to feel that all those upsets of the past were not in vain. Perhaps they have encouraged you to strive for higher standards. 
TAURUS, A day of domestic responsibility suits your general emotional needs. You may remember one very important fact when it comes to getting the best out of partners: other people will appreciate you very much more if you praise what is best in their behaviour, rather than criticising what is worst. 
GEMINI, Travel plans could be looming, but that doesn't mean that you will be on the move. It could be that others are coming to you, or that communication will be on the phone. One way or another, you should try to cultivate a global perspective, keeping at least half an eye on the big picture. 
CANCER, The simplest reading of your chart today is that it's a fine moment for dealing with financial matters, especially picking up fantastic bargains. A deeper interpretation is that it's time to get to grips with feelings of emotional insecurity - and work out where your doubts come from. 
LEO, The Moon plays a special role today, and in any circumstances that is an indication that you hold the key to all emotional relationships and developments. Use your power wisely, and never ignore your responsibilities. It's the least that other people expect! 
VIRGO, The whole of the week is coloured by romantic and social enthusiasm, so even though today's stars are slightly on the shy side, do yourself a favour and organise friendly gatherings for later. Also, be sensitive to other people's doubts, otherwise you will store up trouble for the future. 
LIBRA, It's precisely because social influences are quite strong that even at work co-operation and teamwork are absolutely essential. Don't try and go it alone, however secret and intense your real feelings may be. Look for support wherever and whenever you can find it. 
SCORPIO, You may devote as much time as is necessary to your professional aspirations, or to community affairs, both of which must be designed to enhance your reputation amongst your peers. Plus, troublesome financial matters may be deferred without too many worries. 
SAGITTARIUS, Unusual personal planetary patterns may be seen as good, because they make you confident and self-motivated, but difficult because you may resent partners' and colleagues' attempts to control your life. It's all a matter of striking the right balance. 
CAPRICORN, The developing romantic challenge between Venus and Jupiter is already stirring your emotions, beginning to produce new feelings of desire and longing. It's also encouraging you to reflect on the past. Just how this works out in real life will be clear by the end of the week. 
AQUARIUS, Serious Saturn and energetic Mars are still playing their part, bringing the need for discipline and hard work, but to a lesser extent than over the past few weeks. The coming tendency is towards extravagance and increased costs, some of which will be your own choice, some other people's. 
TAURUS, Challenges lie ahead, and you are assisted by rising energy levels. You should come forward and seize the initiative at home, even though you may have doubts about taking a risk which exposes your emotions. Later on, you'll be more inclined to spend time by yourself or in your own private world. 
GEMINI, One very important development in your chart now finds you in a mood to change your mind. If you get an inkling that one arrangement is not for the best, make plans now. It is very important indeed to discuss your innermost feelings. Otherwise there is will be a misunderstanding. Cancer It's a useful moment for all ambitious Crabs and, if you are pursuing either an important professional goal, or increased status in your community, go for it now. Maternal-type relationships seem to be the most significant, and it looks as if you could benefit from people who come forward to protect you. When folk come to your aid, make sure you help them out as well. 
LEO, Mercury, which represents your thought processes, which has been making it much easier than normal for you to put your ideas across, is about to start behaving strangely. You may begin at once to question all those taboos you've taken for granted for so long. Your future can indeed be changed for the better. 
VIRGO, Money matters rise up your agenda, and financial plans should take first place, especially if joint arrangements are at issue. You should allow for increased intensity in intimate relationships, but don't fall into the trap of blaming others if you're not satisfied. At work it's time to take up an offer of training. 
LIBRA, Family members and work colleagues both have good advice for you, and you must listen to other people very carefully, for they understand you better than you think. You may be subject to some criticism, especially from people you live with, but if this helps clear the air, it will all have been worthwhile. 
SCORPIO, Your stars are moving this way and that with great enthusiasm. It's certainly a time to keep busy. Obviously, those of you at work will be stretched, but even if you were planning to put your feet up, the best leisure activities are those which lead to self-improvement. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a fine time for creative ventures, and all sporting activities should be successful  or, at least, satisfying! Within the family, children should take first place, probably because they have something to teach adults about living! At work, take it easy, as far as possible. 
CAPRICORN, Home and family affairs will intervene, even for those of you who had different ideas. The best careers seem to be those related to domesticity, like estate agent, builder or cleaner! Affairs of the heart could be proving expensive, so keep an eye on your cash and ask partners some searching questions. 
AQUARIUS, Collaboration and co-operation constitute your celestial theme for the week. It's a very useful time to share your ideas with others, especially concerning home arrangements and how they do or don't suit you. It may also be necessary soon to get in touch with a relation you haven't seen for some time. 
TAURUS, Make up your own mind and on no account listen to rumour or conjecture. In spite of your normal down-to-earth attitude, you are now likely to be the ideal victim of a practical joke, so take jests in good part. It's all down to the strange meeting between Venus and Uranus. 
GEMINI, Your planetary influences are bright and seldom have you been so forceful and determined to succeed. Yet you must expect partners to respond to your suggestions in an equally forthright manner. You should also be on stand-by for a few surprises. CANCER Although you may not care to admit it, for as long as certain planets remain in a tricky attitude to your sign, there is only a little you can do to find a permanent solution to a long-standing financial question. Yet today's Lunar patterns indicate than you can set the lead in all personal matters. 
LEO, Events and opportunities over the next two days may help you keep your head above water, even if they do appear out of the blue. Yet now that Neptune is so strong, do not expect everything to be clear and above board. Today's Sun-Moon alignment only enhances the air of mystery. 
VIRGO, Nobody is in a position to get the better of you financially. Drop your sentimental inhibitions and go all out to achieve your aims. It is decisive and speedy action which will serve your purposes. Your social stars are strong today, so there's an excellent chance of friendly distractions. 
LIBRA, It's because a partner is in such a demonstrative mood that you may be bowled over by a display of affection. Even when life is out of balance, as it is now, there is still plenty to reassure you that you are loved. You may even find that friends or colleagues look to you to take charge. 
SCORPIO, Now you must face up to situations you have tried to sweep under the carpet. Your attention is being focused on health and financial matters. Perhaps you should allow more time for useful exercise and improvements in your diet? It's possible that you also need to pick up a new skill or qualification. 
SAGITTARIUS, A conflict of personalities or interests appears to be making this a rather awkward phase. However, those of you who manage to combine humour with humility will not be put off by such problems, and will continue to flourish. And why not use today's Sun-Moon alignment as a springboard to renew a financial enterprise? 
CAPRICORN, Offers of advice may be irritating, for you are loath to admit that you are imperfect in any way. However, you are in need of practical assistance and there is nothing to be gained from denying this. In fact, the assistance you receive could be overwhelming and invaluable. 
AQUARIUS, Now is the time to air complaints and grievances, and to put your point across without wallowing in emotion or losing touch with the issues. Broadly, though, the world is still moving your way. All in all, it's a day to keep active and focus on what can actually be done to improve the situation. 
TAURUS, Allow nobody to convince you that other people are out to do you down, or that you do not have what it takes to win through. Circumstances are uncertain, but the truth of the matter is that you are still on the right track. Not only that, but a family surprise is brewing. 
GEMINI, Take any hold-ups or frustrations in your stride and continue on the path you have already set yourself. Events are still moving fast, perhaps faster than you expected only a short while ago, and you can afford a brief delay. You also need to take new feelings on board and work out what they mean. CANCER If you can hang on to the feeling of well-being that has worked so well for you in the past, you will be doing yourself a big favour. As usual your timing will be spot on. It is other people who are out of step. But then, what's new? You're often ahead of the game. 
LEO, Emotional or family matters seem to be past their critical stage unless, that is, partners are still out of sorts. However, it will be a fairly straightforward matter to take steps to safeguard your long-term happiness. For a start you can make the most of your irresistible charm. 
VIRGO, Contradictory planetary influences have been at work for some time now, although current pressures are by no means as tough as those you have faced in the past. You are better placed than most to deal with intractable family issues. In point of fact, a friend might have the best idea of what's going on. 
LIBRA, You are about to discover perfect opportunities for advancement on the work front, although the offers which come your way may at first sight seem to provide little in the way of professional potential. The key to your success lies in the wider context of what is taking place around you. 
SCORPIO, Misguided people often react with disapproval to your unusual, not to say strange, sense of humour. There are times when you might be advised to hold your tongue rather than risk causing offence. You may have to speak your mind today - but try not to offend. 
SAGITTARIUS, A whole plethora of favourable planetary aspects has made this a week relatively free from unpleasantness and hassles - just as long as you have stuck to the straight and narrow. Only you know what you must do now to get your material affairs in order. 
CAPRICORN, You must now work harder than ever to battle against feelings of personal inadequacy or insecurity. Show what a great person you are by rising above the murky depths which seem to fascinate other people. And do whatever you can to give fresh impetus to a flagging relationship. 
AQUARIUS, There are certain ties and involvements which must now be causing you some concern. As a general rule, handle partners with kid gloves unless, that is, you are prepared to deal with minor emotional crises. You see, it's awfully easy to stir up hidden emotions at this stage in the lunar cycle. 
TAURUS, If you deign to discuss your plans today not everyone will be appreciative of your ideas. It's actually more likely that you will keep your intentions secret, realising that you are currently ahead of the times. Or, at least, that's the way you feel! 
GEMINI, Social plans and commitments seem to be definitely connected to spiralling costs. Is there any way in which you can rearrange your finances so as to cut down on unnecessary spending, even if other people complain? I say that partly because, otherwise, family expenses may increase. CANCER The planets are in a demanding mood, though it's unlikely that you'll be sucked back into the conflicts of the past. This period is far more positive, and you may profit from pressures imposed on you by family and relatives. That said, the next few days find you in a very strong position. 
LEO, You hold most of the trump cards, although bear in mind that help is vital if you are to reach your goals. In particular, you may need advice on the legal or ethical implications of your plans. You also have the edge in a close emotional relationship, which means that it's up to you to look after a partner's feelings. 
VIRGO, All may not be sweetness and light, at least not as far as personal relationships are concerned, but there is a strong case to be made for meeting disagreements head-on. Harmony and co-operation will be restored just as soon as outstanding differences have been aired. 
LIBRA, Enjoy all the praise and attention you receive from partners, and don't resent criticism when it is well-intentioned. Also, feel free to seek out only those people and places that please you. Actually, this is quite an ambitious day, one when you will be able to accept - and relish - a new responsibility. 
SCORPIO, Make the most of favourable planetary aspects to press ahead with routine chores both at home and at work. On no account should you involve yourself in arguments or debates which do not concern you. In matters of the heart, your hopes are high - so keep your feet firmly on planet earth. 
SAGITTARIUS, Although nobody can deny that you have behaved impeccably, this is not the point. Ordinary standards of behaviour do not apply at a time when you are attempting to liberate yourself from past restrictions. But what I would say is this - you're happiest surrounded by familiar faces. 
CAPRICORN, Soon you will have to accept a proposition relating to your career, or place more emphasis on ambitions which are purely personal and private. You may be tempted to decline an offer once and for all. If you're filling in your social diary for the next few days, then keep some time spare for surprises. 
AQUARIUS, You have so many irons in the fire, it is no wonder that you are running out of time. Only you can know how the choice you must soon make between different options will affect your future happiness. But, actually, you don't yet know exactly what the choice will be! So much is still to be revealed. 
TAURUS, For once the world is looking like a better place. For as long as you put your troubles behind you and adopt an optimistic attitude, circumstances in general will continue to improve. You also need to stick to your commitments but, then, loyalty comes naturally to you. 
GEMINI, You're not the first to realise that confidence is the key to success, or to understand the simple truth that it is up to you to make the most of your planetary potential. Therefore, do not let other people put you down. But neither should you rise to the bait. Keep calm. CANCER You should now begin to feel a whole lot better about worries that have tended to hold you back, and you'll be putting such imaginary cares and woes into perspective. It's important that you believe in yourself. It will help to get the facts straight! 
LEO, You have had a very tense period up until now, which is why it must be all the more satisfying to feel the effects of relaxed and friendly planetary influences. The only word of advice is not to try and force your opinions on other people. You'd do much better to charm them. 
VIRGO, Financial deals and schemes must now take up more of your time. Generally the auspices are very favourable, yet the planets still insist that without partnership and co-operation your personal success cannot be guaranteed. You need expert advice at every turn. 
LIBRA, Colleagues and professional associates are assuming a greater importance in your life, although not necessarily in a way which pleases you. Nevertheless, you must allow other people to play a full part in all joint activities, and accept criticism where it is justified. 
SCORPIO, The Moon highlights short journeys today, so it is more than likely that you'll be called away suddenly. Also, don't be surprised if your routine is disturbed by letters or phone calls bearing unexpected news. If you have a choice, take tried and tested options. 
SAGITTARIUS, Domestic improvements or upheavals should by now be well and truly over, at least as far as the planets are concerned. If you have other ideas, this may be because you are suffering from delayed effects. There is more sense in partners' words than seems likely at first, so listen closely. 
CAPRICORN, You seem to have more than one option opening up as far as work is concerned. However, it may not be necessary to make a firm choice just yet, and it may even be advisable to spread yourself around. Plus, at work you need to be firm but flexible. 
AQUARIUS, This is a perplexing time, when you may not be sure what is the best way forward. It's possible that people close to you hold the answer to a current mystery, and you'd be advised to act on all good advice. Plus, keep your social diary open, as the next few days could bring last-minute changes. 
TAURUS, Secret assignations are high on the agenda, and this by no means suggests that you are out to deceive anybody. It may be perfectly reasonable, not to say necessary, to keep certain plans under wraps for now. But, then, you're used to waiting until the time is right. 
GEMINI, You are moving through a profoundly sociable phase. You must put yourself about as much as possible and may turn down invitations, even unlikely ones, at your peril. It is not possible to say which of your current contacts will be useful in the future. Wait and see! CANCER Please do not be troubled by secret fears. You're such a worrier but such imagined worries are the symptoms of half-understood stirrings in your mind. The purpose seems to be to urge you to get on and get to grips with lingering questions, and all will be revealed before long, perhaps within a month. 
LEO, If professional plans are underway please do not worry if movement appears to be slow. Analysis of your solar chart reveals that time is on your side and that there are further developments to come. In particular, a partner is due for a change of heart. 
VIRGO, You do not like messy situations so, if the unexpected happens, please try to bring about a solution as speedily as you can. On the other hand, do not expect all your hopes to be immediately fulfilled. After all, it is difficult to achieve your goals when you're still not sure what you want! 
LIBRA, Travel plans will offer a useful distraction from more weighty issues, such as legal questions, or problems you or a relative might be facing concerning higher education. The indications are broadly positive and, the higher you set your sights, the more you are likely to achieve. 
SCORPIO, Whatever is happening on a daily basis, please keep a close watch on long-term financial complications. While the present time may offer immense profits, you must leave nothing to chance - or, at any rate, as little as possible. The trouble is that you can't be exactly sure what is happening. All will be revealed in its own good time. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is just not possible to say for certain whether the outcome of present financial deals will be to your advantage, which is why advice that you are free to go ahead must be tempered with a thoroughly sensible dose of caution. And, socially, you'll be fascinated by people from very different backgrounds from yours. 
CAPRICORN, From now onwards you should keep family matters firmly in the loop. It just will not do to take decisions by yourself and expect others to meekly fall into line. On the other hand, once you have explained your ideas properly, they are sure to be welcomed. 
AQUARIUS, As this is a restless phase, please feel free to make a break in your routine, and don't allow colleagues or associates to hem you in. Professional tensions appear to have died down for now, although, if I could give you any advice, it would be to stand up for your rights - but recognise your responsibilities. 
TAURUS, You're sandwiched between events that are utterly down-to-earth and obvious, such as cash-flow worries, and feelings which could not be more vague and mysterious. Please don't let the latter interfere with the former. And do keep as much cash handy as you think you might need! 
GEMINI, You're still cruising along on the crest of a wave and there really is nothing that is beyond your skills and expertise. No longer will other people be able to accuse you of being a second-class citizen. In fact they might soon have to eat their words! CANCER Deep down you are so serious, and even though you often join in a good laugh with friends, your cares are never far away. There are ways to lighten your load, and the current week is a good time to start. Today you could think about new interests and fresh approaches. It might be that all you have to do is look at an old programme from an untried angle. 
LEO, It may seem some time since professional success occupied centre stage. This is as it should be, for now you have a chance to spread your wings and develop a wide range of contacts which may actually appear to have no immediate gain. There's nothing wrong with being selfless! 
VIRGO, Mercury, your special planet, is actively scheming on your behalf. A number of glittering prizes will be paraded before your gaze, but as ever it will be up to you to make the necessary moves. A social scene could also bring its share of secrets. 
LIBRA, Before the week is out the whole tenor of your discussions with partners will have changed. The personal significance and content will increase and your freedom to manoeuvre will be curtailed, which is actually a useful means of clarifying your options. 
SCORPIO, This is a busy time, so don't grumble if your responsibilities are increasing. Once you have dealt with the current crop of extra jobs you will be left with a welcome sense of achievement. Also, at work it's who you know that counts, so cultivate all important personal contacts. 
SAGITTARIUS, Domestic improvements should by now be moving along quite nicely, helped by Venus' harmonious influence. There should be little to prevent your reaching agreement on previously contentious issues. In fact, I can see no reason at all why you shouldn't also soon clear up a long-standing mystery. 
CAPRICORN, An influential group of planets aligned with private parts of your solar chart is as clear an indication as you could wish for that success is on the way. Just as your motivation is deeply personal, so the answers lie with you and you alone. Funnily enough, though, it may be partners who find the words to say what you mean. 
AQUARIUS, You are now entering a profoundly creative period, one in which your innovatory ideas will, for once, be widely appreciated. All you need is the confidence to sell yourself and the skill to take care of practical details. The day also favours the young at heart, so there's no need to stand on ceremony. 
TAURUS, It's a week for inspiration, so spend time by yourself, and enjoy your day-dreams. It's also a beautiful moment for all Taureans who had the foresight to arrange a family party, for now is the time to meet up with people you haven't seen for months - or even years. 
GEMINI, Friendly planetary patterns certainly seem to be playing their part and, this week especially, you can draw other people into your plans. It's also an ideal moment for unrestrained extravagance, assuming you've the spare cash, of course. A matter of the heart will take a very unusual turn. CANCER You may be seized with the urge to work much harder. A spot of overtime, perhaps? However, the most suitable leisure activities seem to be those which bring honour and prestige or, at least, urge you on to new heights of achievement. You might also soon sign up for a course to learn a new skill. 
LEO, Your stars pull you in different directions this week. On the one hand, hard work, including domestic routine, seems to be beset by muddles but, on the other, it can seem strangely inspiring. It probably all depends on how practical you are - and also on how you get on with other people. 
VIRGO, Sometimes life's little restrictions build up into something big. You probably feel like breaking out, and it does indeed seem that you have been held back for too long. A financial risk may also seem worthwhile, but spending on treats and luxuries may be more enjoyable! 
LIBRA, The place to entertain definitely seems to be in the home. Your chart indicates the possibility of children's parties, but it's also time for adults to let their hair down and rediscover their lost youth. Professional partners, though, now need your unswerving support, so don't judge them too harshly. 
SCORPIO, It's a week to stay active. Even social relationships work best if you find a joint hobby to pursue rather than waiting for the hoped-for 'good time' to materialise. Older relations need your assistance with specific practical questions, so be prepared to step in and lend a helping hand. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your stars are taking an adventurous turn. Travel, money and self-indulgence are the three important factors in your chart. Will you be splashing out on the trip of a lifetime? Or travelling for miles in search of the perfect bargain? Don't forget the spiritual dimension, and continue your quest for the meaning of life. 
CAPRICORN, Your Venusian alignments are almost perfect  they are certainly lively - and you should be infused with love. The only risk is that you could mishandle things rather badly, but forewarned is forearmed, so take care and always stay cool. At work, colleagues are likely to make mistakes only you can remedy. 
AQUARIUS, Secret desires are the order of the week. There is absolutely no reason at all why you shouldn't fantasise to your heart's content - everyone else does! It is important, though, not to feel inhibited should you want to tell others how you feel. Employers need extra respect, as it happens, so do your best, and fulfil your responsibilities as best you can! 
TAURUS, A great philosopher once said that in my beginning is my end, suggesting that all future possibilities are contained within us even before we start. As the Moon plays its part today, it would be worth pondering what sort of future you are creating for yourself, and make it a good one! 
GEMINI, Today's emotional Moon takes you right away from materialistic concerns towards the inner meaning of everything you do. Your spiritual values will help you assess what is worthwhile, and what is not. Only you know what these really are, so your conscience should be your guide. CANCER Excellent social stars urge you to get out and about as much as possible. The best arrangements are those based around joint activities, perhaps with a real purpose. Any sense of achievement will contribute towards a contented day. That's why it's a good idea to press on with the tasks which really matter to you. 
LEO, Recent failures can be turned into triumphs with extra determination. This is a competitive time which naturally suits all sporting types but, for all of you, the critical decision will be when to leave the starting block. You have about three days at the outside. 
VIRGO, There could be legal matters to sort out, travel plans to arrange, and ethical questions to ponder. In its essence, though, this is a day for adventure, and it really doesn't matter what you do as long as you stretch yourself. You should also keep a close eye on rising costs. 
LIBRA, You may benefit immensely from partners' enthusiasm. It's also an excellent day for pursuing business ventures. Large purchases are suggested, but the key is to be found in other people's involvement. Those in the housing market can hope for rapid progress. 
SCORPIO, Partners are sure to dig their heels in. However, the more certain they appear, the greater their secret confusion. Therefore, you must be sensitive and sympathetic, and at all costs don't come on like an emotional battering ram - you'll only drive people away! 
SAGITTARIUS, Stay active and realise that the best relationships are those based on joint interests. In love, pure passion fades, and something needs to be found to take its place. That is why this is a fine moment to put emotional partnerships on a sounder footing. 
CAPRICORN, It's a promising day for all competitive activities and creative pursuits. It's also a moment to let your hair down and remember that it doesn't matter whether you're young or old. What's important is to be young at heart, and take each day as it comes. 
AQUARIUS, There's a strong chance of major improvements at home, but it's not a hundred per cent certain. What is undeniable is that family relationships lie at the exact centre of everything that you do. Even people who are a long way away can have an impact on your emotions. 
TAURUS, Respect a partner's confidence and understand that other people's points of view may be understandably different from yours. Don't pass judgment on those who fall below your high standards, and do try to be as understanding and sympathetic as possible. 
GEMINI, You're entering a new romantic cycle in which secrecy will be important. It could be that you wish to keep your feelings to yourself, but it also seems to be the case that a dash of mystery will spice up your emotional life. Just make sure that you don't go behind somebody's back. CANCER You're now entering a more sociable phase, and you should sit down, get on the phone and fix up a few parties. At work, continue to keep a weather eye open for employers who don't know whether they're coming or going! You might be expected to clear up the mess! 
LEO, From now on, at work who you know will be as significant as what you know. It is therefore going to be incredibly important to make allies and influence people. Plus, your romantic aspirations will become more influenced by your desire for recognition and status. 
VIRGO, Business affairs should be tidied up today, so don't hang around if you think you've been diddled. You may be strapped for cash, but this will change once Jupiter has had its full impact on your chart. That, however, might not be for another few months. 
LIBRA, You must still pay greater attention than you might wish to partner desires. Yet you must realise the most fun and the best experiences can be had by allowing other people to take the lead. That way they take the blame if your plans don't work out - and you share the pleasure if they do! 
SCORPIO, Be thankful you were born under a sign of the Zodiac which is loyal, faithful and true, so long as partners treat you properly. The whole point is that over the next few days you may have to provide valuable support to loved ones who are under pressure. If you do your bit now, it won't be forgotten. 
SAGITTARIUS, The shift that takes place in your chart today indicates that conditions at work will improve, and that your part in such changes will be considerable. At home you should delegate tasks more effectively. After all, there is no reason why others shouldn't contribute their fair share. 
CAPRICORN, There is bound to be a fair bit of domestic confusion or family muddle, even if only on a minor scale. Trivial engagements may be affected - and perhaps postponed. The reason is the gulf that has now opened between how you would like things to be and the way they really are. 
AQUARIUS, Domestic entertaining begins to look like a more promising possibility, and family gatherings could be more pleasant than expected. At work, financial rewards should now be in the bag, otherwise you may have to wait another few months, by which time circumstances will have moved on. 
TAURUS, You really should consider keeping certain facts private. There is no reason why other people should know exactly what you're up to and, even less, for you to tell them. Raise your mystical interests a notch, for you need to understand not only what is happening - but why! 
GEMINI, Bearing in mind that this is essentially a sociable day, even at work you should make teamwork your priority. One thing you must be clear about is that if you want your plans to succeed you will have to convince other people that you are in the right. CANCER It's not just that you've had a few knocks that matters, it's that you're more sensitive to them. You should now be on the mend, although there still seem to be one or two surprises in store. Be careful about how you pursue professional ambitions, for there are banana skins in view. 
LEO, Take a break from profound moral questions and turn your attention to travel plans. It might be a spiritual voyage which matters most, though, so keep an open mind. Also, realise that someone close who is chasing an educational qualification needs your support. 
VIRGO, The focus still seems to be on financial affairs, not necessarily because of what is happening now, but because of what is due to take place some way down the line. There does seem to be scope for you to make a number of wise investments. You may still rely on your innate charm, but only just! 
LIBRA, This is very much a time to broaden your horizons, realising that certain people whom you have ignored have things to offer which you should now take up. In the past, you have been too ready to turn down help. There's no point in struggling on alone if you don't get where you want! 
SCORPIO, Relationships need to be worked at. This is less a time for passion, more one to realise that the best way to get on with friends is to join in their activities and show an interest in their hobbies. You might have to put your own desires to one side for a while, but that's a noble thing to do. 
SAGITTARIUS, Romantic passions could flare, but oh so briefly. If it's adventure of the heart you're after, you will therefore have to move quickly to seize the moment. At work, bide your time just a little longer. And, at home, throw out all that clutter and dump some of that emotional baggage. 
CAPRICORN, Think about your dream home. What exactly would you prefer? Where would you like to live? And who with? These are the sort of questions which can be answered now, even if putting them into practice is a different matter! Financial questions can be answered later. 
AQUARIUS, It's a good day for dialogue, which means that everyone attending interviews or important meetings should do well. You will have to rely more on your grasp of the facts and your ability to express yourself, and less on style, image or appearance. 
TAURUS, Relations and business associates are all likely to feel they have the right to make demands on your time, but they could be making a big mistake. You have given enough ground already. Don't let yourself be put upon any more: it's all a matter of knowing where to draw the line. 
GEMINI, You'll be a good listener. It's all too likely that what is now said or implied could seem unfair, unreasonable or unjust, yet it's all in the nature of the times that this should be so. It's just that some people like the sound of their own voices too much! CANCER You must do what you can to safeguard your position, yet this might have to be achieved while people around you are looking the other way! Colleagues are likely to pick up the wrong end of the stick at work but, if you're prepared, then nothing will knock you off your perch. 
LEO, Try to understand that certain individuals are misguided, and that this could be the reason why your rights are becoming an issue, or why ethical questions are becoming more important. For your part, you may concentrate on the larger picture, sparing a thought for where you'll be this time next month - or next year. 
VIRGO, Much has changed that you are not even aware of yet, but with your new-found confidence and ingenuity you will soon be in an ideal position to overcome all obstacles. Today's problems may be solved by throwing money at them. However, you have to find the right target first! 
LIBRA, After weeks when partners seemed to have the upper hand, you are at last beginning to see exactly how you can turn the tables on them. Your best approach is to be as subtle as you possibly can. Just don't let other people think that you're going behind their backs. 
SCORPIO, The ideal pattern to the day would be to have a lazy morning and a busy afternoon, so let's hope circumstances permit. Also, turn your attention to matters like exercise and diet to make sure you're treating yourself as well as you should. Remember - you only have one body! 
SAGITTARIUS, Try to inject a little of your legendary creative prowess into today's affairs and make enjoyability the main standard by which you measure and grade all activities. Give as much time as is needed for relationships with children, and a little more besides! 
CAPRICORN, You may be on the right track - or you may not. What is most important now, though, is not whether you're right or wrong, for nothing is black and white. Stop and think and consider what it is about your present activities that is good for you, and what should be improved. 
AQUARIUS, In view of changes in positive regions of your horoscope, even a major move or upheaval on the home front should be to your advantage in the long-term. In the short-term, though, a minor sacrifice may be necessary. Give a little now and you'll get more back later. 
TAURUS, You can only progress by off-loading certain responsibilities. One of your leading current planetary cycles was known in ancient times for bringing seclusion and meditation, so don't feel compelled to join in events you'd rather ignore. Mind you, you might have to have some good excuses ready. 
GEMINI, There is no point in hoping that imminent planetary aspects are about to remove your doubts, the simple reason being that doubts can be a very good thing! They are the warning signals sent by the sub-conscious to alert you to hazards ahead, so take heed. CANCER Life is full of curious twists and turns. If you now continue on a straight course, you may run into a few difficulties. Be true to your sign and remain ready to duck and weave as circumstances develop and even reliable partners change their minds. 
LEO, The overall picture becomes just that extra bit uncertain, but largely because the range of choice is now increasing. Although the solution to today's questions could be financial, take a look at your rights and make sure you're on solid ground. 
VIRGO, It will be difficult for you to continue to ignore all those warning signals, mainly because partners will get more and more emotional if they feel they are not being listened to. You could try humouring people who are upset, and waiting until the stress level drops. 
LIBRA, You're not convinced that partners know what they are doing, especially at home. However, bearing in mind that this is a moment to try out new ideas and experiment with domestic arrangements, be patient. You might even join in! At least you can offer constructive support. 
SCORPIO, The Moon is still in a relatively supportive relationship with your sign, which means that the highs should be higher and the lows briefer than usual. You should pay special attention to all creative ventures, searching out ways to express your unique talents. 
SAGITTARIUS, The accent is clearly on personal matters, and if you should suddenly discover masses of things to do outside the home, it could be that you're not facing up to reality. Actually, the solutions may be very simple. In fact, the answer may be staring you in the face! 
CAPRICORN, Place your own comfort and security above all else, because ultimately, unless you have a firm base, you won't feel free to develop your more adventurous schemes. And right now that's just what you should be doing. It may help to talk to people who have a more intuitive approach than you. 
AQUARIUS, Sometimes it takes an enormous amount of effort to get yourself out of a rut. Yet that's precisely what you should be doing at the moment. The trap you're in, though, is almost entirely to do with your low self-esteem, and you must understand the ways in which this stops you doing your best. 
TAURUS, Developments on the emotional or romantic fronts still seem to be veiled in secrecy. Perhaps it is you who are unable to reveal your feelings, but it could equally be partners who are being a little coy. At any rate, those underlying desires need to be gently teased out. 
GEMINI, At work you must still press ahead. Even though there is some time left, the opportunities to put a professional scheme into practice are diminishing. This is therefore no time to dither if your ambitions are on the line. Remember - life is not a rehearsal! CANCER The general pattern in your solar chart indicates that there is still no time like the present for pursuing lifelong ambitions. Forget that you were born under a sensitive sign and aim for the top. But there's one important word of advice: leave nothing to chance. 
LEO, Life still looks quite expensive. However, the time is rapidly approaching when you will be able to cease worrying about other people's money and security, and focus on your own. After all, when the chips are down, only you can really help yourself. And once you're better off, you'll be more use to others. 
VIRGO, The golden rule over the next forty-eight hours will be to listen to partners' advice. Even if they are apparently talking nonsense, you should smile intelligently and look interested. Amidst the ninety-nine which are irrelevant, there may be a one per cent nugget of pure, golden truth. 
LIBRA, Keep yourself busy, but also pay a little extra attention to your physical well-being. This is actually that time of the month when it's auspicious for you to sort out your exercise regime and rearrange your diet. The first step is to make sure that you pace yourself, balancing hard work with serious relaxation. 
SCORPIO, Have yourself an enjoyable day. You may be obliged to work or perform burdensome routine tasks but, even so, with just a slight change of attitude you can realise that what you are doing has a positive side. You need to base your initiatives and actions on firm foundations, so walk before you run. 
SAGITTARIUS, Home and domestic affairs will almost inevitably intrude on your life more than you would wish. Probably the best thing you can do is cheerfully devote extra time and attention wherever required. There's no point in sticking your head in the sand, or being resentful. 
CAPRICORN, You are soon to receive another boost from magical Mercury. See this as a period for fresh ideas, conjuring up new dreams and letting your imagination lead you to the future. Ask other people about their plans, and see if there's anything you can imitate! 
AQUARIUS, It's a day for handling money, and that means spending it as well as earning it. Your most extravagant and unrestrained planetary alignments are not due just yet, so you should end up in profit. On the other hand, a family member's plea for extra cash may be irresistible! 
TAURUS, You never believed that you would have everything all your own way, but you should try not to be put out by the fact that other people are inclined to oppose your plans, or by the ease with which they seem to win the argument. It is time for you to put partners in first place and take a minor role yourself. 
GEMINI, Jupiter, the great ruler of good fortune, is moving your way, so you can afford to be optimistic about the future. This noble planet has been playing a complicated game and although you have had good reason to feel let down lately you must keep your confidence up. You will receive your rewards soon! CANCER This is a relatively quiet time astrologically, although the Moon is encouraging partners to stand up for themselves, and that might present you with one or two headaches! One good piece of news is that Venus, planet of love and romance, is now making a positive aspect to your sign. 
LEO, Now that Mercury has taken up a supportive and friendly relationship with your sign, you will find it much easier to take decisions and reach agreement on issues that have until now been difficult to resolve. The Moon will be helpfully aligned for much of the week, so use your time to get family affairs in order. 
VIRGO, The pressure at home should definitely be easing up by now. If you still feel that tensions are high, don't worry. Now that Saturn is moving on and Jupiter is about to change its position, you can afford to be confident that events will work out in your favour. This is due in part to your skilful organization. 
LIBRA, This could be an argumentative period, not something that you would normally relish. However, if you take a little care in your relationships, refusing to rise to other people's provocation then, in your turn, you will give them no cause to complain about your behavior. 
SCORPIO, Just as Mercury, the planet of wit and repartee, makes one set of aspects, so Venus, the ruler of love, forms another. You may find that you're a lot less concerned with what partners think, and much more aware of how they feel! In other words, you have no reason to complain that Fate is out to do you down. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is an excellent time to take decisions, attend interviews, suggest proposals and generally sell your ideas on all subjects to anybody who is prepared to give you a hearing. You, more than anybody, will benefit from brilliant planetary aspects and may well secure a partner's support for a new plan. 
CAPRICORN, Many astrologers believe that you are a conservative and cautious person. How wrong they are! In fact, your current crop of Solar and Lunar alignments suggests that you will be prepared to push yourself to the front of the queue, laying your ambitions on the line. 
AQUARIUS, You should try paying a little more attention to your career and worldly ambitions, and communicate with the people who can help you achieve them. Although your general pattern for the year indicates great independence, this week is no time to go it alone if other people are queuing up to help you. 
TAURUS, Mercury, the planet which represents your mind, has now entered a theatrical region of your chart, which means that for the next fortnight you may cut quite a dash with your ideas. It's all a question of having confidence - and of not being easily embarrassed. 
GEMINI, If you can take care of personal relationships with smooth and unflappable efficiency then you'll give yourself enough time to deal with financial matters later on. In fact, this is going to be a rather good time for picking up valuable bargains. CANCER You may get all routine chores out of the way before you turn to personal matters. For some strange reason partners will respect you more if they see that you are efficient, organised and practical! That might not always have been the case, but you must allow people to change! 
LEO, Something - or someone - is encouraging you to take a risk. The question is whether this is now appropriate, and the answer is an unequivocal ‘maybe'! The way to clear up any doubts is to give yourself as much time as you need to run through each and every possible outcome. 
VIRGO, Just because your ideas are the best, that doesn't give you the excuse to preach or impose your opinions on others. The secret now is to be quite discreet, confident in the knowledge that you have the future worked out. The best way to be proved right is to set a good example. 
LIBRA, Your behaviour at the moment seems to be slightly contradictory. You are very open with your feelings, but you're keeping some of your plans and intentions to yourself. Don't be surprised if partners should be confused. It's only to be expected! 
SCORPIO, The romantic situation seems to be dominated by secrecy for another few weeks at least. Something is going to happen to stir up feelings which you find it difficult to talk about, so you may just wait for the emotional waters to clear. You'll find the right words eventually. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you're considering any financial adventures today, even a humble shopping trip, your stars begin to look very much more businesslike as the hours pass. Early on, though, there's a chance that extravagance will have overwhelmed good sense. Your generosity of spirit will be one of your better qualities. 
CAPRICORN, If you should consider cancelling any social engagements, give yourself time to think again. The point is that, as the Moon weaves among the other planets, you are likely to change your mind, and what once seemed like a waste of time will once again look like a welcome opportunity. 
AQUARIUS, Make a point of spending a little time by yourself, and don't let anyone persuade you that day-dreaming is a pointless activity. By letting your imagination wander, you will stumble across the answer to a few unsolved problems, with very worthwhile results. 
TAURUS, As the hours pass your mood will gradually become more adventurous. This could mean that personal plans go through a certain amount of chopping and changing. Any opportunity to travel may be seized with open arms. After all, you never know what you might find. 
GEMINI, It seems inevitable that you will have to play the game according to partners' rules. If they shift the goal posts, there may be little that you can do about it. Take the only choice possible and put loved ones' interests first! You'll receive your reward later. CANCER It certainly looks like a day to keep busy and to make sure that every single detail is dealt with before you go on to tackle larger schemes. There is, by the way, much to be said for keeping a low profile in relationships - and don't give anyone reason to moan or complain. 
LEO, If financial affairs have been confused lately, you're about to begin to see the wood for the trees. And, as if by magic, life will start to make very much more sense. Within the next week, facts and figures which once seemed meaningless will take on a new light. 
VIRGO, The shift now taking place in your monthly cycles indicates that you may not feel as in tune with your intuitions as you have in the recent past. You'll have to explain yourself to people in future, rather than hoping that they'll read your mind. 
LIBRA, You are now beginning to look more confident, and in many situations it's your social graces which will carry you through. However, you will still be troubled by the belief that others are keeping certain information from you. The best advice is to keep your own counsel for now. 
SCORPIO, Your social stars are looking extremely powerful. What is very pleasing for you, though, is that you'll be able to indulge your passionate nature over the coming weeks, extending your desire for mystery and secret trysts. Just don't give anyone else the idea that you're letting them down. 
SAGITTARIUS, A partner's support is bound to give you more confidence, but your feelings will be rather unsteady. If you realise that unexpected events are likely to affect your emotions, you'll be well-prepared. And if someone springs a surprise on you, take it in the spirit in which it's meant. 
CAPRICORN, Spend as much time by yourself as you like, and don't let others dragoon you into joining in any sort of group activity against your will, least of all collective fun. Everything has to be done in your own time, and only when you are good and ready. 
AQUARIUS, You are far too willing to make value judgments at the moment. You must understand that, even though there are many issues about which you feel very strongly, this may be no time to impose your own moral standards. It is much more important that you watch, listen and learn from others. 
TAURUS, Financial pressures will soon rise once again, but this time it's joint connections which need sorting out. If you're dealing with someone else's money, or they're handling yours, take all the necessary precautions. At home, you now have another chance to improve relationships with children and younger relatives. 
GEMINI, Home and family affairs are central to your thinking, and no future plan will succeed unless you are careful to consult relations, and everyone else you live with, as widely as possible. After all, if they say ‘yes' now, they won't be able to complain later. CANCER You can still act behind the scenes if you wish, but the mood of the times is gradually changing. Right now the best thing you can do is talk to as many people as possible about what your next step should be, and when you should take it. Pick your time with care. 
LEO, Your confidence is liable to slip without warning, but never imagine that all is lost, or that you are doomed to failure. It is all a matter of being as patient as possible, and allowing certain long-term problems to iron themselves out. Can you turn the clock back? Perhaps - but only briefly. 
VIRGO, You may now show yourself in your true colours, and that might involve risking a disagreement with someone who is close to you. Both financially and at work you may assume more authority by showing that you know what you're talking about. And about time, too! 
LIBRA, The mood should be growing lighter by the day, although secret fears still trouble you. One positive way to use your current planetary patterns is to delve into all those timeless mystical and spiritual mysteries. If you get a sense of life's underlying purpose then you'll be able to rearrange your priorities so that they suit you better. 
SCORPIO, Now you have most of the information at your fingertips, you can afford to take the lead socially. For some time you have been irritated by others' tendency to push themselves forward, but now you can take the limelight. Please do so with your usual diplomacy! 
SAGITTARIUS, You can afford to put your foot down at home, even if other people don't like it. The Moon's role in your chart reveals that you have the advantage, and it will be a rare person who can call your bluff. What should you do? Be flexible and be prepared for last-minute changes. 
CAPRICORN, Your private and professional lives are linked in a way which defies analysis: before you can explore new career opportunities, you need to work out where you stand in relation to an emotional tie. And when business and pleasure mix, you'll have to work out where your loyalties lie. 
AQUARIUS, You should be very sure indeed to check all legal plans extremely carefully. There is nothing to be gained from allowing standards to slip, and everything to be achieved by keeping them as high as possible, especially in matters of the heart. 
TAURUS, At home it looks very much as if partners have the stronger hand, and if they insist on doing things their way, you might as well let them. After all, it can be relaxing to let other people take the strain. You can remain behind the scenes, providing sympathy and support. 
GEMINI, All your instincts should be telling you to delay finalising important transactions, at least until you've had time to absorb all the facts. The point is that circumstances have changed, and your most personal plans must therefore be duly amended. CANCER All financial or business matters now need to be viewed in a new light, mainly because what once seemed so certain, is yet again a matter of dispute. At home, the pressing need is now for more luxury! At the very least other people need to be pulling their own weight. 
LEO, A decidedly tricky relationship between one family member and another could spring a few surprises on you, especially where it hurts - in your pocket! Tread very carefully at work, sticking to the straight and narrow at all times. If you bend the rules you might get caught out! 
VIRGO, You may think long and hard before changing direction in midstream. It may be best to continue with a course of action which was initiated at the beginning of the month, or even earlier. There'll be time enough for a change of plan in about five weeks' time. 
LIBRA, The Moon is matched with an intense and passionate part of your chart, a region connected closely with money. At the heart of financial issues, though, is the extent to which you have managed to consistently undervalue your own worth. Change your approach now. 
SCORPIO, If you feel vulnerable, it's because the Moon is spending a few days aligned with your sign, raising the emotional temperature. As long as you understand that you're likely to feel up one moment, down the next, and then up again, nothing will take you by surprise. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have become more determined to make a success of yourself, to be somebody. It doesn't matter what your current ambition is, just as long as you accept nothing less than first place. You need to trawl through all the available possibilities, ready to make your move when the time comes. 
CAPRICORN, Venus is sailing along quite happily through a region of your chart which is related to professional ambitions, indicating that the route to worldly success lies in exploiting all personal contacts to the hilt. Whatever you're doing, do your best. 
AQUARIUS, Your dominant romantic influence indicates long-distance love, so ideally you should be travelling to far-away places. Your heart will soon be stirred by people from cultures very different from your own. Or perhaps a person already close to you develops a new interest - and a fascinating allure. 
TAURUS, The key to the moment is pleasure. This doesn't mean that life should be one endless party, but that you should make a point of enjoying everything you do, including the most routine chores. This is not an impossible dream - and it's also one of the best ways to increase your quality of life. 
GEMINI, Some people around you seem far too lively at the moment, but they're living in the past, not the present. It's about time they woke up and realised that the correct question to ask is: 'where do we go from here?' If a dialogue is necessary then it may be up to you to get it going. CANCER You must understand that once you have got your own way a certain number of times, it is up to you to encourage others to take first place. The difficulty is judging when it is the best moment to make the switch and, for this, an impeccable sense of timing is now required. 
LEO, Not everything is as it appears. In fact, surprising as it may seem, to some people, your sense of self-esteem can suffer as much as anybody's. Now is a good moment to look at ways in which family members have eroded your confidence, even unintentionally, and do something about it. 
VIRGO, There are right decisions and there are wrong decisions. Sometimes there is a grey area in the middle, but at the moment the choices seem to be polarised, and you may have to come off the fence and commit yourself. Some people would say that it's about time! 
LIBRA, It's all very well imagining that you can compromise for ever, but if you don't act to secure your happiness, nobody else will. Romantically, it's up to you to take the initiative as soon as possible. There may be hidden costs, but that's always a risk. 
SCORPIO, If you're planning activities for the future, go for anything which is guaranteed to be sociable. Bear in mind that as the months pass your desires will change, and what makes sense now will be very different indeed, so build in a little flexibility. 
SAGITTARIUS, It looks as if you are about to reach a point of no return professionally, or in any major ambition, even a leisure activity, which is designed to secure praise and recognition. It all now depends on what you know, and you can no longer rely on personal contacts. 
CAPRICORN, The very fact that your planetary aspects are so few and far between is enough to convince anyone that what is important now is that you begin to shape your own future. Start to make long-term plans, allowing daily details to sort themselves out. 
AQUARIUS, There are strong suggestions that your social life is set for some improvements. This time around, a friend or acquaintance is also due to boost your financial prospects, but you must be prepared to take the lead. There's nothing to be gained from sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring. 
TAURUS, Your solar chart is beginning to look considerably more relaxed, which means that if you have any lingering problems to cope with, they will be caused by yesterday's questions and difficulties, rather than today's. Mind you, you've got to keep a clear head. 
GEMINI, Although you've been cracking along at a fair old pace recently, it will soon be time to take stock, and perhaps go over old ground again. Stay alert and keep an eye on fortune's subtle ebb and flow. Opportunities will come and go, but you'll have to be quick off the mark. CANCER Domestic affairs matter most at the moment. This could be an extremely useful period to get in touch with family members you've not seen for some time. And it's certainly a good moment to see that all your favourite ambitions are based on firm foundations. 
LEO, It's a day for taking choices, although whether you are truly in any state to make important long-term decisions is another matter! You can make your mind up, but following your intentions through may not be so simple. If current issues focus around money, and how to get more of it, you're probably on the right track. 
VIRGO, You are entering what can only be described as a more settled period for affairs of the heart. The question is whether recent opportunities on the field of romance can be followed up, or are to be left on the scrap-heap of history. The truth may emerge after another few days have passed. 
LIBRA, Emotional confidence is returning, but the planets advise a small dose of caution. It may be difficult to practice restraint, but you'll know when the moment is right to hold back. It's all a matter of trusting your instincts, although that's not an easy thing at the best of times. 
SCORPIO, You can afford to keep your intentions and feelings to yourself for a little while longer. The question, though, is whether, when the moment does come to reveal all, you will be able to choose the time and the place. If you can, all well and good. 
SAGITTARIUS, You are often torn between a sociable desire to involve other people in your affairs on the one hand, and a strangely solitary urge to go off and do your own thing on the other. Although the latter is very important over the next few months, the former should take precedence today. 
CAPRICORN, The overall picture now becomes very much more certain, and, to your relief, less confused. The message of the moment is a rather profound one: it's not what's true that counts as much as what you believe to be true. You'd also do well to give others the benefit of the doubt, at least until they've had time to explain themselves. 
AQUARIUS, The past month seems to have coincided with a time of flared passions and tense situations, often over matters which could easily have been avoided. If professional ambitions have been disturbed you'll soon find it easy to make up. Private disputes require a little more attention, though. 
TAURUS, You may appear calm but in fact you are driven by a deep, burning desire - and only you know about it! On balance you are now in an excellent position to achieve a worldly ambition and to attract much applause, although personal aspirations may be harder to pin down. 
GEMINI, It's a week of ups and downs. If you have accidentally upset anyone recently, you will doubtless be able to make handsome amends very soon. Magnetic Mars, by the way, is now speeding along very nicely, boosting your energy and giving you a valuable, and long overdue, shot in the arm. CANCER The personal sphere is looking changeable. Partnerships still seem slightly sticky, but I'm sure you'll work it out. Get money matters resolved sooner rather than later and leave yourself plenty of time for taking odd trips and organising family celebrations. 
LEO, You should prepare to experience some warmth, hope and good feeling. The Sun and Jupiter are aligned in a manner which is utterly heart warming, but I must warn you that, if you're over-optimistic, partners may get the feeling that you're being a little too arrogant. 
VIRGO, Responsibility is the name of the game this week! You have duties on your mind and trying to walk the straight and narrow is just up your street! However, whereas you're now inclined to rein yourself in, in interesting areas of your life, you seem set to let rip. 
LIBRA, There's something strange happening with communications this week. Messages could be delayed or muddled, but not because of any ill intentions. The reality is that you can't rely on the facts, and neither can anyone else. At home, as in every area of your life, you'll have to edge your way forward with sensitivity. 
SCORPIO, You should be looking ahead very eagerly, now. Most of the planets are grouped in personal regions of your horoscope, which means that much of what you accomplish should be important to you and you alone. There's nothing wrong with being selfish  at least, not for a short while. 
SAGITTARIUS, Things rarely happen in this world just when we want them to, but this should hardly worry you. Concentrate on things which are far away or adventurous. If you can possibly arrange a trip to an exciting place, please do so. And also develop your interest in unusual subjects - you never know what you're going to discover. 
CAPRICORN, Come out of your shell. It's time to show us all your sparkling wit and repartee. You may doubt your verbal skills, but according to your stars you'll be able to persuade almost anybody of virtually anything. You may even be able to wrap the most sceptical people around your little finger. 
AQUARIUS, Do not panic if you feel that too many things are out of control. In spite of appearances, you have more influence over events than you sometimes think, and must accept responsibility for whatever happens. Don't worry about money too much, as you are about to enter a highly prosperous phase. 
TAURUS, You are not regarded as a natural nomad, but one way or another your stars do seem to be rather unsettling. So, although today's planets favour a domesticated life, do what you can to make your home that much more colourful! Keep busy but don't let partners exploit your goodwill. 
GEMINI, It may come as a surprise to you that the sign of the zodiac responsible for your legendary talkativeness, is Leo. That is why your current colourful planets are trying to tell you to get out and meet as many people as you possibly can, as soon as you can. CANCER Take as much time and expend as much effort as is necessary to repair a damaged relationship. Even if a personal rupture seems to be for the good, don't imagine for one moment that it is all done and finished with! Whatever happens now could take a new twist in three months' time. 
LEO, As if by magic, the Moon comes to your rescue, helping you make up your mind. This happens once a month, but this time around the change in your mood could be quite dramatic and, over the next few days, you could experience a sudden surge of confidence and optimism. 
VIRGO, After a brief social spell you may be ready to spend a little time by yourself. Actually, it will be a good idea to re-charge your emotional batteries ready for what should be a fine start to the coming week. If you're keeping a secret, you may blurt it out tomorrow. 
LIBRA, One thing you can say about the recent past is that at least your skills in crisis management have been refined and, in some cases, wrought to perfection. Now you may relax and enjoy any pleasant social encounters conferred by the Moon in friendly regions of your chart. 
SCORPIO, Play to win today. There can be no coming second place, whether your goals are professional, financial or romantic. At the very least you should aim to exceed your own personal best. Some people say that it's more important to compete than come top, but you could still do with some extra applause! 
SAGITTARIUS, Today's energetic Moon is just the ingredient required to make the whole world seem a much more compatible place. After today, you should begin to feel more comfortable with the direction that life, especially on the personal level, is going. 
CAPRICORN, The fact that there is so little new taking place in your chart today should come as a relief, for you should be able to begin to digest the many lessons still to be learnt from recent upsets and opportunities. The next two months, by the way, present extraordinarily good opportunities in all areas. Couldn't be better! 
AQUARIUS, Listen very carefully indeed to partners' little words of wisdom. They may be critical, but the fact is that you stand in need of truthful comment about what you are doing wrong - as well as praise for what you are doing right. You may even soon have cause to thank a rival! 
TAURUS, It is absolutely and definitely time to take an overview of all your affairs, both the overtly public and the intensely personal. Consider your plans and actions from a moral perspective, and see if there is room for improvement. I'm sure there is. 
GEMINI, It's a day of potential tumult and turbulence for almost everybody. You are more likely to be an onlooker than a direct participant, in which case your Geminian wisdom will be much appreciated by those who are locked in emotional battles, with themselves - and with you. CANCER You have a simple choice. Either you must throw yourself into whatever is happening, even if changeable, with 110% commitment. Or you may stay at the sidelines. However, if you choose to stand aloof, circumstances may well force your hand at last. 
LEO, Someone, somewhere, is thinking of you. You never know - getting in touch with people you haven't seen for a long time could be a very pleasant way to spend your energy. You may have a few doubts but it's perfectly acceptable to seek reassurance from people you trust. 
VIRGO, Responsibilities for children and younger relatives could be among those duties which have been tying you down. However, the psychological lesson for all Virgos is to return to and begin to question certain aspects of your childhood conditioning. 
LIBRA, One of the best ways to get on with family members is to share their ambitions. The more interest you show in them, the more they'll show in you, and a way will be found to settle current dilemmas and disputes. And if there's anything else you want to get going - and I mean anything - now is the time. 
SCORPIO, Watch out for legal complications, and always act only out of the highest of motives. In matters concerning you and you alone, do whatever you wish, but if others are involved you must consider their position very carefully indeed. You're in one of your secretive moods, but don't let anyone think you're going behind their back. 
SAGITTARIUS, While events are moving as fast as they are, there may be little you can do to influence the situation. However, what does lie in your hands is an ability to change your attitudes and preconceptions, so try to see what exactly it is within you which sometimes causes you to tip your material resources down the drain! 
CAPRICORN, An approaching lunar pattern could be one of the most important planetary happenings in your chart for some time. This doesn't mean that the earth is going to move - although it could do. What is more important is a sense of opportunity and an awareness of possibilities which should begin to infect your life. 
AQUARIUS, You may be a little confused as to why work and other routine activities seem to require a return to the past. It's not necessarily that mistakes were made, just that you still have certain lessons to learn. Tie up lingering loose ends and you'll feel a whole lot better. 
TAURUS, The planetary clarion call is to be adventurous. However, for many of you, three areas of your life stand out: legal questions, travel plans and higher education. In all these matters you should take very detailed notice of your own situation and set out to offer others a helping hand. 
GEMINI, Don't be confused by the fact that money seems to be so important. The vital issue now is your value system, and the judgments you make both on yourself and other people. Try to be aware of the ways in which this is shaping your relationships. CANCER You seem to be suffering from a strange desire to rake over the coals, fanning the flames of some old argument or dispute. Whether you go ahead or not is your choice, but it may be worth looking at the possible consequences before you make a start. 
LEO, From your solar chart it looks as if you are entering the realms of imagination and mystery which take you further into your dreams than ever before. Watch out for confusion in the so-called real world and take care at work, but enjoy your fantasies. 
VIRGO, It is artistic Virgos who are best fitted to survive the week - and find the success you all deserve. You may not count yourself amongst this select group, but you'd be wrong. There are a hundred and one ways to develop your untapped creative potential, so get on with it! 
LIBRA, It is impossible to tell whether it is home and family life or professional and worldly ambitions which require the most attention. All that is certain is that twenty-six hours in the day are not sufficient to deal with all that you have on your plate. 
SCORPIO, Whatever you do, select an adventurous path. Don't take risks, but do extend yourself in areas as yet unknown to you. In some strange way an overseas connection, perhaps from the past, is about to acquire an increasing significance. Perhaps the world will come knocking at your door. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your own finances are inextricably linked to other people's and the consequences right now seem to be two-fold. First, you must realise that your actions will have a profound effect on other people. Second, there may be some developments which lie ultimately outside your control. 
CAPRICORN, For the fourth day running you can benefit from inspired planetary alignments but you may also be somewhat muddled, if only because new options are opening up. Your best policy is to be as adaptable as possible, for if you bend with the wind you should do very well indeed. 
AQUARIUS, It is time to take your physical state in hand, making sure that you have enough relaxation and that you are getting the diet and exercise appropriate to your circumstances. Get in shape for the future now and hang on to - or restore - your youth. 
TAURUS, In all personal relationships one of the most important considerations is how other people value you. It is more than likely that you have been taken for granted, and this must now be stopped. Try to improve relationships with children - you should find them particularly responsive. 
GEMINI, By now you must be aware that your financial situation is in a state of flux. The best advice may be to allow the process of change to continue and not to attempt any fresh arrangements until you are absolutely certain that events have come to rest. CANCER With a little luck you will soon come that much closer to understanding exactly what it is that makes someone else tick. It's no use taking surface appearances seriously, for what is truly essential will be concealed from view. You're about to take an important decision, so keep a clear head. 
LEO, One of the most useful things you can do at the moment is make a careful note of any strange dreams. The plain truth is that your unconscious mind is in turmoil, digesting and processing changes in your everyday life including, for many of you, developments at work. 
VIRGO, Socially you seem to be returning to the past. It is almost as if you have unfinished business, perhaps from long ago, which now needs to be attended to. Certainly, a sentimental journey could help you establish your roots, and restore a link with the past. 
LIBRA, You are beginning to feel the strain at work, and at home, as the need to balance opposing desires, commitments and people begins to tell. It will do you good to cease basing your actions on self-interest, and look at all matters anew through your ethical spectacles! 
SCORPIO, You have thought long and hard about what you need from a particular relationship, and it may finally be time to see if you are going to get it. Once you swing into action you must be prepared to change your plans at a moment's notice, so stay alert. 
SAGITTARIUS, Probably the most sensible thing you can do is to pay very careful attention to criticism and comments from friends and partners. It may be painful to admit you were wrong, but essential nonetheless! Plus, partners will respect your honesty. And about time, too! 
CAPRICORN, Whatever the uncertainty or confusion you face at the moment, it is essential to keep a track of details today. Everything that happens and every word that people speak, contribute to the larger picture, so you must stay awake. A legal problem should be settled, soon. 
AQUARIUS, Although this is a reasonable moment for speculation, it is the worst possible time to gamble. Your judgment will be so coloured by vague hopes and fears that it will be impossible to make a reasoned decision. Concentrate on developing the poetry in your soul. 
TAURUS, Check out your financial situation. It's likely that your choices might be greater than you think, both in terms of what you can do to maximise your earnings, and what can be done to pick up a bargain or two. One thing is certain - and it's that you need respect. Will it come? It depends on you! 
GEMINI, By the time you wake up this morning the Moon should have embarked on a new and beneficial cycle. Above all, try to get a fix on events at home, and insist that your wishes be obeyed! Partners who think that they can get away with anything will soon learn how wrong they are. CANCER Over the next forty-eight hours you should aim to spend as much time as possible by yourself. The aim is not just to be alone, but to give yourself the space for your imagination to drift off and come back with the answer to a current dilemma. At work, look after all those little facts, or you'll miss a vital detail. 
LEO, You could be increasingly troubled by vague fears and imagined spectres. Some may have a grounding in reality, but all will be largely shaped by your imagination. Such worries will be dealt with all the more easily if you admit that they are there and bring them out into the open. 
VIRGO, Choices, choices, choices! How tired you get of having to make up your mind - and then make other people&#039;s minds up for them as well! Unfortunately, it does seem inevitable that you must now decide between two completely different ways of putting your ambitions into action. 
LIBRA, Travel looms. That's not to say that you'll be going anywhere at the moment, but if you can plan a future journey now, you'll be doing yourself a big favour and setting yourself a target to work towards. You've still got your secrets, but all that will change before long. 
SCORPIO, The financial sector of your solar horoscope has been in an inspired, if dubious, situation for some years now, so it should come as no surprise to find that once again you're heading for a monetary roller-coaster. This time you should know what to do about it! 
SAGITTARIUS, The golden rule in business is always to think first - and spend later. Your tendency at the moment is to act impulsively, taking only instant impressions into account, but at a time when there could be so much at stake, you should be a little more cautious. 
CAPRICORN, In all personal relationships the rule is to trust other people only when they've shown what they're made of. This is not because anyone is out to mislead you, but because appearances are not what they seem. Your intuitive antennae should be working overtime. 
AQUARIUS, The best approach to professional and organisational hassles is to be as creative as possible. This means being prepared to break with routine and insist that your own personal skills take precedence over traditional ways of doing things. But will other people listen? I hope so! 
TAURUS, The Moon begins the week in a supportive position, a symbolic indication that you hold the advantage. This is undoubtedly a very useful moment, one in which your main task should be to rearrange family and domestic routines to suit you, rather than other people. 
GEMINI, On a day when so many people will be tempted to blurt things out uncontrollably, you seem quite uncharacteristically prepared to keep certain information close to your chest. Save the best for tomorrow! By the way, I should mention that even though this is a time for decisions, you don't have to make up your mind today. CANCER By far and away the most important factor in your chart at the moment is Mars' slightly uncertain motion. This celestial activity is due to present you with different alternatives and might even take you back to the past, offering a valuable chance to remedy old mistakes. 
LEO, You may spare a little time at least for your more ambitious activities. Professional Leos will have their hands full at work but, for those of you with more time, it is the moment to take a special interest one stage further. Employers and people in authority should respect your creative skills. 
VIRGO, Consider yourself fortunate to be born under a sign whose qualities include common sense. This is a commodity which will be greatly lacking this week in the world as a whole, and you are well placed to avoid the pitfalls eagerly awaiting your fellow humans! 
LIBRA, Generous Jupiter is making its way through a challenging region of your chart for a little while longer, but there comes a time when this planet's sense of infinite possibilities must be galvanised. Such a time is now, so don't hold yourself back, no matter whether your forte is love, work or making money. 
SCORPIO, The week opens with a challenge, a sympathetic one it has to be said, from the Moon to your sign, a certain indication that you will have to deal with a little criticism from partners. And a good thing too! After all, where would you be if nobody had ever told you where you were going wrong? 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a perfect Monday-ish sort of a start to the week in that you seem prepared to cope with all those mundane, tedious, routine chores. However, behind the scenes lurks the potential for disruption later on! Mind you, perhaps you will welcome the chance to change your mind. 
CAPRICORN, Everything you do today should be in essence a preparation for the next few weeks of dramatic lunar alignments. You may be tempted to take grand initiatives, and could well be a mite too optimistic about the outcome. Still, it will pay to experiment a little. 
AQUARIUS, Get the week off to an efficient start by dealing with home and family questions. Be as practical as possible, and watch out for a brief spat of emotional trouble around late afternoon: do your best to allay relatives' suspicions or fears! 
TAURUS, Some of your planets are certainly in a belligerent mood. Actually, you're now moving rapidly through a turbulent and stormy set of lunar alignments. It's a strange fact, though, that unsettling astrological conditions can be great fun for all those who are ready and willing to take a chance. 
GEMINI, One door closes, and another opens. Very soon Mercury, which just happens to be your ruling planet, makes a fresh encounter with Pluto, the ruler of deep and unfathomable emotions. Be prepared for strange dreams and visions of how life could be. Avoid regrets for the past. CANCER Venus still seems to be among the strongest planets in your horoscope, a factor which is largely responsible for your continuing good fortune. The key to the present period is to be found in the support and encouragement you receive from close and intimate partners. 
LEO, Now that the planets are adopting a challenging position, a degree of confrontation is probably inescapable. However, astrology is all about making the most of our gifts to avert conflict. If you refuse to make mountains out of emotional molehills everyone will gain - and you'll be so much the wiser. 
VIRGO, Sometimes your planets are at peace  and such a time is now. A reassuring relationship between Mercury and Uranus is bound to make you feel better in spite of the fact that some associates may be stirring up matters which are none of their business. You'll be coming up with some fascinating ideas. 
LIBRA, Look on the bright side. You've had your share of problems at work, but quite honestly your current professional stars couldn't be better. As far as family and home affairs are concerned, Friday and Saturday are unquestionably the days to get to grips with all those most important practical tasks. 
SCORPIO, The Sun, Mars and Pluto are still related to each other in a pattern that is about as impulsive, reckless and reluctant to compromise as it's possible to imagine. Get things off your chest by all means, but don't bite off more than you can chew unless you're ready for the consequences. 
SAGITTARIUS, Work is not easy at the moment  but nobody ever said it would be. A challenge can actually be character-forming! You may be over-burdened or suffering from the resentment of associates. On the other hand, there's an enormous amount to be gained from pursuing your ambitions flat out. 
CAPRICORN, Life is improving, bit by bit. The Moon spends the end of the week aligned with your sign, which means that this is the best time to tackle those outstanding domestic issues. In addition, family members may give you a chance to take some time off. 
AQUARIUS, There's a very important set of lunar movements coming up. Some of you will be rushed off your feet by an emotional or social whirlwind. Others may be plucking up the courage to reveal a few home truths. Compromise over details but not over your principles. 
TAURUS, You may be squeezed between two conflicting trends; one a desire to get to grips with the facts, the other a realisation that the truth lies in your imagination rather than in the real world. Such a dilemma implies that extreme caution is the best policy. 
GEMINI, For a short time mystery is in the air, and today's planetary picture could add a new twist. Your Mercurial talents are ideally suited to digging out the truth, and there seems little doubt that this will turn out to be much stranger than you ever imagined. CANCER Although there will be difficult times, partners will offer you succour and protection over the coming weeks. Today, though, a mystery will intensify, perhaps clouding your vision and obscuring the facts. Why, you ask yourself, can't people just get on with each other? 
LEO, You are supposed to be a generous partner, yet in the final analysis you're much too keen on your own ideas to really be able to agree or compromise with people who have opposing views. This stubborn attitude may be out of place today, so don't force issues which should be left well alone. 
VIRGO, Perhaps it's just that you've been overworking but a long holiday is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition. Yet, even if you do get away, you will take your professional concerns with you. Perhaps you're just looking for a way out from emotional stress! 
LIBRA, A challenging alignment from Venus to Mars encourages strange and little-known influences, which in turn stimulates your emotional desires but promotes caution. You would be advised to stand your ground, though - but never fight a battle you can't win. 
SCORPIO, Partners must, repeat must, be involved in your financial thinking, even though it may not be the easiest thing in the world to make yourself understood. Is someone now being deliberately obtuse? Or do they just lack your depth of wisdom and understanding? 
SAGITTARIUS, You may now be tiring of the endless opposition to your plans and ideas. But has it occurred to you that there may be a great deal of good, sound commonsense in what other people have to say? And that is precisely why you must avoid confrontation today and tomorrow. 
CAPRICORN, Mars is still challenging your sign, guaranteeing lively times, even though you will have to put up with other people's unhelpful or demanding behaviour. Be sure to reach a compromise if this is the only way to gain acceptance. You may be worried that someone is undermining your interests, but don't jump to conclusions. 
AQUARIUS, Like your fellow air signs, the Librans and Geminians, you are enjoying the benefits of a seemingly endless series of wonderful planetary influences. If events don't work out as planned, it is because you have seriously mishandled them. Make up for it now. 
TAURUS, Your business and financial activities, whether real or potential, are becoming ever more complex. Busy times lie ahead and routine chores will therefore mount up. Social introductions should be interesting, and you may fall under someone's spell. 
GEMINI, Romantic affairs still figure strongly in your calculations, although today's influences in this respect may catch you by surprise. Unfortunately, partners who envy your success may be in a fault-finding mood. You may have to play the martyr, just to placate them! CANCER Partners who are in an argumentative mood will be out of step today. If anyone in your vicinity is upset then be quick to cheer them up, settling disputes and freeing the way for everyone to move on to more constructive avenues. Once you are sure of your next step, please seek support from partners. 
LEO, Professional issues are brought into focus by a series of planets aligned with your tenth and sixth solar houses, especially if you are in the habit of overworking and tiring yourself out. Take it easy if you want to make the most of positive and daring romantic trends. 
VIRGO, There is no doubt that the Sun's relationship with Venus and Jupiter in suitably ambitious sectors of your solar chart creates brilliant and idealistic possibilities today. It is up to you to set the pace and turn events to your own unique advantage. 
LIBRA, There will indeed be some pressure to make positive career changes, but you'll be able to rely on powerful planetary influences to push you in the right direction. Status may be more important than monetary rewards, yet that doesn't mean that cash concerns should be overlooked. 
SCORPIO, As a Scorpio you are by nature deeply motivated by your beliefs. Partners will be impressed if you share your profound insights and ideas, and keep them up to date with your plans for the future. The weekend's arguments could focus on money - and who owes whom what! 
SAGITTARIUS, Even though it may be out of character, plotting ways to earn more money has become one of your favourite activities, even if your ideas seldom move beyond the planning stage. If you're spending cash today, gadgets to help with a healthier lifestyle could be a good buy. 
CAPRICORN, Even if you're in a secretive mood today, as long as the Moon is aligned with romantic and creative sectors, social and romantic opportunities abound and you'll appreciate considerate and loving behaviour from partners. Take the lead and show how generous you can be now that you're so much more experienced. 
AQUARIUS, Mercury's relationship with the foundation of your horoscope means that changes in the home may require more thought, although you'll probably be impatient with anybody who stands in your way. It would be a shame if arguments over who does what spoiled your weekend - so don't let them! 
TAURUS, Once again, you have the chance to make up your mind. Don't allow others to influence your judgment. Your most precious possession at the moment is your ability to take decisions which are both logically and instinctively correct, no matter what other people say. 
GEMINI, Mercury, planet of wit and wisdom, is suggesting that you feel the need to get to grips with profound deep psychological questions. You are becoming more familiar with the deep motivations that direct your daily affairs. Gradually, you're more and more aware of influences you never dreamt existed. CANCER Mars is an excitable planet, and its presence reveals that there might have been an almighty bust-up recently. Perhaps you were called upon to restore order, and you should soon find yourself back in favour with people whose opinion of you matters a great deal. Still, when the chips are down, you have no choice but to stand up for yourself. 
LEO, Challenging planetary aspects recently have fired your imagination and made it plain that there's only one person who can guarantee your success, and that's you. Now you have one last chance to retake an important decision. Don't waste your time on people who seem to be standing in your way. 
VIRGO, It seems that you may well have been sacrificing your resources defending something which is no longer viable, or at least which has no more to contribute to your personal success. You must now consider the advantages of making a fresh start. 
LIBRA, Happily, business and professional affairs dovetail nicely, and you'd be strongly advised to follow hunches and listen to your intuition. Ideas of romance are also in the air, adding a lighter touch to the day's events, and a secret flirtation is now a very real possibility. 
SCORPIO, In financial matters you must listen to partners carefully, as their ideas are proving more inspiring with each day that passes. Yet don't allow yourself to be led astray by those who are intent on exploiting your good nature or foisting their responsibilities onto your shoulders. 
SAGITTARIUS, Under Mars' alignment with a money-minded sector of your horoscope, financial enterprises are still likely to be the subject of some stiff negotiations. You'll be surprisingly business-like, and your new-found strength of confidence may catch partners off guard. 
CAPRICORN, Important personal decisions are looming and tricky decisions will have to be taken quite soon. You are now in the closing phase of a long-term emotional transformation, one which has seen you link up with important new people. Plus, you're about to receive the recognition you deserve at work. 
AQUARIUS, Today's events may come close to calling your broader ambitions and long-term objectives into question. The results will be positive if you manage to focus on what is important, make a clean break with the past - and set off on a new course of action. 
TAURUS, Please be mindful of your domestic responsibilities today, otherwise partners will have every right to pull you up sharply. The position of the Moon suggests that this is a time which is advantageous though testing. Can you live up to the challenge? 
GEMINI, Travel plans should proceed, but keep a sense of proportion and do be prepared to make alternative arrangements. You can achieve more than you had hoped if you make the effort to adapt to changing circumstances. The Moon's support gives you the edge in a trial of wills at home, thankfully. CANCER The emphasis is on social activities and you'll be under pressure to fulfil commitments which you may have undertaken in haste. You really must pay attention to the need for agreements. Unnecessary friction will rebound on you, possibly undermining your own interests. 
LEO, You may have too much money or, more likely, too little, but the amount is not the problem. Your main concern is not cash, but how you are going to use your resources. What is bothering you is the choice between different options, for example, whether to save or spend. You may defer decisions until later in the week. 
VIRGO, Always act in accordance with what you know to be right. Now, you may hear an item of news which spurs you on to decisive action, but don't take any notice of idle gossip. Intriguing possibilities will open up if you adopt a determined and controversial course. 
LIBRA, Sept. 24 - Oct. 23) There seems to be a distance between you and loved ones, perhaps a physical gulf to be bridged. Don't worry - events are moving your way and a new involvement should be adding sparkle to your daily life. In the final analysis, you will do your best in a financial venture. 
SCORPIO, In the past, partnership problems may have undermined your self-esteem and sapped your morale. What is needed now is resolute action together with the confidence that with or without other people, and relying only on yourself, life will go from strength to strength. 
SAGITTARIUS, Jupiter's flexible motion is obliging you to honour all past commitments and obligations. This is a profoundly fortunate period and is therefore no time to wallow in self-pity or to wonder what might have been if only you had followed a different path. 
CAPRICORN, At work, as in private affairs, so much depends on how you state your case. There seems little doubt that colleagues will be more than happy to adopt your ideas if you put them across in an acceptable manner. Your long-term needs must be taken into account. 
AQUARIUS, Mercury's influence over the nadir of your solar chart is obliging you to reconsider certain aspects of your life which you had until now regarded as fundamental to your existence. Perhaps nothing is as permanent as you imagined and, once you've learned this simple lesson, you'll have cracked one of life's major secrets. 
TAURUS, You must now move fast to exploit your advantages. This is a time for new beginnings, which means, of course, that you must be prepared to let go of the past and break the habits of a lifetime. This may not be easy, but then there is always a price to be paid for success. 
GEMINI, Beneficial planetary influences continue. You should be at your most spontaneous and creative at the present time, and there are plenty of opportunities for you to shape circumstances to your liking. You may share your secrets with a friend if you think this will help. CANCER Versatile conditions give you the chance to branch out into new avenues. Friends are likely to offer help quite soon, and when they do, you should accept it gracefully. It will do your morale good to realise you're no longer alone. Your deeper questions may not be answered for another three or four days, so be patient. 
LEO, Now that the Moon is so powerful we are unable to forecast that leisurely conditions will prevail. However, that's mainly because you're hovering on the edge of one of your intense moods. Mind you, friendly meetings are likely and work is liable to be more relaxed than usual. There might also be an unexpected opportunity to make your mark professionally. 
VIRGO, Although not everything is going your way, life does take on a more colourful quality and, if you wish, you may fall in with dramatic events. Otherwise you will have to concentrate on getting work done in preparation for meetings later in the week. 
LIBRA, Partners' expectations could be high, so look forward to a busy day, with unexpected developments to keep you occupied. Conserve your energy early on, as the build-up of pressure could be quite stressful. Plus, keep a watchful eye on financial developments. 
SCORPIO, Awkward planetary aspects today suggest an uncertain patch in relationships. Counter the celestial energies by making a mighty effort to see other people's points of view and reach agreement where possible. You will feel much more certain of yourself in three days' time. 
SAGITTARIUS, You are now aware that curious activities behind the scenes mean that you must remain alert. Early morning brings the chance of a misunderstanding between friends. Has someone broken a promise? A partner poses difficult questions, but you'll have a ready answer. 
CAPRICORN, Social complications are likely, perhaps due to financial difficulties. Problems which may seem insuperable this morning will sort themselves out by this evening - with a little help from the right quarter. Keep an eye on travel plans, otherwise you'll forget essential details in the midst of your excitement. 
AQUARIUS, Career-wise, you may strike a stressful note, yet inevitably your professional cares are intimately connected to domestic woes. Get to grips with the underlying issues and stop feeling sorry for yourself. There is more going for you at home than you imagine, so give relations and partners their due. 
TAURUS, Don't allow trivial responsibilities or irritating people to distract you from your noble goals. Now is the time of year to focus on your long-term aims and ambitions, planning ahead for the next twelve months. Venus' imminent change of position is set to boost your emotional life and social prospects — at last. 
GEMINI, It's always pleasant to have Venus, which rules your emotions, making its gentle way through a supportive region of your chart. The fact is that with such protection, anything which goes wrong will be the result of your own incompetence. At home, remember the golden rule - talk to partners before it's too late. Read | Farmers toolkit case: Aarey to EIA, Goa to Dehra Dun, Disha Ravi part of many climate causes CANCER You don't have to pay attention to rumours and suspicions that other individuals are not pulling their weight. They're probably falling prey to confusing messages put out by partners who should know better! Stick to your guns and few people will ever beat you to the winning post. 
LEO, Even though time is on your side, there is no room for complacency, and you must take colleagues' opinions into account. Career planning is absolutely necessary if you are to make the most of current opportunities and surmount recent obstacles. 
VIRGO, This is often a stimulating phase of the year for you - and now is no exception. Lift your sights from the routine trivia of day-to-day affairs and make definite moves to accomplish a number of life-long ambitions. A romantic mystery is about to be solved, much to your relief.

LIBRA, This is a quiet day of the week astrologically speaking. That doesn't mean you won't have a lot on but, if the planets adopt a hands-off attitude, you should be allowed to go your own way at your own pace. Spare a little extra thought for joint finances, but take no final decisions. 
SCORPIO, Now that Mercury has once again taken up a striking relationship with your sign, it will become increasingly clear that partners' ideas may be the best. It might be necessary for you to perform that most difficult of all tasks — compromise. Yet partners seem unwilling to give any ground themselves.

SAGITTARIUS, You may pay a little more attention to what partners want from you over the coming weeks. Someone is expecting you to take the lead if discussions are necessary on much-needed improvements. It's a fine time to make applications, attend interviews and generally familiarise yourself with the facts. 
CAPRICORN, You may now glimpse a life of possible creative flair and intellectual exploration. You'll be excited by fresh opportunities and new perspectives on old problems, so leave no stone unturned in your quest for inspiration. Pay extra attention to children: they deserve no less. 
AQUARIUS, You are about to be plunged briefly into a situation which you thought had been finished for good. The time is coming when you must think deeply about the conditions which have developed at home and which may have soured some of your family relationships. Try to see other people's points of view. 
TAURUS, Let others fret and fume over things which don't turn out right, like finances. You have too much going on to be distracted by people who are overly pessimistic. Travel stars are bright and I'd like to advise you to plan a faraway trip. 
GEMINI, It may seem the right time to get tough with someone who is acting unreasonably, especially if money is a bone of contention. If you know what's good for you, you'll do the following: develop overseas contacts, check up on legal angles and act only out of the highest of motives. CANCER In many ways you are now at a crossroads. It is always wise to seek advice when in doubt, and often wiser to consult as many people as possible. The number of options open to you may have diminished in purely numerical terms, but this has not prevented the waters from being muddied still further. 
LEO, You seem to have been brooding over problems surrounding your work, perhaps cash, but more likely your status and responsibilities. It all seems rather muddled, but there is scope for you to do a great deal of good, helping those worse off than you. 
VIRGO, The wheels of change are turning faster now. Just remember that, if any major financial decisions have to be taken, you may now safely take a gamble - as long as you correctly calculate the odds. The balance of probabilities is shifting in your favour, although obviously only you are familiar with the details. 
LIBRA, Everyone seems to want something from you, no doubt because your charms have attracted a wide audience. The most demanding people of all will be at home, but don't let that stop you enjoying yourself. Believe it or not, there are ways in which you can make the dullest of activities quite delightfully entertaining. 
SCORPIO, The planets are hitting the heights, and also entering the odd trough. There may be moments of high drama, and by accident or design you may end up feeling as if you've been let down. If you know what's good for you, you'll mix with people who have plenty of bright ideas and avoid those who seem intent on confrontation. 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus, the bringer of abundant affection, is on your side. It is important that you let children and lovers know exactly where you stand. With both the Moon and Jupiter lining up in your support, you can afford to be confident and can even risk losing somebody's goodwill. 
CAPRICORN, Mysterious, nebulous Neptune is a very important planet at the moment and you will not be able to put a certain dream or ideal out of your mind. What is very reassuring, though, is your new-found ability to think and reason clearly. Impress everyone with your creative flare and you will boost your reputation. 
AQUARIUS, Your imagination could run away with you. You are not exactly down-to-earth at the best of times, but right now logic will completely desert you. Some would say that this is no bad thing, and it looks as if you'll have a chance to press ahead on the basis of hunches and intuition. 
TAURUS, The fact that the perfect passionate alignment occurs tomorrow doesn't detract from today's splendid emotional prospects. Joy, happiness, nostalgia and sentiment vie with each other. Don't be too sensitive, though. By hoping for the best, you will actually help the best to happen. 
GEMINI, It's a day of work for most of you. If regular employment is not on the agenda, go for a traditional day of practical and household chores. Also, take one or two sensible measures to boost your physical well-being. The point is that you want to do something worthwhile, and not feel as if you've wasted your time. CANCER I'd like to remind you that you're now moving through a deeply prosperous phase, even though there are bound to be weekly and monthly fluctuations. That said, today's stars are wonderful for all partnership affairs and friendly meetings - as I hope you'll find. 
LEO, The Moon swoops over your horoscope, reminding you of the importance of harmonious and meaningful family connections, but don't demand commitment from those who are not prepared to give it. The best influences are saved for domestic spending and investments. 
VIRGO, You are under the poetic sway of Mercury and Venus, that most charming of celestial combinations. If you want to convince anyone of your finer qualities and persuade them that you are in the right, now is the time. Family members should be especially susceptible to your charms. 
LIBRA, Everything looks terribly favourable. Social and emotional developments augur well for the future and may be more significant than they seem at first sight. Shopping sprees are just the thing to lighten your mood. You'll also be shuffling your opinions, causing a spot of confusion along the way. 
SCORPIO, If you please one person who is important to you now, you are almost certain to offend another. If I were you, I'd avoid all controversial acts and potentially ambiguous statements for the next few weeks, and stick to tried and tested methods of getting your way. 
SAGITTARIUS, Before very much longer has passed you may have had one or two little intuitions on the way your life is going and what you should do to improve things as you go along. Nurture your spirit and allow time for quiet, meditative thought, healing your inner hurts. 
CAPRICORN, One special relationship is undergoing a process that is bound to strengthen it in the long run. Even casual acquaintances may have more than you expect to offer in the emotional department. Combine maturity and stability with a child-like delight in the romantic potential that's soon to come your way. 
AQUARIUS, Many of you may be working hard this weekend. Those of you at home may be concerned about your, or a partner's, professional prospects. Financial potential is exceptionally bright and social trends are good - as long as you let partners take first place from time to time! 
TAURUS, Lunar alignments focus on work early on, but then begin to shift towards personal and social matters. If, by any chance, you can fix up a delayed engagement today, that would be as well. It looks very much as if you will be able to get the better of a rival, by the way. 
GEMINI, You may be a little tired and tense, but that is no surprise. Your energy should already be reviving, and within about five or six days you should feel a whole lot better. There's only a few more days to wait for a promised invitation, so please be patient! CANCER Everything should now have come to the boil, both at home and at work. With any luck you will now be able to see your way forward much more clearly - and you will soon be in a position to deal wonderfully with all those little irritating, niggling developments. 
LEO, Don't fret over what looks like a setback. After all, liabilities have a pleasant way of turning out to be assets. If a loved one seems to have no time for you, be patient and wait for them to get over the current, tricky phase; if they need anything, they need your understanding. 
VIRGO, Hidden tensions rise to the surface and may pop up in the most unlikely settings. As so often happens, money may be the catalyst for a frank exchange of views, but I doubt if you'll fully understand how you got where you are. If you really can't work out what a partner is up to, perhaps you should leave them to it! 
LIBRA, Although there are many awkward factors to deal with, something in the sky is indicating that the answer lies within, rather than without. In other words, a change of attitude or opinion may do the trick. But, in the long run, you also have to put your plans into effect - nobody else will. 
SCORPIO, I know you have misgivings about the long-term future, but you should be able to appreciate certain short-term benefits. The Moon will enter a new position very soon, endowing you with greater emotional strength, indicating a renewed determination to succeed. 
SAGITTARIUS, What's most important now seems to be the link between you and a whole range of other people. From out of your current social network will emerge the saviours of the future, so be nice to people in the knowledge you'll have need of them soon - very soon indeed! 
CAPRICORN, As life is starting to go right in one area, you may be let down in another. This is a result of the mysterious magic wrought by that magnificent trio of cosmic giants, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. That's a combination which really gets your imagination going! 
AQUARIUS, It will be difficult to convince you that some kind of a temporary break or separation is for the best. Yet you must eventually see that if one connection comes to an end, another will arise. Partners have the edge today, so you may have to graciously take second place. 
TAURUS, If you're a little edgy it's because you're highly intuitive - and that you sense fresh possibilities are fanning out. If you don't make a choice now, events over the next seven days may force the pace. But, if you do take a decision, you can always change your mind, later. 
GEMINI, Today's lunar alignments enhance much that is best in your character. Someone at home may have left you feeling slightly perplexed and scratching your head. On the other hand, you still have plenty of time to complete domestic arrangements to suit your aims and interests. CANCER Slowly, and with great subtlety, an old order of life has passed away. And as one set of conditions and feelings fade, the space is made for another. Yet, for many of you, there is still much to be done. The only problem is that it's almost impossible to predict when the current cycle will be completed. 
LEO, Everything in your chart focuses on the personal rather than the professional. By this I don't mean that you're obsessed by family issues, but that everything you do should be motivated by your inner needs and desires. Follow your nose and you may get where you want to be much more quickly than if you follow partners. 
VIRGO, Someone may ruffle your feathers, but I have a feeling that if anyone causes an upset today, it may be you. This may be no bad thing, for you are probably quite justified in insisting that other people see things your way. But that won't stop you putting your foot in it! 
LIBRA, It's not like you to criticise other people unfairly but, if you're stuck in a corner, that's exactly what you may do. This would be a shame, for you have a reputation to keep up. So don't let anyone tempt you into gossiping about a mutual friend - unless you have only good things to say about them. 
SCORPIO, Mercury and Venus are both positively placed, each in its own way, so friends and team-mates should still be crowding round with words of encouragement. You may therefore feel that you are strong enough to embark on a brand new adventure. You deserve a break! 
SAGITTARIUS, Within the next day or so you may begin to realise that someone was not really what they seemed. Any sense of disappointment may be matched by a realisation that the time has come to get out and make new friends. If your judgement was poor in the past, then at least you have learnt a valuable lesson. 
CAPRICORN, Difficult as a current situation may be, you have little option but to sit it out. When all is said and done, you must see that your current circumstances, financial, professional and personal, are largely as you have shaped them. It's time to take responsibility! 
AQUARIUS, It is difficult to get away from the fact that money and material security are dominating your thoughts and plans, even at an unconscious level. A friend, possibly a female friend, may offer the help you need. It may require, though, that you change a long-standing approach. 
TAURUS, Today may be mildly confusing and irritating. My advice would be to fit in with the lunar cycle by going all out for rest, relaxation, self-indulgence and personal pleasure. Stand up to pressures to conform, for people who want you to fit in don't always have your best interests at heart. 
GEMINI, In many ways the most hectic part of the week is only now beginning, but it's possible that a promised offer or invitation may vanish before your eyes, like a mirage in the desert. You'll have to move fast to achieve your deepest desires. CANCER Just a word about Mars, that aggressive planet which is beavering away in a busy region of your horoscope, and is causing one or two problems at work; don't get involved in unnecessary arguments. And don't believe any gossip, especially if it concerns somebody close. 
LEO, You may soon have to take urgent action, but just how urgent is another matter. In spite of certain personal questions, you may be under considerably less pressure to act than other people. And this means that you can time your own affairs until you sense you have the maximum advantage. 
VIRGO, Your current Sun-Moon angle brings a turning point in a number of important personal cycles. There's just one problem though, and it's that as far as some people are concerned you may be past your sell-by date. Show these arrogant types just how wrong they are! 
LIBRA, The Moon's movements over the next two or three days offer a preview of what will happen over the next two or three months. In a sense you may treat the next forty-eight hours as a sort of new beginning and a chance for a fresh start. It's an opportunity to be welcomed. 
SCORPIO, The tension is mounting, but the strange fact is that developments which at first seem to be rather a drag may turn out to be exactly what you want. Hopefully, friends won't mind that you are now about to enter a much more secretive, but optimistic, phase. 
SAGITTARIUS, Celestial pressures like those you're under at the moment don't occur every day. They do, however, happen about once a month, so you should recognise that today's fluctuations in your energy are part of a regular cycle. What's important is your ability to make the most of a personal opportunity. 
CAPRICORN, The fact that today's celestial influences are auspicious is encouraging. But you're not necessarily off the hook just yet. Even a moment's complacency may give someone else the chance to let you down, over-charge or mislead you! Keep a close watch on all such dubious situations. 
AQUARIUS, Partners willingness to co-operate and discuss certain long-term plans may make you somewhat uncomfortable. However, you should now be able to put your point of view with considerably more success. And that has to make you feel a great deal more confident. 
TAURUS, Work will probably bring you a great deal of satisfaction. The whole point about the current period is the deep desire for greater fulfilment and a more intense sense of personal meaning. You'll have to listen carefully to partners - probably because they're right! 
GEMINI, There is still so much emphasis on business involvements that you may be all hyped-up. At the very heart of the matter lies an urge for material security that may actually smother lesser motivations. In other words, you might get financial needs tangled-up with emotional desires. CANCER Refuse to be drawn over family matters, because whatever you say or do now, circumstances will soon change. In fact, within a month you may have completely altered some of your deeply-held ideas. And, as your opinions change, so will your behaviour - and so will your future. 
LEO, You should be able to make other people smile, bringing a dose of your legendary good humour into the day's proceedings. We will all be better off if you take an optimistic course and turn away from petty problems. After all, you really do have so much to give to the world. 
VIRGO, This is one of those days when you could be waiting for something to happen. Don't expect plans to work out as expected. If they do, all well and good; if they don't, do appreciate the chance for a change. And try and make some time for social relaxation. 
LIBRA, Although the heavens are being remarkably good to you, I have no doubt that you feel rather undermined. Your biggest problem is probably not what other people say, but your own tendency to be too self-critical. Go easy on yourself and you'll be better placed to make the most of welcome invitations. 
SCORPIO, Expect the unexpected today, and welcome it when it comes. The next Sun-Moon angle will urge you to embrace all that is new and untried. If serious matters are to be dealt with, then you should bring friends into the picture - there's someone close who already knows what you need to know! 
SAGITTARIUS, Can you afford to make an error of judgment now? I don't think you can. The margin of safety is so slight that you must play it safe. In love, you may be too concerned with partners' potential status and prestige. But what seems so desirable today may seem very different tomorrow. 
CAPRICORN, This is no time to be devious. Not only are you likely to gain most from being open and straightforward, you are also due to benefit from someone else's honesty. It's truth time for Capricorn! You're being presented with an amazing opportunity to look right into your deepest feelings and motives. 
AQUARIUS, You, more than most people, deserve a chance to take your mind off recent struggles. One word of advice is to be aware of the legal or ethical issues that may have a bearing on your future plans. Everything is up for grabs, but a cautious approach could get you everything you need. 
TAURUS, Don't sit still today. The approaching lunar phase cycle is ideal for all adventurous, creative and expansive Taureans. Please don't pass up a golden opportunity by being a stick-in-the-mud. And, besides, if you miss out on this week's offers, you'll kick yourself. 
GEMINI, The tensions may be building up at home, but a threatened argument may not materialise, a little like a thunder storm which builds up and then fails to break. Deft footwork will aid your cause, and they'll even be times when you're able to disappear into the background. CANCER Concentrate on letting other people know what you think and how you feel. The entire emphasis of the moment is on communication, so many of you may be called away on a short journey. In that case, my sincere advice is to check, double-check and treble-check all essential details. 
LEO, Two important celestial factors, one Mars and the other Saturn, are responsible for making this a generally auspicious day. One word for the whole week, though, is to keep a close eye on financial comings and goings. Above all, be as utterly practical as you can. 
VIRGO, You're in for a bit of a bumpy ride but Mercury, the planet which rules your mental processes, should now soften the blow or compensate for any disappointment caused by recent delays. You may, briefly, have to go over old ground, but the results of such persistence will be splendid. 
LIBRA, Look very closely at an issue which may cause a little pain. You have nothing to fear because, over the next seven days, the planets are assuming a pattern which simultaneously favours both your inner, private world and your successful public demeanour. 
SCORPIO, It's time to put your own ideas forward, regardless of what society says. Don't stand on ceremony, but do make your personal status the overriding factor. Professional and community-minded Scorpios will do best; those of you stuck at home may watch the world drifting by. 
SAGITTARIUS, Seen from one angle, the situation at work this week could not be more auspicious, yet there is a chance that you could let a marvellous opportunity slip from your grasp. Move, without delay, to a position where nobody can challenge you - and everyone supports you. 
CAPRICORN, There's no denying that it will take a great deal of effort to reach your goals, but then that's part of what being a Capricorn is all about. Yet if you stick to your principles, it will be so much easier. For one thing, you'll earn family members' respect. 
AQUARIUS, It may be necessary to take swift action to rectify a blunder, possibly one with financial overtones, yet by the end of the week you will see that principles are so much more important than profit. Your major priority is to build up your support network, seeing to it that friends are on your side. 
TAURUS, Let others fret and fume over things which don't turn out right, like finances. You have too much going on to be distracted by people who are overly pessimistic. Travel stars are bright and I'd like to advise you to plan a faraway trip. 
GEMINI, It may seem the right time to get tough with someone who is acting unreasonably, especially if money is a bone of contention. If you know what's good for you, you'll do the following: develop overseas contacts, check up on legal angles and act only out of the highest of motives. CANCER In many ways you are now at a crossroads. It is always wise to seek advice when in doubt, and often wiser to consult as many people as possible. The number of options open to you may have diminished in purely numerical terms, but this has not prevented the waters from being muddied still further. 
LEO, You seem to have been brooding over problems surrounding your work, perhaps cash, but more likely your status and responsibilities. It all seems rather muddled, but there is scope for you to do a great deal of good, helping those worse off than you. 
VIRGO, The wheels of change are turning faster now. Just remember that, if any major financial decisions have to be taken, you may now safely take a gamble - as long as you correctly calculate the odds. The balance of probabilities is shifting in your favour, although obviously only you are familiar with the details. 
LIBRA, Everyone seems to want something from you, no doubt because your charms have attracted a wide audience. The most demanding people of all will be at home, but don't let that stop you enjoying yourself. Believe it or not, there are ways in which you can make the dullest of activities quite delightfully entertaining. 
SCORPIO, The planets are hitting the heights, and also entering the odd trough. There may be moments of high drama, and by accident or design you may end up feeling as if you've been let down. If you know what's good for you, you'll mix with people who have plenty of bright ideas and avoid those who seem intent on confrontation. 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus, the bringer of abundant affection, is on your side. It is important that you let children and lovers know exactly where you stand. With both the Moon and Jupiter lining up in your support, you can afford to be confident and can even risk losing somebody's goodwill. 
CAPRICORN, Mysterious, nebulous Neptune is a very important planet at the moment and you will not be able to put a certain dream or ideal out of your mind. What is very reassuring, though, is your new-found ability to think and reason clearly. Impress everyone with your creative flare and you will boost your reputation. 
AQUARIUS, Your imagination could run away with you. You are not exactly down-to-earth at the best of times, but right now logic will completely desert you. Some would say that this is no bad thing, and it looks as if you'll have a chance to press ahead on the basis of hunches and intuition. 
TAURUS, You might be too pre-occupied by professional or other ambitious matters to take any time off just now. If leisure activities are on the agenda, the priorities should be those which are practical and designed to enhance your status and standing in the community. 
GEMINI, Give more attention to social gatherings, even if you had other plans. Also, take great care with all legal matters and anything affecting your normally high standards. Overseas trips and contacts could have more to do with business or serious pressures than with pleasure. CANCER Certain planets make their exit from helpful sectors of your chart just as others enter, so it's very much a matter of swings and roundabouts. One of the best things you can do today is stop being just a face in the crowd, and draw attention to yourself for a change. 
LEO, You're basking under one of those rare planetary alignments that could bring good fortune. It will help if you follow others' suggestions and remain open to ideas you'd normally ignore. Plus, don't provoke a partner unnecessarily, or they might give as good as they get! 
VIRGO, You may have made too much of someone in the past, so much so that now they have come to expect what you can no longer deliver. The curious thing about today's problems is that they can probably be solved by throwing money at them. Of course, you have to pick the right target! 
LIBRA, Not only do other people think they're right, they'll probably miss no opportunity to tell you so! Adopt a policy of amused tolerance in the face of partners, friends and colleagues who are all determined to go their own sweet way. You might try trusting someone for a change, as well! 
SCORPIO, The Moon, invariably your most important planet, urges you to stay busy and try to make yourself useful. At home, you may make practical measures the number one priority, and take special precautions against breakages. A little extra care now will do you a power of good in the long run. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may put psychological conflicts to one side and go all out to achieve a major, but very personal, ambition. Realise that there is no conflict between your personal happiness and the greater good, and that you can help others while helping yourself. 
CAPRICORN, When the Sun is as constructively aligned as it is today, you'd be a fool to keep plans and intentions to yourself any longer. Others are anxious to hear what you have to say and, as it happens, you've rarely been better placed to say it! All you have to do is choose the right words. 
AQUARIUS, Secret spending and charitable giving are two of the strongest themes in your solar chart at the moment. The alternative is that you'll be a gift to con-men who will see you coming at five hundred paces! If someone makes a fantastic promise, check out the details before it's too late. 
TAURUS, Jupiter, planet of optimism, urges you to adopt a creative solution to all current questions. However, for at least the next four weeks, you might do best to keep certain sensitive thoughts to yourself. You'll probably have to make some very finely-balanced judgements. 
GEMINI, Now you can begin to involve other people in your plans, but do take it easy. The last thing you should do is insist that everyone does as you say, so it's much better to listen carefully, and then incorporate all good advice into your schemes. CANCER All ambitious individuals should have a field-day. If you're at work, have one last stab at a professional coup, but don't worry if you don't achieve your aims this time around. There'll be other chances later. Perhaps you can take this opportunity to smarten up your act. 
LEO, Think about partners before you think about yourself, for this is a fine time to let others take the initiative. You should realise that it may in fact be good for you to do what you're told! In other words, you should probably focus on your responsibilities, not your rights. 
VIRGO, The entire situation is still looking slightly uncertain, but that doesn't mean that you're going to lose out. Far from it. You should know by now that if you trust one special partner, they'll come up with the goods in the end. You might have a long wait, though. 
LIBRA, Mercury moves erratically through your chart, which means that if partners don't say things just once, they certainly won't say them more than twice. You'd better be on the ball if you want to keep up! After all, you might not get a second chance, even if you ask for one. 
SCORPIO, Extra hard work ahead seems to be the main planetary message. Even if you're determined to take time off, the best pursuits should be those which keep you most active. After all, idle hands seek out mischief, as the old saying goes. Work off all that excess energy! 
SAGITTARIUS, The number of planets occupying the base of your solar chart makes it clear that, in the last resort, you can only do what you want. However, an inner instinct might suggest that there is something wrong with being 'selfish', and the result could be a missed opportunity. 
CAPRICORN, There is still a great deal to be said for coming clean at home and making a complete break with the past. However, all that is required right now is a change of attitude, so you can probably prevaricate over practical changes for another few weeks at least. 
AQUARIUS, Mars' business-like relationship with Saturn creates one of those difficult relationships that favours all good, hard-working individuals and punishes all those who are lazy and incompetent. It's as if the great celestial schoolmaster is waving his stick at you! 
TAURUS, The emphasis still seems to be on group affairs rather than on individual concerns. You may therefore still need to put others' interests first, even if that does go against the grain. Keep your eye on the fact that you will eventually prosper from your good deeds. 
GEMINI, This is a fine week to organise travel plans, and even if you're not getting down to detailed arrangements, you should at least check out all the general options. As a matter of interest, this is also an excellent moment for long-distance romance, if you can manage it. CANCER The Sun is calling your attention to broader interests, perhaps bringing in an overseas connection. Certainly it would do your morale no end of good to incorporate an overseas dimension into current affairs. You might also be fascinated by individuals from cultures which are very different from yours. 
LEO, That emotional pair of planets, Venus and Mars, are still challenging you in various ways, which means that partners have the advantage, no matter what shape and size they come in. To be perfectly honest, you must admit that a close friend was correct all along. 
VIRGO, You're often right, that's for sure. But once in a while you must accept that even you can be wrong. However, the truth, as you may now find out, is relative, and while you may have got the facts back to front, you may also have learned a lot in the process. 
LIBRA, You'd do well to get on with basic tasks, and even if you're all out for pleasure and self-indulgence, you'll have to organise your time. The best leisure pursuits seem to be those which offer self-improvement and, if you feel that you're doing something worthwhile, then you'll be much happier. 
SCORPIO, Maintain good lines of communication. You have to talk to people who need to know, and if at first they don't listen you'll just have to repeat yourself. The wonderful thing is that you don't have to act on what you say. In fact, you might be able to slow down at work. 
SAGITTARIUS, Pluto sails through your chart at a snail's pace. Yet sometimes, as now, the emotional intensity it rules wells up from the depths of your soul. That's precisely why this is such an important time to look on the bright side and always see the best in people. 
CAPRICORN, The overwhelming weight of planetary influences is still bent on extravagance and increases of spending in every area. However, there's one big condition, you should consult other people first. Actually, you'll do much better if you take their ideas seriously. 
AQUARIUS, Not everything is as it seems. What appears to you to be a trifle, may be extremely important to a close partner. It's therefore more than necessary for you to genuinely try to understand what they're really saying. You may go that extra mile to achieve a good compromise. 
TAURUS, It's time for a fresh start socially, and certain friendships may require a new lease of life. There's no need for dramatic action, but the odd phone call or kind word will certainly help you along. You may, if you wish, spend some time pursuing a few pleasurable distractions, whatever others say. 
GEMINI, The issues at work, as well as at home, seem to have a lot to do with authority. The stars are not being specific, but prefer to pose questions such as whether you are capable of handling current responsibilities. See to it that the answer is a definite ‘yes'. CANCER You should give a little extra space to the religious dimension. It's not a question of dogma, but of following general ethical principles and checking that what you, and other people, are doing, is for the best. If you attempt to push yourself to the front now, you may be forced to take a back seat later, when you least expect it. 
LEO, The gentle movement of planets through your solar chart has been nudging you towards a revision of joint financial arrangements. Today's planetary energies indicate that you've reached a welcome point, and that you can stop and check out the best step to take next. 
VIRGO, Today's lunar alignments could be something of an anti-climax, even if they are still special. The truth is hard to gauge probably for reasons which are completely topsy-turvy. The point is that you shouldn't expect to make sense of everything, or even of anything. 
LIBRA, You may devote more attention to improving working conditions, including domestic chores. It's not a matter of new gadgets or processes, but of changing your deep-seated attitudes, some of which have been too resistant. You'll know when the time for compromise draws near. 
SCORPIO, A little additional creative flare is required today. One factor in your chart indicates that responsibilities for children will supersede all others, another that you should make a point of being more child-like, innocent and naive in your actions. 
SAGITTARIUS, If there's a possibility of changes for the better at home, move quickly, for the window of opportunity will soon be closed again. In this sense your greatest failing of the day could be complacency. If you take your eyes off important matters for a moment, they might follow a course that you don't like. 
CAPRICORN, The best thing you can do today is question your assumptions, change your attitudes and improve your outlook. Otherwise, you are likely to perpetuate an astrological pattern which has left you worse off financially in the past. Do the right thing now and you'll turn a likely loss into a potential profit. 
AQUARIUS, You would do well to promote your business skills at the moment. You do seem to be in with a chance of changing your monetary direction for the better, and all you need to do is convince others that your vision of the future is the right one. 
TAURUS, You will probably have a long way to go before you finally achieve a cherished goal, but that doesn't mean that you can't have instant success at least in little ways. The best means of impressing employers is to display a vast enthusiasm for the job! 
GEMINI, Your regular cycles are partly dictated by Mercury, which represents your best and brightest ideas and which, just now, happens to be in a particularly sensitive state. Everyone should know that you must be allowed to day-dream to your heart's content. CANCER Do yourself a favour and get to grips with business affairs before it's too late. Even your emotional contentment revolves around joint financial arrangements, and a material tie could restrain your romantic happiness. That would do nobody any good, least of all you. 
LEO, Today's lunar challenge to your sign suggests that partners may stand in opposition to your plans. You'll do best if you realise that criticism is not intended to wound, but does contain a germ of truth. Don't over-react, and do listen carefully. 
VIRGO, The general picture favours work and extra energy in all matters. The message is therefore to stick to the straight and narrow. As far as personal relationships are concerned, realise that good feeling can only be maintained if you put in sufficient effort. 
LIBRA, Please don't imagine that work and play are complete opposites. In fact, they're different sides of the same coin, and current indications are that work should be enjoyable and that leisure activities should require extra personal effort. That way lies a balanced and contented life! 
SCORPIO, So much has happened in the home and family sphere that other people may be slightly confused or perplexed. You should therefore make allowances for the fact that their view of the world may be very different from yours. In other words, please don't jump to instant conclusions. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sometimes you just have to come clean. This is a very useful moment indeed to say exactly what you feel, especially if family members have been burying their heads in the sand. At work, it's naturally also a very good time for interviews and applications, so prepare your case with care. 
CAPRICORN, You need to dig deep to find the answer tall today's questions. The distant murmur of complaints about this and that may be beginning to irritate you, but try putting yourself in a partner's position so you can see exactly how they feel. And don't miss the point! 
AQUARIUS, The Moon is especially active today, enhancing your control over contemporary events. You may therefore put your foot down at home and bring family members - and anyone else you live with - into line. But will they take any notice? That's another question! 
TAURUS, Current communication difficulties will be eased by the relationship of Mercury to your sign, which is helping you to think clearly. Mars and Saturn, on the other hand, are sending you challenging patterns, indicating that you must take a more flexible attitude, abandoning some of the your expectations. 
GEMINI, Mercury, your ruling planet, is behaving itself for once. Mind you, you might have to resign yourself to the fact that partners could disagree with you, and may even decline to offer you the support that you believe you deserve. From your point of view, it's best to listen carefully. CANCER Although your personal prospects are still looking good, and you are busier than usual, see this as a period of caution; a time to push ahead with your own plans as conscientiously as possible and to respect the fact that colleagues have their own ideas which are every bit as valid as yours. 
LEO, You have a natural tendency to over-dramatise situations, never more so than when an emotional planet such as Venus is creating tension and raising the passionate temperature. Deal with personal problems correctly and the coming period will be a time to rejoice in the company of your family and friends. 
VIRGO, Judging from your solar chart, it seems unlikely that a major upheaval is on the way. Instead, you'll be presented with a series of opportunities to breathe fresh air into situations which you have sometimes found restrictive. Partners must allow you to find your own way and travel in a direction which suits you. 
LIBRA, The group of planets which will be aligned with your sign over the coming months is urging you to make fundamental reforms in your whole life. However, your experience, wisdom and maturity mean that, in the future, you will have much greater control over the final outcome of your actions. 
SCORPIO, This week is not exactly set to be a time of peace and quiet, at least not as far as the celestial spheres are concerned. You have everything going for you, yet somewhere along the line it looks as if you might make a blunder, perhaps betraying a confidence or revealing secret plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mars is still the critical factor, driving you forward with its relentless power. Yet possibly your major period is mid-week when your financial fantasies will collide with the real world. Hopefully, the result will be a profit! You may have to travel in search of social or romantic fulfilment. 
CAPRICORN, Solar patterns bring to mind the ancient proverb to the effect that, if you think you are confused, you shouldn't worry because the next person is probably much more muddled than you are. In fact, this is a period of supreme inspiration, so dream your dreams, and see where your imagination leads. 
AQUARIUS, You should follow your ruling planet's down-to-earth disposition by making more effort to implement your plans. Too often, you have had ideas which can only be described as brilliant, but have lacked the will or the ability to put them into practice. Now is the time to change for the better. 
TAURUS, At last the planets are giving you a bit of attention. In the first instance this means that a log-jam should shift at home, enabling you to make the most of family conditions and domestic developments. Second, you'll be able to continue with an intriguing romantic ambition. 
GEMINI, Ninety percent of your planetary patterns are still favourable, auspicious, enjoyable and thoroughly pleasant. That leaves ten percent making for an intense and serious-minded approach, which will grow ever more insistent as the hours pass. CANCER In amongst the domestic and responsible influences, lies a lunar pattern urging you to throw yourself into passion and pleasure with abandon. Can you loosen your inhibitions enough to truly enjoy yourself? Perhaps you can, but there could be a cost - emotional as well as financial. 
LEO, There is a strong chance that long-term family hopes and domestic plans could take a rapid leap forward. In fact, you may be surprised by the suddenness of various events. A social engagement, which was postponed some time ago, will soon be rescheduled. 
VIRGO, Money still lies at the centre of everything, so show a little understanding if someone close seems bent on spending in an extravagant fashion. It will do you good to talk about your feelings, especially now that the air seems to have been cleared. 
LIBRA, There's a great deal in favour of high standards but, also, on some occasions at least, much to be said for lowering your sights to a more realistic level. That way you'll be able to give others the benefit of the doubt and everyone will be much happier. 
SCORPIO, Loved ones have made you thoroughly miserable at times, but sorrow can be so sweet. There's something wonderfully sentimental in your character and, believe it or not, you can relish the downs as well as the ups! It's all part of life's rich tapestry! 
SAGITTARIUS, It doesn't matter whether something that surfaced recently was seen as a threat or a promise. The point is that, whatever it is, it's disappeared beneath the waves again, giving you a few more days to prepare your ground. You can afford to take a fairly relaxed view, just as long as everything you do is totally above board. 
CAPRICORN, Go for a sociable weekend, or do some overtime. In other words, stay active in the big, wide world. As far as family affairs are concerned, it seems to be the extended circle which is important rather than immediate relatives. And, in love, it is time to mend fences and build bridges. 
AQUARIUS, You are about to make a pleasing discovery, the importance of which may not be clear for some time. In fact, now that Mars is behaving itself, a new world will open up before you. Enjoy yourself! And give yourself all the time you need to catch up with everything that's happened in the last six months. 
TAURUS, It's difficult to think of a busier time but, when all the planets are occupying such distinctive positions in your horoscope, you must pace yourself properly. Stretch yourself by all means, but relax as well. And in matters of the heart, put your feelings first, social pressures second. 
GEMINI, Rewards for recent endeavours will come your way before long, possibly today. You should end the week feeling wealthier, wiser and more secure. If you're aware of the affection that others feel for you, you will also feel more loved. And that in turn will encourage success in other areas of your life. CANCER You're such a worrier, but never give way to negative thoughts. Don't allow events close to home to undermine you, but please do understand that it's getting to grips with intimate and family affairs that will set you up for the future. Bury your head in the sand no longer! 
LEO, Your mind seems to be cluttered up with so many thoughts, it's hard to know what to do next. The sages of old used to talk about the virtues of emptying the mind of all trivia, but then that's easier said than done! Whatever the case, do try to make some time for yourself. 
VIRGO, There is still plenty of tension around, but you can afford to take a deep breath and plan for a future free from certain imaginary worries and illusory fears. The next week could bring its share of mystery, so have your answers ready - and get a grip on the facts. 
LIBRA, An additional factor is introduced into your horoscope today - the need to pay for your plans. You're on the crest of a wave, but a strong nerve is necessary to carry you forward. Don't let petty distractions get you down. After all, you still have much to achieve that is so worthwhile. 
SCORPIO, You can think about what exactly you need to do next. You could use your time to bring family and domestic affairs into the open. The Moon indicates that you could be somewhat volatile, but that you are also entitled to insist only on the highest standards. 
SAGITTARIUS, Whoever you are, whatever you have been through, and no matter how much has been stirred up, you must understand that what happens to you is part of an unfolding pattern. Recent events have given you the chance to move a little closer towards your destiny. 
CAPRICORN, Being mistress, or master, of your own future, is more important to you than it once was. You should make an almighty effort to attain your major ambitions, both professional and otherwise. And, if you have a chance to put a loved one's mind at rest, please do so without delay. 
AQUARIUS, The next few days may be emotionally challenging, but you should not run away from difficulties. The truth is that other people will be offering you very good advice, together with a totally new way of looking at yourself. You can now concentrate on boosting your self-esteem. 
TAURUS,: We have to face the fact that you may not be affected by current circumstances in the same way as other people. It's possible, therefore, that you'll have to watch while partners take the limelight, but not for long. The advantage is that you could be left in peace to get on with your own schemes. 
GEMINI,: Someone is enchanting you. But, from their point of view, they may be more under your spell than you are under theirs. Whatever the truth of the matter, it seems certain that a meeting of minds is inevitable. And, out of that, could come a new, solid commitment. CANCER: You may be on tenterhooks. The obvious response to your concerns is 'relax, it might never happen'. You may find this unsympathetic but then, in more ways than one, you have been here before, haven't you? In fact, and here's a strange twist, what you're thinking about might already have happened - without your noticing! 
LEO,: It should be particularly easy to express yourself at the moment. Even for those who are not interested in what you have to say, your views will eventually prove to be deeply pertinent, prophetic even. In general, though, you can begin to wind down the pressure in a number of areas. 
VIRGO,: You are probably spending far too much, not to mention thinking about money more than is really necessary. After a momentary lapse, you may come to realise that your security relies more on emotional contentment than the quantity of coins in your pocket. 
LIBRA,: Today's planetary formation is like a sort of small birthday shared by everyone born under your sign all at the same time. After a period of contemplation, work out what your top priority is and make a personal wish. Implement whatever you decide without delay. 
SCORPIO,: Forget the real world - it's time for some heavy day-dreaming. If you have chores and responsibilities you really can't shelve, then make whatever time for yourself you can. In love, play it cool - but don't be too fussy. And don't pretend that feelings don't matter! 
SAGITTARIUS,: Your charms are definitely coming to the fore again, which will be very useful as far as your long-term interests are concerned. One thing I would say is that you must be prepared to lay out some cash up front if you are pursuing important schemes. 
CAPRICORN,: There is no reason for any unpleasantness, so don't allow yourself to be easily provoked. Authority needs to be respected and you, in your turn, must exercise power with dignity. There'll be moments when you have to stand back and let partners take first place - it's all in the timing. 
AQUARIUS,: Although you, and people around you, may be rather edgy, you need to be making stalwart resolutions about where you are going, and how. Travel influences are exceptionally strong, so take the opportunity to develop all overseas and long-distance contacts. 
TAURUS, I doubt if you'll have much time left over after all the routine chores have been completed and cleared up. One particularly important piece of advice is to watch your health. The last thing you want to do now is wear yourself out. If you're flat on your back, you'll be no use to anybody! 
GEMINI, You do not need reminding to keep on the straight and narrow. Enjoy yourself by all means, but remember that children and younger friends may be looking to you for support. A family gathering or party could be a good idea, just as long as you agree with partners on what's required. CANCER How far can you go? And will it be worth it when you get there? These are the sort of questions you should be asking yourself at the moment. If you can enlist partners' support it will all be so much more straightforward. But, then, isn't that always the case? 
LEO, Don't compare your troubles to other people's. I know that a lot of you have much to grumble about, but if you would open your eyes you'd see just how hard associates are trying to cheer you up. Actually, everything depends on whether you like hard work or not. If you do, you'll get on just fine! 
VIRGO, If you have a problem now, it may be related not so much to your own mistakes, as to a temporary hiccup in circumstances. Give yourself a break. If you think about it, there are now certain commitments which can look after themselves. And you can look after yourself! 
LIBRA, Hopefully, you are now aware of a general air of anticipation and excitement. If you can put daily cares to one side and tune in to the higher planetary energies, you'll realise that one phase of existence is coming to an end. And the good news is that another is beginning. 
SCORPIO, Don't close the shutters and bring down the blinds just yet. No sooner has the curtain been drawn on one cycle of existence, than a new one will begin. Listen to your conscience and the future will be bright. Plus, you may be interested to know that today is a grand moment for making final, financial choices. 
SAGITTARIUS, I know you've had a thousand and one practical details to preoccupy you, but if you can lift your eyes to the heavens, you'll focus on the broader picture. A whole host of trivial problems will fall into perspective at last. I know it's an effort but it will be worth it.   
CAPRICORN, You have been receiving confusing and conflicting signals but, within a few days, everything should be clear. Symbolically, today is a time to hibernate, so don't let anyone force your hand. After all, the moment you drop your guard, a rival or colleague could seize the initiative. 
AQUARIUS, It's ethical issues which raise their heads now. Question whether what you're doing is right and, if it's not, take the appropriate action. If you have a choice, go for the adventurous prospect. But make sure that you leave absolutely no loopholes whatsoever! 
TAURUS, There is still a measure of uncertainty, and confusing developments keep occurring, but there is a positive side to the unfolding drama. Hopefully you're now at the stage at which you can see increasing stability and security emerging from the fog. 
GEMINI, Some planets are urging you to move forward. Others are persuading you to stay still. Changes may seem as if they're coming out of the blue, but this is not how astrology works. In fact, everything that happens now relates to developments which took place a month or even a year ago. CANCER Your inner tension may be a little more than is healthy. Yet I imagine that, if you try to relax now, you may allow an opportunity to slip through your fingers. That is why you should keep your eye on the ball and check up on every single detail. 
LEO, You are not normally one to doubt your own confidence. Yet I'd like to see you questioning your own priorities, partly because there are fresh discoveries to be made. It's all a question of seeing the world anew, realising how much you have taken for granted. 
VIRGO, What you need now is enough money to get you out of a fix. Frankly, it seems to me that it's about time you enjoyed a spot of luxury, and if your earnings are to increase, it must be soon. Never forget though, that, if you set out to persuade someone that you're in the right, you will almost certainly be successful. 
LIBRA, It may not be time for congratulations just yet, but it soon will be. You'll have something to celebrate over the next few days. Turn your back on the past and resolve to make a completely fresh start. But - and this is a very big ‘but' - you must keep a very close watch on all practical developments. 
SCORPIO, Today may not be easy, but there's little you can't handle with your usual skill. You may react to even surprise developments with a sense of deja vu, as if you had known all along what would happen. Life at the moment can be so strange! That's partly because failure turns into success. 
SAGITTARIUS, Only a very negative frame of mind will prevent you from ending the week better off materially and spiritually than when it began. On the other hand, a little optimism will carry you to the stars. There could be a spot of social friction, but only if you fail to keep your commitments. 
CAPRICORN, A victory in one area of life has probably increased the likelihood of delay in another. It's an astrological law, you see, that the universe always returns to a state of balance. Yet right now you might be wondering just when that's going to happen! 
AQUARIUS, Someone special is reaching out to you now. They may come from a different world, one you don't know about, but this doesn't mean that the connection won't become valuable and permanent. Neither does it mean that you won't soon be able to benefit from the contact. 
TAURUS, Family pressures are certainly stirring things up, but just for now I imagine that significant developments are bubbling away below the surface. Get on and keep up to date with routine chores, otherwise you may lose control. Actually, there's no time like the present for taking on fresh responsibilities. 
GEMINI, A few quick quips at someone else's expense may be your idea of fun, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to exploit Mars' sharp and uncompromising power. A little generosity would suit you well. After all, you have nothing to fear. You'd do best to take a cool, practical approach, by the way. CANCER You've pushed your own interests in the past - and there's nothing wrong with that. Now you must go out in a very wholehearted way to impress family members and anyone else you live with. Formulate your plans today and be prepared to implement them within about forty-eight hours. 
LEO, A great deal of your legendary charm relies on the location of that graceful sign, Libra, in your solar chart. According to your current patterns and alignments, your sales pitch is about to reach an all-time peak. Now is the time to persuade reluctant partners. 
VIRGO, You are in a really good state to take a leap into the unknown. I know it's not in your nature to throw caution to the wind, but do try! You have no idea what will happen unless you open yourself to the new and untried. One word of advice, though: before you take a gamble, you have to work out the consequences! 
LIBRA, It's always difficult to leave the past behind but, for various reasons, you probably feel prepared to bid farewell to one close association. I suspect this is because somebody has given you such a rough ride, that you'll be happy to see the back of them! It's time to stick to your guns. 
SCORPIO, Hope springs eternal, and with so many planets presenting a mysterious face, that is precisely what you need. Or, perhaps, I should say that you could use a few good ideas. With the right moves you may also give hope to others, and there is no better way to use your current planetary energy. 
SAGITTARIUS, Socially you should be on a winning streak or, at least, you will be if you stop worrying about things like money and how much life is costing. The chances for a dreamy, soft-focus encounter really are splendid. But passions are also rising and colleagues could be argumentative. 
CAPRICORN, You are back to thinking that nobody loves you, but this is very far from the case. Let's look at the positive faces of your solar chart, starting with the fact that worldly ambitions are about to take a quantum leap forward. But first you have to complete a number of fundamental arrangements. 
AQUARIUS, Although your own intentions may be above reproach, don't criticise others whose standards seem to slip. Remember the old teaching about throwing stones. Never be the first to throw one unless you are absolutely blameless. In other words, don't criticise others when you are equally responsible. 
TAURUS, You must be sick and tired of astrologers accusing you of being a stick-in-the-mud. Well, now is your chance to prove them wrong by showing the whole world just how adventurous you can be. Now is not the time to turn down invitations, no matter how unlikely they may seem. 
GEMINI, Whatever is happening in your financial affairs has its roots in events that took place around six months ago. Very soon, perhaps within the next seven days, you will be presented with the opportunity to break a vicious cycle that has kept you poorer than you need be. CANCER It's full steam ahead for all you ambitious, thrusting Cancers. This is no moment to get all sensitive and upset or do your famous crab-like trick of walking sideways to avoid problems on the road ahead. You will richly deserve all the attention which is heading your way. 
LEO, I can only reiterate previous statements and forecasts to the effect that this is a selfless, charitable phase. You must therefore expect to put your own interests second if other people require your assistance. The only thing which is more important is your physical well-being. 
VIRGO, This week's stars smile on all Virgos with creative pursuits and artistic hobbies. Everyone born under this wonderful sign is heading for a series of fascinating social experiences. Everything is grist to your mill and you'll enjoy a wild outing one moment, a quiet night in, the next. 
LIBRA, Press ahead with all home improvements, particularly those involving the very fabric of your property - such as important repairs and decorating. Don't let anyone undermine you, especially as everything is set to go so very well. If plans are proceeding smoothly then don't interfere unless it's absolutely necessary. 
SCORPIO, You still need to keep a grip on the purse strings, although any financial partnership is likely to be profitable, especially if beautiful objects are on your shopping list. Your travel stars are now even stronger than last week, so get moving - or at least make plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, If your stars don't bring you a windfall, or some other remarkable stroke of financial luck now, they're just not doing their job. To an extent, good fortune may be balanced by losses, but the net result should be well worth it - and make you feel so much better. 
CAPRICORN, In some strange way, events in the world at large are going to reflect the pressures and tensions in your private affairs. There is no logical reason why this should be so - it's purely due to the strange nature of astrology. You may be working over the weekend. 
AQUARIUS, There may not appear to be any bright light at the end of the tunnel just yet but, if you look carefully, you will see that life is in an exciting phase which should work out in your favour. You may be a little overworked in the process! Look after yourself. 
TAURUS, You must be sick and tired of astrologers accusing you of being a stick-in-the-mud. Well, now is your chance to prove them wrong by showing the whole world just how adventurous you can be. Now is not the time to turn down invitations, no matter how unlikely they may seem. 
GEMINI, Whatever is happening in your financial affairs has its roots in events that took place around six months ago. Very soon, perhaps within the next seven days, you will be presented with the opportunity to break a vicious cycle that has kept you poorer than you need be. CANCER It's full steam ahead for all you ambitious, thrusting Cancers. This is no moment to get all sensitive and upset or do your famous crab-like trick of walking sideways to avoid problems on the road ahead. You will richly deserve all the attention which is heading your way. 
LEO, I can only reiterate previous statements and forecasts to the effect that this is a selfless, charitable phase. You must therefore expect to put your own interests second if other people require your assistance. The only thing which is more important is your physical well-being. 
VIRGO, This week's stars smile on all Virgos with creative pursuits and artistic hobbies. Everyone born under this wonderful sign is heading for a series of fascinating social experiences. Everything is grist to your mill and you'll enjoy a wild outing one moment, a quiet night in, the next. 
LIBRA, Press ahead with all home improvements, particularly those involving the very fabric of your property - such as important repairs and decorating. Don't let anyone undermine you, especially as everything is set to go so very well. If plans are proceeding smoothly then don't interfere unless it's absolutely necessary. 
SCORPIO, You still need to keep a grip on the purse strings, although any financial partnership is likely to be profitable, especially if beautiful objects are on your shopping list. Your travel stars are now even stronger than last week, so get moving - or at least make plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, If your stars don't bring you a windfall, or some other remarkable stroke of financial luck now, they're just not doing their job. To an extent good fortune may be balanced by losses, but the net result should be well worth it - and make you feel so much better. 
CAPRICORN, In some strange way, events in the world at large are going to reflect the pressures and tensions in your private affairs. There is no logical reason why this should be so - it's purely due to the strange nature of astrology. You may be working over the weekend. 
AQUARIUS, There may not appear to be any bright light at the end of the tunnel just yet but, if you look carefully, you will see that life is in an exciting phase which should work out in your favour. You may be a little overworked in the process! Look after yourself. 
TAURUS, This is one of those profound moments when the planets draw your attention to higher spiritual truths. If you're in tune with your celestial patterns you'll act only out of the highest of motives. But, in relationships, what matters most is a mental rapport, a sense that you and your partner are on the same wavelength. 
GEMINI, The moment is now absolutely perfect for a windfall of some kind. The Gemini who doesn't end the weekend richer, or at least feeling much more prosperous, will be a rare and unfortunate creature. Even your relationships will be tangled up with what you can afford. CANCER It is difficult to imagine more helpful stars than those which currently occupy your chart. Your lunar picture is profoundly auspicious, especially for those of you who are having a party this weekend. Plus, a secret ambition will move one very discreet step forward. 
LEO, You have played to win - although the results have not always been exactly what you expected. Your current feelings don't reflect your real achievements, so look on the bright side. Is the glass half empty - or half full? It all depends on how you look at it - doesn't it? 
VIRGO, You may appear to be just slightly muddled - perhaps because your mind is elsewhere. Events over the next few days will show that the correct approach is flexible and romantic. At a time when your mood is about to change dramatically, you'll do well to keep your options open. 
LIBRA, If you are totally resistant to change you will be oblivious to today's emotional planetary picture, but if you are ready to move on, you will realise that life is becoming more adventurous by the day. Some of you will be driven by professional ambitions today, others by a need to come top in your community. 
SCORPIO, It may be a good idea to allow others' needs at home or at work to take precedence over yours. The reward for such selflessness will follow soon! Plus, you will both avoid a number of problems and find new vistas opening up. And, once that happens, you'll be ready to leap into the future. 
SAGITTARIUS, The entire world will be in a Sagittarian frame of mind. Mercury teams up with Jupiter, your ruling planet, in a marvellous pattern which enables you to seize the advantage. And not before time, you might say. Yet, while the pace is hotting up, the planets sound a warning against impatience. 
CAPRICORN, It's a confusing sort of a time. Partners may lack judgment, but their words will contain a core of wisdom that you'd ignore at your peril. Rarely do the stars combine such spiritual depth with amazing potential for pleasure. Plus, a spot of shopping therapy may lighten the atmosphere! 
AQUARIUS, Spare a thought for your general state of health, both emotional and physical, and get yourself into shape at every level of your being. Happily, romantic trends are positive but quiet. That gives you the chance to have your way with a minimum of fuss. 
TAURUS, Travel stars are reaching yet a new peak and you may be feeling strangely restless. Let me warn you, though, that this is no time for complacency. Drop your guard and you'll make a silly mistake, one which is so easily avoided: check, re-check and check again! 
GEMINI, There is no knowing where an invitation or proposal will take you now or over the weekend. It's very much a case of following the positive path and letting fate weave its wonderful web. You could be making rash promises, so ensure that you're prepared to follow them through. CANCER There is simply no way to get plans off the ground without the full support of partners and colleagues. Someone older or more experienced holds the key, perhaps in the form of financial backing. Your strong point now is your charm - and your irresistible ability to wrap partners around your little finger. 
LEO, It's time to pamper yourself. You're coming to the end of a period when there's been continual pressure on your expenses, but it's still too early to relax. Wait for the offers to flood in. Keep your diary open, just in case you get a better social offer! 
VIRGO, You may be pushed into making a snap decision but, if you know what's good for you, you will draw back from a final commitment. Romantic Virgos can expect events to move their way, and about time, too. But don't let anyone blame you for past misdemeanours - when they're not your fault! 
LIBRA, A battle royal is taking place between family commitments and worldly ambitions. The next major lunar pattern is seeing to it that the personal side of life will win out over your public duties. If you've felt hard-done-by recently, don't worry - you're about to turn the tables on a rival. 
SCORPIO, You may be inclined to act the firebrand. Far better, though, to stand aside and to let other people fight their own battles. There is absolutely no point in getting involved, especially as you might make a bad situation worse. Oh, and isn't it about time you told someone you loved them? 
SAGITTARIUS, The general mood should alter around early evening, taking you into more serious realms. Prepare for a change of plan and keep your schedule open for the next few days. A mystery could be cleared up, but, confusingly, there could be more than one answer. 
CAPRICORN, Life is certainly hotting up and you'll put the health of your relationships, both personal and professional, before everything else. Romantic Capricorns are in for a treat, but don't rush it - the next four weeks bring pleasant emotional planets. Be sceptical of amazing financial offers, though. 
AQUARIUS, Get things moving while a great many decisive planets are so very active. You must remember, though, that others have contributed to your happiness and offer them the recognition and gratitude they deserve. After all, while life is heading your way, you need to carry partners with you. 
TAURUS, The general drift of stars from the practical to the romantic indicates that it will be your legendary love of beauty and the pleasures of the flesh which come to the fore. This is a time for self-indulgence, for a little bit of what you fancy. In all relationships there is one priority: keep talking. 
GEMINI, It's one thing to dream of great riches, but quite another actually to make your first million. Yet, if you are looking for ways to supplement your income, the answer may lie in the arts - or in an area connected to water. If there's an emotional glitch it could relate to events which took place four weeks ago. CANCER You're setting off on an entirely new cycle of romantic experience - whatever your age, sex or inclination. It is time to be in love, and your stars are leaving you little space for anything else. Remember, though, when you're in control, you owe it to loved ones to look after their interests. 
LEO, Progress at work depends very much on how flexible you are in the face of vague instructions and uncertain commitments. This is not the time to embark on new undertakings or insist on punctuality and efficiency, especially not if you are wary of emotional entanglements. 
VIRGO, Compromise is a virtue, as you know only too well. You might have to shift your ground on a major matter. Aside from that, this is a brilliant moment for taking on major new responsibilities - and receiving rewards. Maybe a family member will be ready with the help you need. That's the least you deserve! 
LIBRA, Please don't complain about the many complications which seem to be flooding your life at the moment. If only you could see what is really happening, you'd realise that you're being showered with opportunities. Some may come from an unexpected direction, perhaps from a long way away. 
SCORPIO, It's a fine moment for declarations of romantic love. Many Scorpios will be writing poems to their loved ones. If you missed out on a recent invitation, now is the time to catch up. Don't worry about being sentimental - cliches are often the best way to persuade other people your feelings are genuine. 
SAGITTARIUS, Swing into action, lay everything on the line and surprise everyone with your amazing skill and vitality. Family responsibilities should take first place, but, then, I'm sure partners will remind you of that. Try to find some time for a friend in need. 
CAPRICORN, As a Capricorn, you're not known for your romantic proclivities, but that's because you're shy, not because you lack feelings. In fact, at times like these, your emotions are likely to be highly visible. You'll even be ready to take a risk - when you sense that the moment is right. 
AQUARIUS, It is unlikely that even you could have anticipated what is now taking place in your private life. However, you may be too busy to worry about certain of the irrelevant frills which obsess other people. At work, you're into a new phase in which it's who you know that counts, so cultivate all personal contacts. 
TAURUS, You may now hear from loved ones who are overseas or far away. Communications will also arrive before long from people from your past. Strange encounters will revive pleasant contacts and fond memories. It's all down to that emotional planet, Venus, which brings a gradual awakening to romantic possibilities. 
GEMINI, Consider your situation carefully. In business matters, as in other areas, it may be you who is owed an apology. So, why don't you look at the past - and try to figure out the best solution? You'd also be wise to avoid undertaking any dubious commitments for the future! CANCER Planetary activity over the next few days will confirm what all sensitive people knew anyway - that the Cancerian vision is utterly remarkable in all respects. If you have creative goals on the go, put the emphasis on practical achievements - and let your imagination fly. 
LEO, Whatever you do, whatever you say, you won't be able to hide the fact that you're searching for something more meaningful in your day-to-day existence. You know that someone, somewhere, is sending you fond thoughts. It's nice to think that they're on your side even if they're a long way away. 
VIRGO, There is plenty of space for your Virgoan qualities of efficiency and order. But if you start trying to dominate the situation and insist that everything is in its proper place and that others live up to their promises, you may be facing an uphill struggle. 
LIBRA, Even more than in the past, it's vital to remember that Libra is the sign of balance. You occupy a pivotal role, standing at the fulcrum of everything that's happening. It's all quite a responsibility but, by next week, you'll be ready to take on any number of new commitments. 
SCORPIO, You share superb travel stars with a close partner. Short journeys are more likely to be for business, longer trips for pleasure. Careful organisation, though, is absolutely vital. And one other thing - partners have the best ideas, so listen carefully. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your birth-sign is ruled by the optimistic planet, Jupiter, which largely accounts for some of your better qualities - your wisdom, for example. Your ability to see ahead is central to your current ambitions, but there's a social factor at work, and that means you're best off as part of a team. 
CAPRICORN, Deep down you should realise that you have more to gain than to lose from current personal disputes. You may even come to understand that criticism and differences of opinion are all for the best. And with Mercury still so positively placed, your intuitions will be right - at least, most of the time! 
AQUARIUS, Certain colleagues and associates naturally hope that you will run out of steam, perhaps because you've worn them out over the last six months. If so, I'm afraid their hope is a vain one. Your ideas, especially at work, are likely to be even more lively than usual. 
TAURUS, Mercury's friendly challenge to your chart is an indication of rare poetic charm. Among those Taureans who are in for special treatment this week, are all involved in education, the law, travel and communication. There are also distinctly hopeful signs for those of you with professional ambitions under way. 
GEMINI, You'll be eager to weigh in with your assessment of the facts but I'm afraid that your judgment may be a bit faulty. You see, Mercury, which rules your razor-sharp brain, is currently a little rusty. It's also inclined to blow tiny details into major issues of principle. CANCER Your grip on the figures needs to be sharper. Plus, it's time to wallow in the fact that you were born a caring, compassionate, artistic, creative, poetic and soulful Cancerian. Your romantic and emotional stars are about to take a turn for the better, by the way! 
LEO, Confusion and chaos are not a necessary part of the week's personal developments, but will creep in if you imagine that it's possible to carry on as before. Great subtlety is required, especially if partners come to feel that you have let them down. Even if you haven't, you may still have to reassure them. 
VIRGO, The real advances over the coming month will be made in social areas. Lovers, close friends and even strangers will all offer you the stimulation and support you need and deserve. Looking ahead, your financial situation is about to shift gears, so get up to date with yourself, now. 
LIBRA, A sensational aspect to a sensitive sector of your solar chart is encouraging your artistic inclinations. Be sure to keep everything clear and above board at work and set out to impress individuals in authority. You may postpone a number of practical matters until certainty returns. 
SCORPIO, You're fond of laying down the law, but do think long and hard before issuing any directives or ultimatums. Teach by example and don't think that just because you espouse a particular set of standards or ideals, other people should agree with you. You see, what works this week may not be so effective next week. 
SAGITTARIUS, The best advice I can give you is to accept a personal dilemma philosophically. If you find this difficult, try ignoring stressful developments and embark on an entirely different course. You need to think very carefully in all work and routine matters - if you jump the gun, you'll miss one vital detail. 
CAPRICORN, In spite of an unusual amount of irritation in the heavens, you are afforded a unique opportunity to completely rearrange your plans. You see, difficulties and rewards always go hand in hand in the zodiac. You could even turn a legal hitch or ethical question to your advantage. 
AQUARIUS, Everything that came to light in a roundabout way must now be analysed and understood. It seems most likely that, before very much longer, you will have reached a much deeper understanding of your own purpose in this life. If you get the larger pattern figured out, you'll make sense of a number of otherwise meaningless, personal developments. 
TAURUS, Your nomadic tendencies are growing more insistent by the day, and Taureans who are taking time off this week are fortunate indeed. If you're at home, you must find ways to spice up your existence. A new interest could take hold, but you do need to think big. 
GEMINI, If you're a typical Gemini of the old school you'll be in your element this week. There'll be disagreements, debates and differences of opinion galore - and plenty of opportunities for you to get your spoke in. But listen to your dreams - they make more sense than the facts. CANCER Your stars are entering another of those delightful alignments which encourage your hopes and stimulate your imagination. It's all down to the Moon's imminent and intriguing encounter with the Sun; it looks as if destiny is picking you out for special treatment. 
LEO, This week's trends reinforce everything that was said about your chart last week. Your stars confirm that you are in an idealistic and selfless mood, though confusion is likely to creep in whenever the nebulous planet, Neptune, comes into play - and that's about every other day. 
VIRGO, You are still in the driving seat, although you should begin to tie up all loose ends. I'd like to remind you that at work it's who you know and not what you know that's important. You should therefore get on and cultivate personal contacts, much as this may go against the Virgoan grain. 
LIBRA, The present is still slightly confused, but the future is coming fast - so get ready. Everything has to be faced with confidence. You really cannot bury your head in the sand any longer, and only Librans who act decisively, and with self-confidence, will come through intact and in control. 
SCORPIO, It's a time for lofty ideals and noble sentiments. Just don't be so pompous and self-righteous that others are turned off! Leave financial initiatives until the middle to end of the week, for it seems that there may still be other circumstances to consider. 
SAGITTARIUS, Once again money and financial security are the issues of the week. I hope I will encourage you by pointing out the truly stupendous prospects for gain and profit that await the canny among you. You'll help your cause if you loosen up your thinking processes and consider new ideas - however unusual. 
CAPRICORN, One group of planets is attempting to knock you sideways while another struggles to hold you upright. It is not surprising that you feel buffeted by the winds of change. In fact, it is quite natural that you should. Your romantic mood is shifting, and over the next month you'll need to feel more secure. 
AQUARIUS, There's plenty of room for you to bring out your famous Aquarian radicalism this week and show people just what an anarchist you are. Yet, complex factors indicate that you're more likely to be a secret revolutionary, prepared to consider sweeping changes in your lifestyle. 
TAURUS, A threatened financial crisis may fail to materialise, much to everyone's relief. Midweek favours domestic routine and family gatherings, but you may be too busy to appreciate what's on offer. Romantic tendencies are already improving, and love is on the way. 
GEMINI, The week's stars may not be a hundred percent perfect, but I'd give them a good nine out of ten. The foolish Gemini will stick to his, or her, routine. The wise Gemini will throw caution to the wind and take a few well-calculated risks. But remember, a good gambler always works out the odds first — and goes on to win. Cancer The Moon, your planetary ruler, smiles loftily on your efforts early in the week, so you will cope with domestic battles and lingering family disputes with your usual skill. The odds are firmly stacked in your favour, but you will throw everything away if you fail to check certain fundamental details. 
LEO, Venus, goddess of love, is completing its excursion through sensitive regions of your chart, so you will soon have one last chance to complete a whole series of emotional, social and romantic ambitions. Go for it! The same stars also indicate that a financial gamble may finally pay off — hopefully. 
VIRGO, You should by now be feeling the first ripples of optimism as Jupiter's benevolent presence permeates your chart. Yet it does seem that vital monetary questions must still be answered. You have a reputation for being shy but you are shortly to defy and abandon other people's misleading images of you. 
LIBRA, A number of lively planets are jostling for attention this week and you may expect a welcome surprise. One word of warning: don't insist on punctuality, efficiency or reliability. The whole point about the current personal situation is that your willingness to compromise will win friends. 
SCORPIO, Ask yourself why you are so reluctant to come clean over a number of important plans. Perhaps, though, it's for the best that partners are kept in the dark for just a little while longer. At work an employer or other authority figure will have to be placated by the middle of the week. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your social stars are fine, mainly if you're in a mood to do something different - radically different. Time is moving on, and the same old pattern is no longer enough for you. Try spending your way to happiness. A lasting romantic relationship must be based around a new shared activity. 
CAPRICORN, The Sun and Mercury, Uranus and Neptune are all planets to be considered this week, and what an inspired foursome they are. By the end of the week, you should have cried ‘Eureka' as you suddenly realise what life's all about. If you do stumble across any cosmic secrets, be sure to write them down before they're forgotten. 
AQUARIUS, Venus maintains its warm glow and secure identity, encouraging you to take emotional risks. Isn't it about time you told someone else just exactly how you feel about them? And if you're still cautious, try talking to a trusted friend or ally first. 
TAURUS, Still, there's no let-up from planetary pressures. However, if you talk about personal feelings you may find that the old adage, a problem shared is a problem halved, is more true now than it ever was before. Next, you'll have to deal with all the financial implications. 
GEMINI, Chance encounters will lead to a much more fulfilling lifestyle for you and your loved ones. Yet I can't pretend that everything will be easy, and some of the people you encounter over the next few days may try your patience to the limit - and beyond! CANCER Shopping trips are bound to involve higher costs. Indeed, almost every area of life is going to work out more expensive than you hoped. You must talk about your problems, otherwise you'll have to accept the sole blame for any mistakes. Get expert help whenever you need it. 
LEO, A brilliant aspect between the Sun and a series of other planets, places hurdles in your path. Life is like an obstacle-course featuring traps for the unwary but big prizes for the winners. Long-distance journeys are strongly signified by the Moon. 
VIRGO, You may be misunderstood. However, your strength at the moment lies in repairing the damage left by people who have no control over their feelings. If your confidence should dip, then remember that you're playing a long game and you need a reliable strategy. 
LIBRA, This is bound to be one of those times when you don't see eye to eye with partners and loved ones, especially if money is involved. Spending or saving plans could provide the catalyst for a lively exchange of views. But, then, if you get financial concerns sorted out, emotional strains will be eased. 
SCORPIO, What a dull old world it would be if everyone agreed all the time. A frank exchange of views is inevitable, but do try not to fly off the handle or take everything too personally! You're a little bit accident-prone, so please use care with the priceless heirlooms. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have waited too long for the rewards you deserve, but you may have realised that you won't get anything you haven't worked for. By next week, you'll be able to figure out how to get round a recent delay. One word of advice: take steps to get into tip-top physical form. 
CAPRICORN, Lunar alignments anchor you to reality, but those of you pursuing romantic adventures may be swept off your feet. In spite of a general argumentative atmosphere, the chances of a very pleasurable windfall are much higher then average! Take your chances! 
AQUARIUS, You seem to have the edge at home and you can, if you wish, get your own way. Remember that, as far as family members are concerned, causes of discontent are still very much alive. If you put your mind to it, this is a time when one major financial or personal obstacle can be surmounted. 
TAURUS, Still, there's no let-up from planetary pressures. However, if you talk about personal feelings you may find that the old adage, a problem shared is a problem halved, is more true now than it ever was before. Next, you'll have to deal with all the financial implications. 
GEMINI, Chance encounters will lead to a much more fulfilling lifestyle for you and your loved ones. Yet I can't pretend that everything will be easy, and some of the people you encounter over the next few days may try your patience to the limit —  and beyond.

CAPRICORN, Lunar alignments anchor you to reality, but those of you pursuing romantic adventures may be swept off your feet. In spite of a general argumentative atmosphere, the chances of a very pleasurable windfall are much higher then average. Take your chances. 
AQUARIUS, You seem to have the edge at home and you can, if you wish, get your own way. Remember that, as far as family members are concerned, causes of discontent are still very much alive. If you put your mind to it, this is a time when one major financial or personal obstacle can be surmounted. 
TAURUS, This is very much a time to behave like a true Taurean - resolute, responsible and keen to retain all that is best from the past. However, please be very aware that at particular moments you will be obliged to compromise. So, you'd better start looking for an escape route. 
GEMINI, There does seem to be a real chance that the emotional strain of the current times will have an adverse effect on your health. Bearing in mind that astrology deals with prevention rather than cure, don't let this week's irritating stresses and strains get to you. CANCER Your lunar alignments remind you of the importance of professional activities and ambitions. In some strange way, work may be a means for you to provide yourself with emotional security, or a feeling that you have a genuine role in the world. 
LEO, A number of long-term commitments may have come under increased scrutiny, but that's no reason to walk away from a responsibility. It may be more useful to you to stick around for a while and see exactly what can be worked out. Partners may be prepared to do more than their fair share - if you ask nicely. 
VIRGO, Mercury is still exerting a powerful pull over your sign, and will do so for another eight weeks. This is an indication of celestial protection which should see you recover from current battles and pass unscathed through the next two months' worth of ups and downs. 
LIBRA, Although the celestial relationship between Mars and the Sun is placing you under personal pressure, others are barking up the wrong tree if they imagine they can out-manoeuvre you. Conciliation is the key, but only you have the instinctive sense of what needs to be said - and done. 
SCORPIO, A family or domestic matter may be settling down, but professional Scorpios are not out of the woods just yet. Remember one piece of vital advice: a good general never starts a battle that can't be won. The struggle you're facing, though, should be a war of words. 
SAGITTARIUS, Personally and emotionally, things are likely to remain uncertain, partly because others are vacillating and unwilling to make a decent commitment. Even those who do make arrangements are liable to break them! That's why you should keep your options open. 
CAPRICORN, If you use finances as a bait, you could be taking a big risk. Either other people may accept you at face value, or you may let yourself in for commitments you can't keep. Put home and family first, for it's the people who know you best who will stick by you. 
AQUARIUS, Venus, planet of love, is approaching a single degree of your solar chart which denotes your relationships. You should therefore feel only optimism for the future, no matter what current events suggest; if you hope for the best then the best is more likely to happen. 
TAURUS, It is almost impossible to say whether today's lunar alignments will soothe your troubled brow or further obscure your view of reality. So much depends on your skill in handling difficult people. You may be about to impress with your success in soothing a hot-tempered colleague. 
GEMINI, The truth of the matter, whether professional or personal, will be obvious next week, so just hold on a little while longer. In the meantime, there's probably no respite from hard work. Don't exhaust yourself, though. You'll be no use to anyone if you're fed up and flat on your back. CANCER Emotional difficulties brought about by the challenging and change-inducing alignments of Venus, Mercury and Pluto, are surely enough to try the patience of a saint. But there is no reason why you shouldn't give up and walk away from responsibilities which are no longer worthwhile. 
LEO, You may still be feeling a little surprised by recent announcements and you might have to be fast on your feet if you are to regain the initiative. Pay more attention to financial affairs under today's mildly confusing lunar alignments. But don't take final decisions unless you are one hundred and one percent sure. 
VIRGO, Your ideas are fine, but it may take someone else to stiffen your resolve and make you commit yourself to a particular course of action. The Sun may make information difficult to come by, though. But, then, perhaps there really is nothing at all to find out! 
LIBRA, The Moon's sway over a sector of your horoscope ruling work and self-sacrifice indicates that this is not the time to abandon your responsibilities or renege on commitments. Your deeply complex planetary patterns advise you to stick to your guns. 
SCORPIO, I don't want to keep harking on about the same old things, but you're still passing through an emotional minefield which could set off fireworks in almost any area, personal or professional. Being a Scorpio, though, you are well fitted to cope with life's little mysteries. 
SAGITTARIUS, It will be worth your while to offer an olive branch to partners and associates. Remember those wise sayings about forgiving seven times seven and turning the other cheek: your concern for others should win out over self-interest. Plus, a younger relation may provide good advice. 
CAPRICORN, Venus and Jupiter are offering you generous help via close partners, but you may have to ask first. This is no time for reticence, so push yourself to the front of the queue. The Capricorn who thrives will be he, or she, who abandons normal reserve and shows a bit of bare-faced cheek. 
AQUARIUS, Although certain individuals are quite pleasant to your face, you know that you might not have been told the entire, unadulterated truth. On the other hand, relationships at work are really quite profitable, and you may gain emotionally as much as financially. 
TAURUS, For all your energy and determination, you appear to be confused in several important respects. The point is that, although your good qualities are being emphasised at the moment, partners will just have to be very understanding and sympathetic indeed. And you will have to be patient! 
GEMINI, Anything that disturbs your peace of mind must be dealt with, if only because you deserve to feel happy and relaxed. The last thing you want to do now is squander an opportunity. And if you're ahead of the game you'll already be tackling new wealth-generating opportunities. CANCER Money matters zoom up to the top of your agenda. This is neither a good thing, nor is it bad. It does, however, reinforce the suspicion that you really must get cash questions sorted out. You must also make sure that partners are happy - even if you don't feel like it! 
LEO, Colleagues and co-workers are bound to want more than you are prepared to give, but this will probably be the least of your problems. If you are able, turn your serious attention to spending plans. And if you're looking for a new job, the underlying trends are now moving in your favour. 
VIRGO, The positive aspect of current obstacles, hurdles and challenges is that you may become more experienced, self-confident and astute. You see, stars which are awkward for others are actually quite favourable for you. Fate certainly has some surprises in store! 
LIBRA, Your last word over family or domestic affairs has not been uttered. However, although underlying contradictions or complications may remain, the pressure to do something about them will be eased. And, as tension relaxes, so your optimism will grow. 
SCORPIO, Your lunar patterns are distinctly challenging, but looking on the bright side, such periods tend to stimulate you into new achievements. Or, to put it another way, the best lessons are sometimes the most difficult. So, if you meet challenges head-on, you'll be the winner in the long run. 
SAGITTARIUS, I suspect that many Sagittarians are slightly confused. One planetary force is drawing you towards everything that is routine, ordinary and mundane, while another is urging you to be profound and spiritual. What you've got to do is try and bring the two together. 
CAPRICORN, Creative aspirations and social passions seem to be at the centre of this week's stresses and strains. You may have strong feelings about certain people, and might do better not to get too closely involved. But then sometimes you just have to get in and stir the emotional pot. Can you resist the temptation? 
AQUARIUS, What magnificent times these are! Any adverse or challenging planetary influences signify that you are now presented with a remarkable opportunity to break the patterns and habits of a lifetime. The next stage is to continue with your plans in private. 
TAURUS, Today's planets push you forward with increasing speed. Your chances for personal success are now the best for a very long time indeed. Press on with established plans by all means, but avoid anything that may lead to confrontation or smacks of dishonesty. 
GEMINI, You may imagine that you know what is going on, but you are probably mistaken! Never have you been so likely to pick up the wrong end of the stick. Please take proper advice in all legal, foreign and travel matters, and that does mean double and even treble checking. CANCER Jupiter and Venus are as benevolent a pair of planets as you could wish to have watching over you. Generosity on your part will win friends and impress people, protecting you in the present and gaining you firm and loyal allies for the future. In other words, selflessness and self-interest are the same thing. 
LEO, With so much planetary activity taking place today, you'd do very well to take centre stage. Watch out for flying missiles, though, and duck if anything comes in your direction. Prepare for a shift in emotional gear and, while you're at it, get in touch with someone who is waiting to hear from you. 
VIRGO, I am sure that you have been put out, pushed around and generally had your interests ignored, but then that's all part of life's rich tapestry. This is no time to complain about the world being unfair. Instead, it's the moment to reach out and take control. 
LIBRA, In your personal life, you're on the scent of a new romantic adventure. Unexpected developments at work have not undermined your confidence or commitment. Far from it. If your professional or worldly ambitions have been dented, I suspect that the real cause lies elsewhere, perhaps in your own refusal to take the lead. 
SCORPIO, Today's lunar alignments are about the most intriguing they've been for a very long time. The news will be exciting, even for those of you who are enjoying placid times. It's all doubly significant if you have big, ambitious plans on the go. You choose! 
SAGITTARIUS, All the quite extraordinary planetary activity now taking place must be harnessed and used to channel your noble, virtuous and selfless instincts. You have a clear choice whether to go all out for personal interest or to realise that material security is, in the grand scheme of things, purely temporary. 
CAPRICORN, It's a day of significant planetary configurations, but whether you are directly involved in dramatic events, or merely a passive observer, is up to you. I take the view that the latter is more likely. In other words, you'll be looking, listening and learning. 
AQUARIUS, The approaching lunar patterns are among the most striking to hit your sign for a good few months. If you're not knocked slightly off course there'll be something wrong, for it means that you're not directly in tune with your stars! You'll be back in the saddle by the end of the week. 
TAURUS, The Moon begins the week sympathetically aligned with your sign, so you can afford to be thoroughly optimistic about everyone and everything. You can use any friendly conditions mid-week to make up for an unfortunate tiff - you just cannot afford emotional rifts with things as they are. 
GEMINI, Venus, planet of love and affection, is moving on, so you'll soon be passing from one personal cycle to another. If I were you, I'd make sure that all family relationships were on firm ground, and that no misunderstandings remain. Your feelings have changed, but partners' expectations will remain the same. CANCER You're building up to a series of planetary clashes and confrontations. In plain language this means that personally, professionally and emotionally you're about to embark on a whole new voyage of discovery and adventure. Sit back, relax and enjoy it! 
LEO, The major planet in your chart is still Mercury, which just happens to be the ruler of illusions and confidence tricks! Joking aside, there is no situation you can't get out of with some deft footwork - and perhaps by pulling the wool over somebody's eyes. 
VIRGO, Remember that, if you want to get on in the world at large, it's your personal relationships that count. This won't be the case next week, so exploit your undoubted charms while you still have time. You'll be entering an intriguing and secretive phase by the end of the week. 
LIBRA, The rapidly approaching alignment between the Sun and the Moon will trigger a number of welcome improvements in your circumstances, suggesting that you're heading for great things. Hopefully, you'll be pleasantly surprised when partners at last appreciate all the effort you've put in on their behalf. 
SCORPIO, Mercury will be completing a thoroughly indecisive and awkward series of planetary patterns. Please take my advice and refuse to rise to provocation, especially from employers or from people who think they know you better than you know yourself. Be charming as only a Scorpio can! 
SAGITTARIUS, Your chance to deal with financial questions may not come until the very end of the week. In the meantime, how about making personal relationships the key to a truly satisfying and contented week? Be sure to keep family differences in proportion. 
CAPRICORN, I'm not going to pretend that life isn't tiring at the moment, because it is. On the other hand, there is a great deal that you can do to help yourself and transform emotionally challenging situations into opportunities for great happiness. Don't let anyone hold you back. 
AQUARIUS, As the Sun and the Moon perform their celestial motions, it's time to sit up and make your physical well-being the number one priority. Don't get fanatical, but do clean up your diet and see that you're getting all the correct and appropriate exercise. And, also, of course get rid of lingering resentments. 
TAURUS, It's bound to be a little longer before you fully recover from last year's minor setbacks. In part, that's a tribute to the power of your memory. Today's lunar position offers travel as an escape route, but also advises you to check out the ethical implications: you want to do the right thing. 
GEMINI, The Sun and Mercury command you to stick to hard work today - and that's an order! Yet, other planets give completely contradictory advice, and if you're determined to enjoy yourself then you should aim for imaginative pursuits, not to mention those which could bring in extra cash. CANCER The art of compromise doesn't always come naturally, which is why you may now have a slight difficulty fitting in with others' plans. However, fit in you must. Also, be prepared to spend to support your romantic dreams. I don't mean that you should waste your cash, just utilise whatever is necessary. 
LEO, The Sun and Jupiter combine to stimulate the extravagant regions of your horoscope. This is a wonderful aspect for those of you who imagine that money grows on trees. The rest of you, take care! If Mars and Neptune mean anything, then it's that you're likely to lose control. Don't! 
VIRGO, For once, you may surrender yourself to total enthusiasm and give yourself over wholeheartedly to a special venture. If there's a choice between over-committing yourself or going without, you may go for the first option. You can sort out the details later. 
LIBRA, One way or another, you'll soon have to put the collective good before private interest. It's a fine time for everyone who is working to make the world a better place, or is otherwise dabbling in a charitable enterprise. Your reputation for honesty will do you good in the long run. 
SCORPIO, It's an ideal day for traditional occupations, perhaps because the future seems to be so dangerous. It's also a deeply significant moment for family relationships, with indications that things may never be quite the same again. Make sure that they're better! 
SAGITTARIUS, There'll be a minor clash of interests between home and work, or private ties and public ambitions. In actual fact, any difficulties may be in your imagination. You may continue to juggle all your commitments and keep all balls in the air at the same time. 
CAPRICORN, Family members are certainly going to be stuck fast unless they turn to you for help, advice and assistance. But then they may have trouble pinning you down. By all accounts your solar chart is in a peculiarly restless, adventurous and imaginative phase. 
AQUARIUS, You may as well forget your responsibilities and have fun - but only if you have a team of servants and staff to make sure that practical matters are well taken care of. As you can see, it's a complicated moment! No matter what your individual predilections, don't let others hold you back without good cause. 
TAURUS, One of the most important planetary aspects of the moment is that which cements friendships at work. The overwhelming priority now is to get on with people in authority. You may go for the best long-term options, and treat short-term temptations with a healthy scepticism. 
GEMINI, It's definitely traditional values which suit you best at the moment. This doesn't mean that you're a stick-in-the-mud reactionary, but that what appeals is the way things were done better in the past. And, having applied tried and trusted methods, you may set out your plans for the future. CANCER This is an ideal moment to set about building up future security, if only because you're no longer trapped in the past. If other people are refusing to play ball, it might be best for you to get on and seek out companions who are older, wiser and generally more suited to your current mood. 
LEO, You don't seem to have any choice but to press on with the job in hand. Happily, your lunar alignments indicate that you may throw caution to the wind and might walk away from a particular engagement without too much fuss. Don't leave anyone feeling let down and abandoned, though. 
VIRGO, The general situation continues to look favourable, but there's a heavy emphasis on those of you who have some sort of artistic or creative vocation. The rest of you may feel strangely dissatisfied, but you can do a lot to help yourself by looking for the deeper pattern which underpins your life. 
LIBRA, You do still have to be down-to-earth if you want to get on, but nothing is as simple as it seems. The most effective course may be to put fantasy first and facts second, strange as that may seem. The point is that you might solve practical problems by applying unlikely solutions. 
SCORPIO, It's a useful moment for discussions, debates and choices, and it really is time that you made up your mind. It is doubtful whether anyone else can do this for you, so search out the facts and then take the best decision you can. But don't imagine that it's final! 
SAGITTARIUS, One medium-term pattern in your horoscope suggests that you should try and talk to people at home much more often. And if you do this already then perhaps it's a case of making sure that they listen! It's not a question of chatting about daily affairs, but of getting to grips with deeper issues. 
CAPRICORN, The pursuit of happiness is an essential human right, and it's certainly one that you should be aiming for at the moment. If at all possible, you should draw family members into whatever good fortune comes your way. You may also bring together friends who have fallen out. 
AQUARIUS, You may give yourself as much time as you need to get your feelings in perspective. There is a lot to be said for putting pressure on people who don't yet seem to be responding to your blandishments. Mind you, in the final analysis you can't exactly make them agree with you! 
TAURUS, There is a very pleasant tendency in the air today, stimulated, as ever, by your friend, the Moon. The world will generally be moving in your favour, especially if you are happy to accept whatever turns up. Some people are bound to be in a touchy mood, and liable to over-react, so stay cool. 
GEMINI, Your planetary ruler, Mercury, is still making a series of very inspired aspects. These raise the tantalising prospect that you'll make a massive amount money. However, it will be very difficult to distinguish the one genuine opportunity from the ghosts and illusions which cloud your vision. CANCER There may be a battle for supremacy between your need for security and your desire to break loose, so you may feel deeply unsettled. This could therefore be a very useful point indeed to reconsider the past, take a fresh look at the present and make new plans for the future. 
LEO, You can and will derive lasting benefit from partners' little games and schemes, even if it doesn't look that way right now. The more you trust them to do what is right, the better the chance that they'll succeed. Rather than simply standing in their way, offer constructive advice. 
VIRGO, You should never forget that you are as creative as anyone else. In point of fact, at the moment your artistic potential seems to be rather greater than most other people's, and employers and people in authority forget this at their great cost. 
LIBRA, Since the Moon is now aligned with the very heart of your solar chart, you must fulfil all your domestic duties in full! The only way to escape is to give up the lot! Or enrol a team of willing helpers. Keep your sense of humour well to the fore and you'll survive with a smile. 
SCORPIO, Other people are often surprised when you are able to make up your own mind, and even more stunned when they realise you know what you're talking about. Their misunderstanding may give you the advantage, and you could already be at the finishing post before they've even started. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may expect additional costs today. It's almost inevitable that you'll have to deal with money, and it may even be rather exciting if you're able to bring out the latent capitalist within! Plus, a generous gesture may take you closer to your heart's desire. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon's helpful movement has two results. One is that your confidence should be growing. The other is that you're more sensitive. The best conclusion is that you'll be much more forthright about expressing your feelings than you were in the past. 
AQUARIUS, Venus and Mars are irresistible planets so, quite simply, you should be increasingly attractive! Actually, you can sabotage your own good fortune by deliberately refusing to co-operate. You should avoid such self-defeating actions, and help yourself by helping others. 
TAURUS, The professional situation is still quite clear, and this is an excellent moment for all ambitious types to both aim for promotion and to encourage very close relatives to do the same. Social prospects veer towards the unusual, by the way, so you should be prepared for a few surprises over the coming days. 
GEMINI, You should try to discover why colleagues or associates want to opt out of agreements and commitments. It may be that they instinctively know better than you what the real situation is. A financial question should be answered by the end of the week. CANCER You really should devote a little more attention to sorting out relationships at work. Ideally, you should be operating as part of a team, co-operating with colleagues almost as if they're part of your family. Hopefully you won't argue like you have done with nearest and dearest! 
LEO, Partners seem to hold the advantage, but that shouldn't be any bar to you enjoying yourself. In fact, the best fun you can have is by following other people's lead and joining in with whatever they suggest. You might actually find that you enjoy something that you'd always avoided. 
VIRGO, Do listen carefully to what partners are saying, and if you're at all telepathic, try and work out what they're thinking as well! On the other hand, before you act on what you hear, you'd better make sure you're correct! Keep an eye open for the occasional disagreement later on, when people around you get tired and touchy. 
LIBRA, Several factors seem to be making it easier for you to make up your mind. One could be increased support from family members. It's probably most useful to ask for moral support, rather than practical assistance. That way, you preserve the freedom to act as you wish. 
SCORPIO, Cost seems to be the major factor, and romantic plans may be inhibited by what you can and can't afford. This could be a good time to take a gamble, in which case emotional risks are as likely as financial. Remember that old saying - 'never fight a battle you can't win'! 
SAGITTARIUS, The financial situation should now have eased, but only temporarily. Use all and any new-found confidence to get yourself on a new and much more profitable path. What's more, you may put your foot down at home. On the other hand, there's no guarantee that partners will obey! 
CAPRICORN, You may keep all significant secrets to yourself for a little while longer, but you should have your story ready just in case someone else spills the beans. Your romantic hopes might just involve you in additional cost, so you should be prepared to shell out. 
AQUARIUS, There have been delays, but no matter what area of your life has temporarily stalled, you can bring in other people to help out. With the right tone of voice, you can even get them to do your dirty work for you, which is no mean feat! You might have to return the favour, later. 
TAURUS, You'd probably do well to take care of financial affairs today, especially joint arrangements. In other words, it's the optimum moment to settle debts and balance the books. The best period for professional initiatives is just around the corner, so make your plans now. 
GEMINI, If ever you dreamt of the perfect moment to seek a rise in your income, now could be it. The main advice is to look for an approach which is slightly out of the ordinary. You will, though, have to offer something unusual in return. But what might it be? The answer could be closer than you think. CANCER Your remarkable intuition, coupled with your innate Cancerian common sense, should be advising you to follow the line of least resistance. Assuming that partners are on hand to take care of the practical dimension, go for the most romantic and unrealistic choices. 
LEO, Even a long, drawn-out wrangle over finances should soon be settled. The best way out of a mess may actually be to work through the muddle, and then make a quick getaway! Have your fall-back position ready, and see to it that you're not trapped in a corner. 
VIRGO, It's time for a spot of lateral thinking, making connections which evade ordinary people, and finding answers in the most unusual places. You've got to forge the links which can help you break free from a current dilemma. The solutions may be just around the corner. 
LIBRA, A few smart moves could slash your domestic and routine chores. Labour-saving gadgets could help, as will delegation of duties to others. However, your main challenge will be to face the fact that certain long-held opinions must now be cast to the four winds. 
SCORPIO, You'll certainly have a few brilliant ideas, but whether they'll be of any use is quite another matter! It's probably best to play about with all your different options in a spirit of pure experimentation. If anything is finalised today it may be cancelled by the end of the week, so keep an open mind. 
SAGITTARIUS, The poetry in your soul is stirring, so it's time for emotional dreams and choices. The romantic situation is beginning to look decidedly more colourful for everyone in search of love. The point is, though, that you might form the most unexpected and surprising attachments! 
CAPRICORN, Certain family matters may be somewhat confusing, but there's nothing wrong with that. And there's probably nothing new in it either! What you need is a sense of humour, plus a realisation that if other people want to make mistakes, that is their business! 
AQUARIUS, You're plugging directly into deep wells of unconscious wisdom at the moment, so it's a perfect moment for coming up with strokes of genius. This development is directly applicable to your financial situation, and you may follow a hunch if you want to make a mint. 
TAURUS, As always when the Moon challenges your sign, as it does this week, close partners will take even little complaints as some sort of cue to have a go at you. Listen carefully, for there may actually be a great deal of sense in their ideas even if they sometimes choose the wrong words. 
GEMINI, If the day could be summed up in one word, it would be duty. This is, therefore, a moment to fulfil all your responsibilities and avoid all distractions, no matter what size, shape or form they come in. You may never know the trouble you'll avoid if you take a few simple precautions. CANCER The fact that passion is running high doesn't mean that you'll be falling in love or anything like that. What it does imply is that, whatever area of life you're involved in, a little enthusiasm will be worth more than a ton of experience. Oh, and don't take anyone - or anything - for granted. 
LEO, No doubt you imagine that others are having all the fun. Actually, the grass may indeed be greener on the other side, but that doesn't mean that you can join in. Bide your time for a little while longer, at least until someone special has made their mind up. 
VIRGO, The Sun and Mercury are on the move, which could mean that your normally impeccable judgment is slipping. And, in that case, watch out for financial pitfalls - and for the odd moral dilemma. It also happens to be a reasonable moment to rely on your intuitions, so follow a hunch if that looks like the best option. 
LIBRA, You may take your pleasures where you find them, but remember you will have to pay eventually. In point of fact, you might now be coming to realise the emotional cost of one particular personal venture. Oh, and at work, nothing less than the truth will do. 
SCORPIO, The Moon is aligned with a degree of your chart which traditionally denotes extraordinary intelligence! This I take as an indication that, for once, you'll have all the best ideas. But that doesn't mean that you'll know what to do about them! 
SAGITTARIUS, There is so much to say that the problem may be knowing where to begin. You may decide to follow a prudent path and keep certain ideas or feelings to yourself until you are sure that partners are ready. Also, take other people's feelings seriously, otherwise, they may grow increasingly resentful, and that would be a shame. 
CAPRICORN, Financial matters do seem to be growing steadily more important. What seems to be vital now is to make sure that people who should know better aren't allowed to rock the boat. You might find it impossible to keep order this week, however hard you try! 
AQUARIUS, The ball is in your court at the moment, and the best thing you can do today is to aim for enhanced status and prestige. You may show people how experienced you are and demonstrate that you are indeed the right candidate to take on increased responsibility. 
TAURUS, You may long to let up and lounge in a back seat while others take responsibility. Yet with the Sun, Moon, Mars and Pluto all lined up in significant sectors of your chart, you may have no choice but to gird your loins and stand up for yourself once again. More relaxed conditions will return soon. 
GEMINI, Venus and Jupiter are an absolutely splendid combination of planets. In fact, rarely have your stars been so inherently prosperous. But unless you keep your eyes open, the opportunities may pass you by. The best is yet to come, though and, within the next fortnight, you should have received a small windfall. Cancer Some of your planets remain resolutely romantic, dreamy, imaginative, sensitive and, above all, fortunate in love. There'll be moments when artistic and creative Crabs will be on top of the world, perhaps because there really does seem to be the chance of a breakthrough. 
LEO, You are bound to be caught up in events outside your control and you may as well accept that certain plans are bound to be postponed or delayed. No matter. The vacuum could be filled by excitement, drama and adventure beyond your wildest dreams. Family members require your sympathy and assistance. 
VIRGO, You don't usually let the world see how astute you are, but your management of family members and younger relatives is to be admired. Now that other people are in such an emotional mood, they will turn to you as the one individual capable of maintaining order. 
LIBRA, You may be tired of being singled out as the peacemaker, yet it's partly for your own peace of mind that you try to bring rivals and enemies together. This is a time of potential misunderstandings when it will be up to you to explain the truth and point out the facts. 
SCORPIO, Emotional turbulence is being whipped up by some stormy and very rare celestial alignments. You would be advised to devote a great deal of attention to all secret activities, and to encourage people who rarely express their emotions to speak their minds. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may keep travel plans to a minimum, fulfilling only long-term arrangements. For some reason, work or even health questions, may cause you to change your ideas. Important decisions are due to arise from serious and emotionally-charged discussions, and a loved one can help look for the answers. 
CAPRICORN, What a week this is, with all the planets at sixes and sevens. For once, though, your sign is steering clear of the celestial shock waves. You stand to benefit from gifts and generosity to an unprecedented degree. Romantic Goats can expect their dreams to be fulfilled. 
AQUARIUS, There is everything to be gained from bending in the wind and much to be risked from refusing to compromise. Only if you are ready for anything, should you follow the impulsive path which seems to be such an obvious option. Remember that special people are depending on you. 
TAURUS, You may sit down, talk to partners and listen very carefully to people who may have different ideas and a fresher perspective than you. You should accept criticism, no matter how much it may hurt your pride. After all, even you can be wrong sometimes! 
GEMINI, There is plenty of room for extra effort. If you are to safeguard your material security, you should work as hard as possible. In other words, there's no point in hoping that something will turn up! It is also a useful moment to get your physical condition into shape, by the way. CANCER Your tendency today will be to believe that only fresh creations are worthwhile, but don't throw out the baby with the bath water. You may swing into action socially, and make plans to test out your skills as a hostess or host. Your generous gestures will be repaid in full. 
LEO, Home affairs and family commitments may consume most of your emotional energy, so you may have little enthusiasm left for romantic adventures or leisure activities which excite you. There's a little extra tension at work; there might be sharp words, but don't take them too personally. 
VIRGO, Short trips are in order, which is convenient, but a psychological reading of your chart reveals that what is most important is dialogue and discussion, so take great efforts to make yourself understood. An exchange of ideas could even set you off on an entirely new course. 
LIBRA, Financial issues are about to shoot up the agenda, so stay on your guard, and don't make rash commitments. Also, don't make the mistake of under-estimating or under-valuing people who need your sympathy and support. You need to keep potential allies on your side. 
SCORPIO, You seem to have the upper hand today, even though this may come as something of a surprise. Please don't waste too much time wondering about what you should do next, but throw yourself in with gusto. At the very least you will learn from your mistakes! 
SAGITTARIUS, There is so much secrecy around, and you may be keeping certain feelings close to your chest. Partners may be equally reluctant to come into the open, but then there is no reason why they should - is there? Devote a little time to a charitable activity. 
CAPRICORN, Your social stars are good, if a little intense. The heaviest astrological pull is towards home and family life, but it may be a good idea either to get out and mix, or to invite other people around. A new acquaintance may provide just the tonic you need. 
AQUARIUS, It's an ambitious moment, and even leisure activities should be designed to attract prestige and respect. If family matters are on the agenda it could be parental connections which pre-occupy you, rather than responsibilities for children. Perhaps ghosts from the past still need to be laid to rest. 
TAURUS, You will reconsider the virtues of one particular emotional connection, but now may be the last time to take decisions about the future - at least until next week! At work, impulsive actions could be your downfall, so think first, act later, and take care of essential details. 
GEMINI, It's time for passion and, if there's no romance at the moment, direct your enthusiasm into other areas. Children will provide a useful focus, but only if you're prepared to let your hair down and let them take the lead. Artistic and creative pursuits also beckon. CANCER Although today's serious Moon reminds you of everything you haven't done at home, it may be too late, so don't feel too guilty! Please, though, resolve to do better next time around! For a start you can sort out the financial implications before you get sucked in too deep. 
LEO, You may have said or done something that you now regret, but what's said cannot be taken back. It may be a better use of your time to press on with practical tasks at home. If travelling, allow for delays. And if someone is on your mind, get in touch and find out how they are. 
VIRGO, The moment has come to exert your independence and authority in the realm of ideas. In other words, say your piece and make sure that others sit up and take notice. Don't be unduly concerned by financial tremors, by the way, for help is at hand. 
LIBRA, The Moon is lively, active and friendly in some senses, serious and sober in others - an indication that you should take the initiative and bring important plans to fruition very quickly. Above all, be sure to leave no loose ends, especially if rivals are waiting to trip you up. 
SCORPIO, Something may happen which is rather confusing, but the answer may lie under your nose. It's all a question of opening your eyes and looking in a different direction. Also, you may realise that you have a great deal more emotional power than you imagine. 
SAGITTARIUS, A social engagement may be up for review, even cancellation, partly because you may be feeling weary at the thought of mixing with particular people. Actually, it could do you good to spend a little time in quiet contemplation. You might emerge feeling younger, fresher and full of life. 
CAPRICORN, You should turn your attention to social issues, perhaps reviving plans for a party or gathering of some sort. At work you must set great store by team-work, but also begin to look at the larger picture, seeing the wood for the trees - just for a change! 
AQUARIUS, You may have been coasting along, imagining that you have all the time in the world to achieve a cherished ambition. You might be very, very wrong, and if you don't swing into gear now, you could miss a vital chance in about twelve weeks' time. And that would never do. 
TAURUS, LOVE AND ROMANCE It could be you, not other people, who will be responsible for any emotional upsets this year. That's good news for it follows that you'll be able to do something about them and restore good feeling. You'll have fun, but other people will be maddened by your sudden changes of mood and highly perplexed by your strange and contradictory statements. May might be your most exciting month, but October could be the most rewarding, just as long as you remember that other people have their own feelings and desires. If you expect everyone to behave as you wish, then you could be heading for big trouble. So what can you do? Trusting other people might be a good start. WORK AND MONEY You are driven by deep passions, although your emotions don't always coincide with the jobs that are on offer. Your need for privacy and your commitment to group activities will intensify in February, when you will be questioning your long-term plans; it could be that you will be forced to give up a responsibility. June and July may be your most expensive months and you may hit an extravagant devil-may-care mood. Career-wise, don't become too bogged down in details. It's your longer term hopes and wishes which matter now, so broaden your horizons. And, when September and October come round, keep your options open and always have a fall-back position at the ready. HOME AND FAMILY Be patient, take your time and you'll win the day while learning from partners' mistakes. There'll be many occasions when you will be called upon to put things right for someone close to you who has suffered a major setback. At times like these a bit of emotional letting-go is necessary, which is not easy for you. Don't let work demands tempt you to neglect your family commitments later in the year, even if you may be eager to press ahead with setting up a new professional collaboration. As December opens, you may feel that partners and family members are trying to undermine you. Talk to them and you may find that the opposite is the truth. TIP FOR THE YEAR The world is your oyster. 
GEMINI, LOVE AND ROMANCE By a happy coincidence Venus, goddess of love, occupies friendly positions in April, July and November, an indication that at these times your relationships should be running smoothly, during a year when many people close to you will be under extra strain. August initiates a level of passion which may take you by surprise, but by late September you'll be back on an even keel. Whatever takes place at the beginning of October will colour events in November, encouraging you to be more emotionally creative — but also more businesslike. Once you know what you really need, you can go out and get it. WORK AND MONEY Once again, your horoscope is devoted to work. Not just work but your broader professional ambitions, your desire to fulfil your destiny to be the first and foremost in all human activities. It looks very much as if you will repeatedly place family commitments and romantic hopes in second place, although the New Moon in June will oblige you to deal with urgent demands at home. Mars' exciting movements in September will bring you some of that famous crusading spirit for which you are so well known. HOME AND FAMILY Pressure at home comes and goes, mainly because generous Jupiter alternately encourages you to feel good about life — and then dumps responsibilities in your lap. You can expect a number of changes in January, February and March, some of them to your liking, others not so welcome. The trouble is that you won't quite know what direction to move in.The reality is that from June to August the planets are deliberately complicating matters in order to give you the greatest possible experience, which will come in useful in the future. Keep an eye on younger relations in November, and get in touch with family members who are far away: it's time to build bridges and mend fences. TIP FOR THE YEAR Think big. CANCER LOVE AND ROMANCE Partnership is vital to you, yet this year you'll be struggling to stand on your own two feet, liberated from the dependence on the past. February brings a shake-out, probably because you'll decide that enough is enough. Your best time romantically speaking should coincide with Venus' aspect to your House of Marriage in June, and you'll be revealing deep emotional secrets. Press ahead with whatever actions are necessary to guarantee your future success. The New Moon in October raises the chance of a major invitation — but are you ready? Perhaps not. WORK AND MONEY Upward and onward — that's your motto. Yet when you get into a professional tangle after April your best approach may be to act only out of the highest of motives. If you have other people's interests at heart as much as your own, you will be above criticism. Those of you who have planned a brief holiday early in the year are also in tune with your planetary influences, for it is good to broaden your horizons. All of you will discover that overseas contacts are more important than you once thought. Plus, you are specifically due to gain if you are involved in any legal questions or are pursuing educational ambitions. HOME AND FAMILY When powerful planets stimulate travel regions of your chart early in the year they indicate that you will either be going abroad for family reasons or that a long-lost relation will come knocking at your door — or, at least, one you haven't see for far too long. Domestic concerns make it difficult for you to have a leisurely holiday later in the year, so keep well on top of all your routine commitments and you'll make it more possible to get away at a time of your choosing. You'll have plans of your own at the end of the year but a fear of rejection left over from the past may have been holding you back; if so, now is the time to get to grips with it. TIP FOR THE YEAR Life is not a rehearsal — so give it your all. 
LEO, LOVE AND ROMANCE Venus will be passing through practical zones in January and February, suggesting that these will be both prosperous — and happy and sociable, not to mention the increasing chance of a major move. A fresh acquaintance in April could form the basis of a powerful new friendship in July. You'll be working in close harmony with your stars if you keep a watchful eye open for ways of making extra money at home. Push through profitable transactions and make use of your exceptional charm to persuade people that your ideas are best. WORK AND MONEY No less than eight planets are firmly on your side in the early part of the year, with helpful consequences not just for your money, but all joint finances. Your business situation is bound to improve by July, just as long as you can make the most of the opportunities which come your way. You may be spending wildly in August, but should adopt a sensible saving policy in September, working for the future and seeing to it that you have cash set aside for those all-important social costs. At work, there's one key rule: take colleagues seriously, and don't imagine they're joking. HOME AND FAMILY Family members can be so argumentative: sometimes you'll tear your hair out at their inability to see sense. So, look at the problem practically: you'll have to do some difficult negotiating early in the year but, if you get the right words out at the right moment, the most obstinate individuals will melt. If you take a property gamble it will be a lesson to you, and remember that there's something to be said for learning from your mistakes and getting it right next time round. December could be a month of domestic and family transformation, so be certain you're in the driving seat and can ensure that everyone's hopes are fulfilled. TIP FOR THE YEAR Dream away. 
VIRGO, LOVE AND ROMANCE It's a positive period. Pressures are lifting and this is a year in which to re-evaluate your needs and desires in relationships, and look anew at what it is exactly that you want from people who attract you. February, May and November are the months in which you can expect the most significant developments. All your relationships will be changing fast in February, May highlights romantic feelings and November heralds the need to bring all your relationships into line with your real requirements. WORK AND MONEY Jupiter's continuing passage through your chart holds out the promise of quite exquisite financial rewards. However, this planet's motion is highly cautious, and at the moment it is still refusing to commit all its power to your cause. You may therefore have to be patient for a little longer. One key period is February-March when affectionate Venus enters the scene, bringing the prospect of close and profitable business relationships. This is a sensitive period when you may have one last chance to finalise a particular arrangement or involve a special person in your plans. HOME AND FAMILY You'll be asking yourself if there's anything you've left undone at home in the past and, if there's anything you can now do to make amends, you'll do so without delay. Family members will be making demands on your time and asking you what you're up to in the middle of the year — so have your story ready. The trouble is that you're in a secretive mood at the moment and inclined to keeping your ideas to yourself after June. But you'll also be inspired to crusade for your dreams and fight for what you believe is right. TIP FOR THE YEAR Think not what the world can do for you — but what you can do for the world. 
LIBRA, LOVE AND ROMANCE You may discover the true cost of a romantic commitment in March, aware of just how you much you might gain as well as how much you may give. Seven planets will be boosting your social prospects during March, and you might be moving into an entirely new circle of friends. One or two events may be rather fraught but, on the whole, this will be a rewarding period. Mars and Venus will be in compatible regions in July, so this looks like your best month socially and romantically. You'll be combining confidence with sensitivity in just the right balance. October brings one last, pleasant burst of passion. WORK AND MONEY Work and social life also seem to intermingle and you will be looking up old friends with a view to pursuing joint activities, sometimes to do with work or making money, but not always strictly so. The bigger picture is the rise on your creative powers and the necessity to make your professional affairs a direct outcome of your need to satisfy your deeper potential. There'll also be a number of travel openings although it's equally likely that you'll be on the end of an internet connection creating international contacts. A project that seemed a good idea earlier in the year may have to be cancelled by November — but that might be a huge relief. HOME AND FAMILY Family affairs could be exciting. You might be engaging in, and enjoying, discreet personal relationships which could also involve you in foreign travel. You may well wonder exactly where you're heading, but events after March and April will help clear up your doubts and hesitation, and make you realise more truthfully what your motives are. October could be your best domestic time. Sure, it may be a little pricey but it's excellent for socialising. Eventually your attention will be turning to your long-term security and you will be battening down the hatches in preparation for a safe and happy future. TIP FOR THE YEAR Enjoy your ambitions — and work hard at your pleasures. 
SCORPIO, LOVE AND ROMANCE This is a time of mystery and dreams, a period when you're asking, who am I and where am I going and, more importantly, who with? And, when nothing is clear, be prepared to sit back and enjoy the ride. Venus, planet of love, changes signs repeatedly, bringing indications of a discreet romance which, in July, it ushers into the open. Although your celestial patterns in the last half of the year are pleasant, it won't be all plain sailing; the most remarkable astrological configurations are never the easiest, and at the time it may appear that nothing very much is happening; it is only when you look back at times like these that you realise how extraordinary they are. WORK AND MONEY Saturn, the celestial taskmaster, will be creating order in your professional affairs. There's also a great deal to be said for getting on with professional ambitions in a discreet and co-operative manner, avoiding the pitfalls that arise when you fail to consult other people. You'd also be strongly advised to pay more attention than usual to your social commitments, not least because in March and April a friend may open a new door in business. There's bound to be some sort of crisis at work in August-September, and you'll emerge very much stronger and more in control; if you've discussed your intentions with other people, taken practical advice and covered all your options, you'll be in an excellent position. HOME AND FAMILY You will be affected by a series of intense planetary aspects acting in a suitably harmonious fashion. Those four great planets, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto will be prodding you in a firm but friendly fashion into discovering your sense of purpose. From August onwards various planets will be picking up speed, encouraging mysterious developments and quietly creating conditions you require for domestic success. Now is the time to leave insecurity, uncertainty and lack of self-confidence behind, replacing these negative aspects of your nature with belief in your own destiny. TIP FOR THE YEAR Opt for long-term friendships and deep commitments. 
SAGITTARIUS, LOVE AND ROMANCE You may expect a small romantic upheaval early in the year — hopefully a thoroughly pleasant one. Partners may be hard to understand this year, which may not surprise you. It's just that there'll be moments when their motivation seems complicated and their demands contradictory. You'll have your work cut out dealing with difficult individuals. But everything changes when other people try to woo you and you'll be more than a little uncertain what the best course of action may be. At times you'll feel like confronting partners, at others you'll be tempted to seduce them with your charm. Maybe you'll do both. WORK AND MONEY You could be on the verge of a professional breakthrough, but it is absolutely essential that you prepare for the consequences in your home and family life. If anything, you'll be a little too happy-go-lucky in June when a group of planets will meet in a creative and adventurous region of your chart. Although this is an excellent time to increase your income on the basis of hard work, you should be exceedingly wary of any speculative schemes. Mercury, Mars and Venus will form a powerful alliance later in the year, encouraging you to go for broke. HOME AND FAMILY What you really need is security - and a strong emotional anchor. This applies as much to those of you who are on the move as to those who are stuck in a rut. But as soon as you feel safe and secure, then you'll be looking for other involvements, and it might be charitable activities that attract you, or it may be that a favourite leisure activity suddenly propels you into a new social scene. In October and November, you may have to retake decisions that you thought had been firmly reached last year, perhaps in the light of fresh information. TIP FOR THE YEAR Put one hundred and ten percent effort into achieving your goals. 
CAPRICORN, LOVE AND ROMANCE You can count on friendly planets improving your social position, but it's up to you to accept them, or refuse. Your future happiness depends on that simple ability to choose. Ultimately your romantic contentment relies on whether you want to concentrate on your career or on private passions. Your need for emotional security grows stronger and, as the months pass, you will be prepared to do whatever it takes to make relationships work. That's very praiseworthy and bodes well for your future success. WORK AND MONEY You may be unable to concentrate on anything except financial matters early in the year. If someone is in debt to you or owes you a major favour this may take quite a bit of unravelling and you may have to decide whether to pursue it to the end or give up and cut your losses. By the end of mid-year your concern over money will have shifted and you may be thinking that a change of tack at work is the obvious answer to your problems. May is a fine month for a fresh start and there should be powerful indications that you may be in line for a minor promotion at work. You may need to face certain, perhaps unwelcome, facts, concerning colleagues, but be fair and impartial, get to the truth and everyone will be happier. HOME AND FAMILY Pressures at home will ease during January and February and the demands of domestic chores will be diminishing. However, don't become too complacent, as if you slip into a comfortable rut early in the year, you'll be rudely awakened before too long. The New Moon in June crystallises your emotional hopes. This means that there's definite scope to take the initiative and embark on one or two remarkable escapades. In September the only drawback will be a sense of the serious side of life which will emerge just as you're about to have some fun. TIP FOR THE YEAR Be generous and expect nothing in return. 
AQUARIUS, LOVE AND ROMANCE Although your romantic stars are bright in March and April, and again in July, personal relationships may take second place to your worldly ambitions. Venus and Mercury will both be on your side in April, a happy and poetic combination which will boost your spirits and enhance your outlook on life in general and your intimate romantic prospects in particular. Yet no one would pretend that this will be an easy time. Instead, you'll be kept under pressure, the planets continually driving you to try for new achievements. You'll be in no mood to accept second-best. Happily, Venus' passage through adventurous parts of your chart, closes the year on a contented note. WORK AND MONEY Your professional mood is dominated by wise and witty Mercury, which is due to take up residence in friendly and supportive sectors of your chart. This is all to the good and should help maintain a sense of equilibrium and a feeling that life is basically on the right track. However, in May and June, it may be a matter of one step forward, two steps back and all affairs, both personal and professional, are likely to meet delays. Please accept it as normal if colleagues seem to change their minds, employers cancel arrangements or financial ventures appear to run into the ground. It will all work out just fine in the end. HOME AND FAMILY All family members must have their say if you're planning changes in your living conditions. After all, decisions which you take now could affect them for a long time. As the month progresses, you'll have more time for relaxing and there's a joyful celebration in the pipeline. However, people around you seem determined to create disturbances, and your financial situation could be under threat. News which arrives during November may not be welcome to start off with, but if you sit down and think carefully about what a friend is really trying to say, a different picture could emerge. If a short trip seems necessary then don't delay. TIP FOR THE YEAR Go for broke in November 
TAURUS, A word about your physical well-being would come in handy, for this looks like a useful moment to get yourself in shape. You should tackle bad habits and consider whatever changes in exercise and diet are necessary to tone up. Oh, and keep a loved one informed about your latest plans. 
GEMINI, You have made all the right moves recently, and by all accounts you are continuing to do so. You may therefore allow yourself a brief pat on the back! At work realise that your own interests can only be achieved if you depart from the straight and narrow. CANCER Please don't jump to hasty conclusions - and do make sure that you have all the relevant facts at your fingertips. If you base your actions on conjecture or rumour you will go badly off course. Rest assured that colleagues are willing to be persuaded. 
LEO, The accent is now on travel, and you are probably aware of the need to broaden your horizons. A handsome selection of planets suggests that whether you're old, young or in-between, now is the time to take your education into new fields. It's never too late to learn! 
VIRGO, Much depends on your success in attracting extra funds, for that is the only way you'll be able to afford your domestic and family plans. It's quite a hopeful moment, but don't mistake slow progress for no progress. Voluntary work adds to your quality of life, so get out there and do your bit for others. 
LIBRA, You're treading an emotional tight-rope, unsure of which way to jump. Problems will only arise if you are so sensitive that you lose your self-confidence. It would be a shame if you also lost touch with your objectives, yet be assured that you'll be back on course before long. 
SCORPIO, You may be looking for an escape route, but in reality you probably don't need one. It may be sufficient just to duck out of an engagement or two, and give yourself enough time to decide whether you want in or out. No doubt impatient people will put pressure on you, but you'll do your best to resist. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is one of those moments when emotional intimacy can flower, apparently out of nowhere. It is therefore a perfect period for making new friendships and deepening old ones, and of course for relishing rare romantic encounters. Plus, an old friend might walk back into your life. 
CAPRICORN, For some time now you have suspected that if other people aren't actually undermining you, they're not giving you the support you deserve. This may be because you over-estimated what could actually be achieved. It might also be up to you to set a better example! 
AQUARIUS, Your two main tasks should be to sort out your finances first, and then sit down and talk to people about your plans, securing their agreement if you can. All should be done within an overall ethical framework, the value of which will be to provide you with personal guidelines. 
TAURUS, 'Keep busy and stay active' should be your motto over the next two days. The Moon's angle to your sign is one of those which may not bring drama, but can push you step by step to a new and much more successful state of being. You might even hear something that makes you sit up and take notice of an old friend! 
GEMINI, You may go through the day with a spring in your step, young at heart and confident that it is indeed possible to shrug off most cares and woes. It might be difficult to alter the attitudes of a lifetime, but you really should give it your best shot. CANCER It's time to consider exactly what to do about putting a deep-seated ambition into practice. There's no need for action just yet, but it will do you good to sort your ideas out and check the facts. And then you need to reassure a loved one who is feeling especially insecure. 
LEO, It's decision time, but the choices you'll make will probably be quite unimportant. You can therefore afford to take it easy, just as long, that is, as your communication skills are functioning on top form. What I mean is, you need to keep family members informed of your movements. 
VIRGO, You should pay very careful attention to the financial situation. On a purely mundane level it's a fine day for picking up bargains, but what could be more significant is what other people decide about your monetary future - and that may be out of your hands. 
LIBRA, The Moon is now aligned with your sign, so you can finally afford to dictate the pace. Your actions will be determined by your rapidly changing moods, so other people may be bewildered or perplexed when you alter your ideas. Perhaps they should be more flexible! 
SCORPIO, You have learned a lot more about self-preservation lately, probably due to Saturn's slow transit through your chart. A momentary lack of confidence will be overcome with renewed effort and determination. And if you do face insurmountable obstacles, it might be time to pause for breath. 
SAGITTARIUS, You will finally convince other people that you do need their help and support. At work you may concentrate on the long-term picture, and don't let trivial details obscure your vision. And you should get on with practical improvements at home - after a momentary lapse. 
CAPRICORN, Your main bone of contention relates to career or professional interests, but with the Moon so active you can probably make a success out of playing the diplomat. Realise that it is less important to push your own interests than to get other people to agree. 
AQUARIUS, Long-distance developments seem to be the most important, and it's a suitable moment to get in touch with family members overseas. The legal situation may also need some attention, so check up on your rights. But that also means you have to be aware of your responsibilities. 
TAURUS, Decide whether one particular friendship or emotional connection is worth maintaining on its present level. Otherwise think about what you can do to make your life more enjoyable and creative. After all, you were put on this planet to relish life's pleasures. 
GEMINI, You could not ask for more support from home, even though family members may not be much use unless you demonstrate to all and sundry that you have a firm direction and that you know exactly what you are doing. You must assert your authority first, and then exercise it with wisdom. CANCER Deeply favourable aspects relate to travel stars and connections with people in other places. Quite simply it is an excellent moment to pick up your pen, get on the phone and get in touch. You might even be surprised by some of the hidden truths which come to light. 
LEO, There's still a strong emphasis on cost, and you may be inhibited by the feeling that there's something you want, but can't afford. There may be a way around almost any obstacle, but you must persuade others that you need their unqualified backing. 
VIRGO, You have the advantage, and a number of emotional trump cards are still in your hand. Do be aware though, that as money becomes a more important consideration, so you may shift your position over a number of relationships. Give partners time to catch up. 
LIBRA, Give your mystical and spiritual aspirations a bit of extra space today. There is a great deal to be said for spending some time by yourself, and also in thinking deeply about what exactly it is that makes partners tick. The answers might be surprising. 
SCORPIO, There is far too much at stake for you to lose control now. Venus's occupation of your chart makes it clear that at work your best chances come from improving relationships with colleagues. In fact, business and pleasure may merge in an intriguing manner. 
SAGITTARIUS, Even people you have dealt with in the past could turn out to be unreliable, but by the same token, people you thought untrustworthy will eventually prove their true worth. Don't judge others by appearances! You might even have been wrong in your assessment of a close friend. 
CAPRICORN, Solving those daily problems is all a matter of common sense! Check out legal questions and, in all areas, consider the ethical issues. Establish a sense of moral purpose, free from dogma, and you'll manage your practical affairs very much more efficiently in future. 
AQUARIUS, You are very likely to find that aspects of your personal life have changed out of all recognition. You're now entering a period of consolidation which could continue until the next bout of change in about two or three months' time. Prepare your ground with all due care. 
TAURUS, Make sure you have an enjoyable day. The Moon's position suggests that what oriental sages have been saying for centuries is true: even routine and humdrum activities can be satisfying if accomplished with the right attitude. Go on - try it! 
GEMINI, Domestic and family responsibilities are likely to be most pressing today. Even if you're at work, the best way to complete all your responsibilities will be to generate a family atmosphere. If everyone knows their place, they'll do the best job. CANCER Good communication seems to be awfully important, and you'll have to realise that if you don't attend to all practical complexities yourself, others are likely to step in - and get it all wrong. Take the responsibility for putting your own plans into action. 
LEO, Current discussions over finances are likely to be linked to past emotional dramas, in which case it may be difficult to see the way forward. Don't act free and easy with other people's cash, by the way, because they're bound to notice sooner or later! 
VIRGO, The Moon is happily ensconced in a friendly region of your chart today, so you should be able to take life as you find it. You'll be slightly more emotional than usual, and this means that you may be more compassionate to others; suffering, but also more likely to take offence. 
LIBRA, Keep yourself to yourself if that is what you want. You may have to put on a performance in public, but what is truly important is what's happening in your sub-conscious. The decisions you make now will shape your affairs over the next four weeks. 
SCORPIO, Powerful social planets suggest that now is the time for team-work and co-operation. Don't try to go it alone for, if you do, you'll run the risk of shooting yourself in the foot. Make the most of children's enthusiasm, and do what you can to shape their energies positively. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's time to be ambitious, and not to be ashamed about it! It's no over-statement to say that even apparently trivial developments over the coming days and weeks could change your career direction for good, so there's no room at all for complacency. 
CAPRICORN, If you still feel confused, hurt or angry its because recent traumas are still being stirred up by other people. However, over the next few weeks you will gradually understand that what has happened has been for the best. It's just that it might not have been what you were expecting. 
AQUARIUS, You may try to distance yourself from any colleagues who make you feel upset or angry, and concentrate on important things like boosting your income, and setting yourself up for future prosperity. Its time to look after number one - and, when you've taken care of yourself, you can think about others. 
TAURUS, Family members and people at home are in an impatient mood, and there'll be moments when you're forced into a corner. People at work may have rejected your advice. Don't worry, though, as before the week is out colleagues should have realised the error of their ways. 
GEMINI, The week is full of promise, even though there may be many crises to deal with. In fact, it's your business affairs which are coming under scrutiny. The brightest days of the week for resolving all legal issues and arranging long-distance travel are Wednesday and Thursday. CANCER The Moon begins the week by challenging your sign, so you may be pre-occupied by partnership matters, in particular by the need to persuade a friend or colleague to agree with your plans. As it happens, this is an excellent week to get proposals for domestic change back on course. 
LEO, The Sun is busy shedding light on ideas and agreements which have been neglected for some time. After Mercury makes some significant alignments in the middle of the week, you'll have all the opportunity you've been waiting for to arrange appointments, seek interviews and hold important discussions. 
VIRGO, Although business deals and expenditure plans have been subject to various delays in recent weeks, Mercury, the planet responsible for placing hurdles in your path is about to form another series of alignments. You should be prepared for a flood of communications around the end of the week. 
LIBRA, Financial and property matters loom large, so it's time to get your affairs in order. There have been unavoidable delays recently, and you're not totally to blame for the slow pace of developments. However, friends and loved ones are waiting for you to takedecisive action. 
SCORPIO, Often it works well if you keep certain information to yourself, though family members may be challenging your secretive tendencies, inspiring you to come clean. But, are you really ready to reveal all? It may be best to keep friends and partners fully informed of your plans and activities. 
SAGITTARIUS, The week's top planets are Mars and Uranus, a combination which is bound to make you think afresh about your independence - and about what you need to do to recover your freedom. What is taking place at the moment involves all that is most profound and fundamental to your existence. 
CAPRICORN, You may be feeling a little more emotional than usual, but this is natural now that Neptune is making its presence felt in fresh regions of your chart. However, don't get too carried away, otherwise you'll miss out on very exciting professional developments. 
AQUARIUS, Life is always complicated, never easy! There'll be a great deal going on behind the scenes at the beginning of the week, but don't fall into the trap of imagining that other people are out to get you. You should ignore rumours and discount superstitions unless you have hard concrete evidence that they're true. 
TAURUS, You have long ago realised that there are situations in which the best plan is to stay still and avoid being noticed. This may be your most effective strategy unless, that is, you are prepared to turn your life upside down! It all depends on how much confidence you have - and courage! 
GEMINI, You have no doubt discovered what other people have been up to, but don't imagine that you know the whole truth. This is a very useful time for travel, partly because the results will exceed your expectations. It's possible that an unexpected encounter could take your life in a new direction. CANCER Think about what you can do for others. Within the family it seems to be children and younger relatives who need maximum unconditional support. Your behaviour may be largely dominated by events which took place a long time ago, and memories which may be buried deep in your unconscious. 
LEO, You are probably unaware of just how much you can influence other people, and it's therefore very important indeed to be positive - to encourage, cajole and enthuse them, creating a sense of hope. This is in spite of the fact that you may be a little wobbly emotionally. 
VIRGO, You may well have hidden fears and suspicions, perhaps because you imagine that an agreement is coming unstuck. Careful and practical action is the answer. Also, raise your spirits with pleasant day-dreams, and spend a little time planning those much-needed improvements. 
LIBRA, Seen from one angle your stars are positively riotous, although social costs may spiral out of control unless you take firm action. Old friends may be on your mind, so get in touch. Steer clear of conflict; even if that does mean postponing a particular appointment. 
SCORPIO, Your stars have seldom looked more competitive. Put aside any doubts, overcome all qualms, and set out to be number one in love, at home and at work. Only accept those social taboos and constraints which suit you. And don't let everyone else know your intentions - unless you absolutely have to. 
SAGITTARIUS, Life is in the balance and could swing either way, whether towards confrontation or towards great joy. The choice is yours. The main consideration, though, is always to aim for the most adventurous options, broadening your horizons and catching a glimpse of the larger picture. 
CAPRICORN, You seem to be going through an extravagant phase and, in some cases, that may be an understatement! Domestic and family commitments could add to the monetary burden, while personal relationships are heading for an intense period. The next few weeks could bring surprises, so get ready. 
AQUARIUS, Matrimonial and partnership affairs become even more important - if such a thing were possible. It is necessary to put your own interests to one side ever so briefly, offering your full emotional support to people you love. I hope they'll appreciate your sacrifice. 
TAURUS, The prospect of a move of home or some other major domestic upheaval must now look more attractive. At the very least you should bring as much colour into your home and family life as you possibly can. That's no more than you deserve. Plus, what's good for you could be right for everyone. 
GEMINI, It's decision time. Or is it? The fact is that while you may be pushed into making a choice, probably an emotional one, it looks very certain that whatever is agreed now will be altered again next month. Mind you, you will very soon make unexpected gains in a personal area. That's the good news! CANCER This is certainly a rare moment of passion. If all is calm on the surface, beware, for underneath you're like a seething volcano waiting to erupt. It seems that your emotional security is at stake. You just need to feel that you're appreciated. That's all! 
LEO, There's a real planetary traffic jam in your sign today, with planets shuffling here, there and everywhere. You may permit yourself a spell of confusion, and by all means wallow in your emotions. If there are important matters to deal with, call the experts! 
VIRGO, One positive way to use your current planetary energy is to dip into mystical and spiritual realities, searching for the pattern underlying your day-to-day affairs. Some sort of selfless involvement in a charity or other noble enterprise is now increasingly likely. 
LIBRA, Everything hinges around what friends feel, say and do. The fact is, though, that they may be saying one thing and doing something else! One way or the other, your social stars are looking more intense than at any time since last year. If there's any chance that you can help soothe a loved one's nerves, please do so! 
SCORPIO, The professional dimension in your horoscope is looking so strong that, if you're unhappy at work, the pressure to change jobs in mid-stream may be irresistible. It's also now time to seek status in your community. Perhaps you'll be turning the clock back, completing a task that you began a long time ago. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is one of those rare moments when you all too easily get stuck in some sort of dogma about the way people should behave. If you get too upset about rules and arbitrary expectations, you'll miss out on the richness of day-to-day human experience. You'll also sacrifice a passing opportunity. 
CAPRICORN, There does now seem to be some sort of turning point in your financial affairs, perhaps one which will colour your prosperity for the years to come. Don't be afraid to turn the clock back for, if you lay the past to rest, you will be much better at dealing with the present. 
AQUARIUS, You really must listen to other people today, and even bend over backwards to see their points of view. This may go against the grain, but is a good strategy because you need to let partners get things off their chest. You'll be able to take the lead again as soon as the air is cleared. 
TAURUS, If you don't make a point of being optimistic today, nobody else will. Given that this is one of those days when partners and relatives may be giving vent to negative feelings, it's up to you to show them something more positive. Go on - do your best! 
GEMINI, Mars is the planet to watch, especially as it's an indication of an impending burst of celestial energy. Do yourself a very big favour now and get on with practical tasks rather than being seduced into emotional cul-de-sacs by people who should know better. CANCER You have a fair degree of control over most of what happens today so, if you wish, you can remain above the fray. Besides, you've had your share of anguish in the past. Keep an exceptionally close eye on your finances, by the way, or someone will be tempted to take advantage. 
LEO, Your stars really are quite extraordinarily powerful, but you should realise that your emotional strength needs to be exercised with care and restraint. Follow a hunch by all means, but don't jump to conclusions. And don't be too hard on partners who don't come up to scratch. 
VIRGO, Something secret seems to be bugging you today. It may be an event that happened a long time ago, perhaps which may concern an old love. If you feel the urge to get in touch and renew an old contact, or revisit past haunts, go ahead. You deserve a break. 
LIBRA, Your professional stars are strong, but not so strong that success is inevitable. You'll have to do your share of bowing and scraping! Socially, partners will be eating out of your hand, but you will have to be quite exceptionally wise and mature in your responses. 
SCORPIO, You should tread very carefully at work and understand that the so-called facts are quite irrelevant. What is very much more important is what people, especially employers, believe to be the case. Give authority figures a wide berth - especially if they're unlikely to see reason! 
SAGITTARIUS, There could be doubts over an ethical or moral matter, and it's the spirit, rather than the letter, of the law, which should be most important. Changes in travel plans could be caused by gradually evolving romantic hopes, and you can only gain from going on a charm offensive. 
CAPRICORN, Social costs could be high, and you can, if you wish, duck out of one particular commitment. Also, something that was lost, perhaps long ago, maybe a prized possession, possibly a relationship, may soon be recovered. There'll be time enough for celebration later. 
AQUARIUS, You may be holding the thin line of decent and responsible behaviour against people who can see nothing beyond the gratification of their immediate feelings. You may compromise over details, but not principles. What's more, you may set a fine example to others. 
TAURUS, Restlessness rises, and you could even be tempted to move home. One way or another there seems to be a great need to improve your domestic existence, perhaps to introduce a splash of colour. At work, any personal friction can be overcome with a willingness to say ‘sorry'. 
GEMINI, The Moon is now bound to trigger some of the livelier aspects of your personality. If you were to spend the whole day chattering away and generally expressing your latest opinions, this would be perfect. Mind you, you'd probably be wise to keep at least half an eye on practical responsibilities! CANCER You really do have a chance to make a fresh start in financial affairs. On one level it's a good day for picking up bargains, but look around and you'll discover ways in which you can boost your long-term prosperity. Perhaps a social liaison offers the security you're looking for. 
LEO, The Moon plays a curious role in your chart, suggesting a simultaneous rise in confidence and increase in sensitivity. This is an ideal time to launch yourself into a brave new existence, although there is no pressing need to act today. Any ventures initiated over the next three days will be very important. 
VIRGO, Secrecy comes naturally to you. This is not because you wish to deceive anybody, just your belief that certain things are private and not for other people's eyes or ears. You're in an imaginative mood and mystical truths make more sense to you than the so-called facts. 
LIBRA, Socially, your life is looking up. Although there have doubtless been some disappointments, you have to see that what is truly necessary now is a willingness to voluntarily let go of certain emotional ties. You never know - loved ones might like the new you. 
SCORPIO, Professionally you are still on to a winner. In all areas there seems to be a great deal to gain from seeking out fresh responsibilities and pursuing new ambitions. If there should be any setbacks then, strange to say, the way is being opened for even greater success. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sometimes it's not what people do that's important, but what they think. In other words, philosophical considerations should be taken seriously. You may think they're irrelevant, but you should realise that what you believe shapes your actions and controls your future. Oh, and welcome any new long-distance contacts. 
CAPRICORN, Business prospects have seldom been stronger, even if there's some information which cannot be trusted, not to mention people who are unreliable. There is much to gain from launching into some new venture as long as you keep your options wide open. Domestic improvements could be high on the agenda, with bargains to be had. 
AQUARIUS, This could be a remarkable time for personal relationships, with the chance of a highly significant meeting rising by the hour. Indeed, your life could be changed by the people who are soon to walk into it. Could that be a good thing? Well, yes, if you handle it right. 
TAURUS, Good communication is absolutely essential if you are to make a success of both personal and professional plans today. It's a fantastic day for anyone attending interviews or making important proposals, just as long as you are prepared for the unexpected! 
GEMINI, You may pay more attention to financial affairs, but should be aware that money has certain psychological and symbolic connections. It may well be that if you should be tempted to go on a spending spree, it's because something is not going so well in the rest of your life. CANCER The Moon is in an extremely strong position today, and that's good for you. However, it has to be said that there's a chance of confusion, muddle and mistakes, even though it may be tempered by bursts of supreme romantic inspiration. Just steer clear of awkward commitments, or any initiatives which could back-fire. 
LEO, It could do you a power of good to keep yourself to yourself for a couple of days. If other people are trying to force you into a premature decision, feel free to delay and prevaricate for as long as you can. If you do make snap decisions, you could be letting other people in for trouble a little way down the line, so take sensible precautions. 
VIRGO, If you're taking time off for lunch, you're making the right move. It just so happens that the most unpredictable planetary alignments of the day urge you to pamper yourself, if only to avoid the perils of tension and stress. You should also leave yourself open to unexpected developments. 
LIBRA, It will pay to take work seriously, but it could be love, or social engagements, which are most on your mind. Although there may have to be some changes, this definitely seems to be a good period for a reunion. Rather than sitting around waiting for the phone to ring, you can take the lead and get in touch. 
SCORPIO, You may consider reviving professional plans which have been ignored or left on the back burner. In fact, this is about the best thing you can do at the moment. If you're not currently at work, you should find any way you can to gain respect in the community. 
SAGITTARIUS, Financial plans should proceed satisfactorily, although domestic costs could increase before long. If there is to be an extravagant outburst, then you'll need to take care and keep an eye on changing prices. Actually, though, emotional risks are as likely as monetary ones! 
CAPRICORN, You'll have to listen to partners very intently indeed, even though they may sometimes say completely the opposite from what they mean! Don't feel bound to commitments which have outlived their purpose. There is little to be gained by hanging on to the past at the expense of the present. 
AQUARIUS, It should be business as normal today - or so you might imagine. There is a much greater than average chance that you will be forced to consider completely new factors, especially at work. But, as soon as you think you've found the answer, the questions change! 
TAURUS, The important task now is to talk about your feelings. Nothing else will do. It may also be necessary to take a few short journeys, probably in pursuit of outstanding family business. It could be a relief to resolve a lingering problem. Your social stars look bright by the way, so don't be shy. 
GEMINI, You really must make an early start if you want to get the most out of the day. You should realise, however, that the determining factor will be the amount of money you have in your pocket, not to mention the cost of those items which are necessary to your plans. CANCER You may be slightly unsure of yourself, but that's understandable. This is probably no bad thing, for a little self-doubt will encourage you to question your preconceptions and hence to do a great deal better next time around. There's room for improvement, as you know! 
LEO, You may be inclined to spend more time by yourself, away from troublesome human company. Whether this is possible or not is another matter. After all, you can't just abandon all your commitments with the wave of a hand. And, if someone entrusts you with a secret, you must respect their confidence. 
VIRGO, Your social stars are strong - and you'll do well if you link up with like-minded people. That way, even the most controversial ideas could succeed. At work, you will do best if you take the long-range point of view and avoid being bogged down in short-term details. 
LIBRA, The professional picture looks fairly positive, and you may be required to take on new responsibilities - and accept authority over other people. In all matters you should be prepared to play a maternal and compassionate role, even with complete strangers! 
SCORPIO, You have to do the right thing. Lingering legal questions should be answered as soon as possible, and moral issues should be faced head-on. Also, take the chance to get in touch with family members overseas, especially people you haven't seen for some time. 
SAGITTARIUS, Business and financial plans require more attention, especially if you've taken a risk or got involved in a possibly awkward joint enterprise. Take an inventive approach and realise that old solutions may no longer be the best. And that goes for romantic affairs as well. 
CAPRICORN, You will have to listen to other people - and take their very good advice. More important, though, is the necessity of understanding their feelings and making a much greater effort to sympathise with their point of view. A generous spirit should win the day. 
AQUARIUS, Work must take the first priority today, even if social concerns constitute the major long-term question. You should recognise that there may be no decision concerning one important emotional tie for a little while longer. Please be patient. 
TAURUS, There'll be a great deal going on behind the scenes, much of it to your credit. It would be misleading to pretend that everything will be easy, because much of what happens will be unfamiliar and will require you to make quick responses. Yet you'll show yourself at your best. 
GEMINI, Life has improved considerably recently, although much that happens from now on will depend on what use you have made of the often remarkable opportunities that have come your way. Actually, a new relationship or job might now be subject to delays which will lead you to think you've been the victim of a false start. Cancer This is certainly a dynamic moment - in theory, at least! Although there's a part of you that is happy to drift along as if everything was fine, you're much too ambitious to let life remain the same for long. The planets will give you little choice but to set about improving your lot. 
LEO, This should be one of those quiet times when you have the chance to catch up with chores you began some time ago and never finished, and when you have the time to consolidate all that you have achieved in the past year. However, as the week passes, domestic questions will begin to occupy more and more of your time. 
VIRGO, You are now moving decisively into a highly creative phase of your life. This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll suddenly discover your artistic talent, although this may happen. What is does mean is that you'll be taking a much more imaginative and individual approach to your life than was often the case in the past. 
LIBRA, Hopefully you are spending much of your time preparing for future activities. This is, after all, a special period. Your romantic life will be dominated by stealth and secrecy, partly because this gives an added flavour of danger and mystery. 
SCORPIO, Venus is pleasantly aligned with your sign at the moment, a factor which is responsible for bringing peace and harmony to your relationships. If the path of love is smooth at the moment, enjoy it. But, don't be complacent, for you might misunderstand a partner's intentions and end up disappointed. 
SAGITTARIUS, Saturn, the planet of restriction and limitation, is easing the pressure on your financial affairs. You're therefore quite entitled to breathe a final sigh of relief, secure in the knowledge that you can now revert to your true dynamic character without fear of being caught out by some minor obstacle. 
CAPRICORN, Jupiter the most benign planet, is helping you through, and Mars, ruler of vitality and energy, leaves you in a much more relaxed frame of mind than you have been for quite a few weeks. This planet always brings mixed blessings. Ah well, you can't have it all. 
AQUARIUS, This looks like a lively month on the emotional front, mainly because you're impatient for instant results. Plus, any long-distance or foreign contacts you have built up over the last year will continue to play an influential role in your life. 
TAURUS, Your best bet at the moment is to distance yourself from all those individuals who cannot face up to harsh realities, and to stick with people who are prepared to tackle life head-on. Also, you should recognise that in some senses your situation is easier than relations' - and that they might be waiting for you to step in. 
GEMINI, The chances are that before very much longer you will be called upon to take control of a personal situation. Just how this affects your relationships with people you live with is at present far from clear, but it's possible that they might begin to respect you much more in the future. CANCER It's time for a fundamental change of approach. As long as you realise that you cannot have it all your own way there will be no problem. Only if you naively imagine that others exist to do your bidding will you run into the inevitable disappointment. 
LEO, You have come up against your fair share of brick walls, and may feel entitled to ask just when other people are going to give up their opposition to your plans. The answer is not yet. The secret is to realise that their criticism is both very necessary and very helpful. 
VIRGO, If you quietly walk away from conflicts or disagreements, nobody will ever know exactly what your desires and hopes are. You must find the middle way between allowing yourself to be walked all over and getting involved in a futile battle. The answer might not be obvious at first, but you'll soon figure it out. 
LIBRA, Although you may believe that you are being kind, considerate and caring, you might, in fact, be looking after your own interests in the best way you know - by avoiding criticism. This strategy may come unstuck quite soon, so stay alert to changing emotional undercurrents. 
SCORPIO, Partners' help will now prove invaluable. This goes for both intensely personal issues and long-term professional arrangements. Missing information will soon resurface, which should please you no end. Hopefully, you'll be happy with what you hear! 
SAGITTARIUS, There are bound to be moments when you have to bite your lip and say nothing. It could be said that you know too much for your own good, but you'll soon find a way to deal with a current dilemma. If all works out for the best, then a partner might let you off the hook without your having to do anything. 
CAPRICORN, You're formulating plans for the next few months, but if you are thinking of making a break in an established tie or relationship, think again. It may be that any move now would be premature, and that you would do best to wait for another two or three weeks. 
AQUARIUS, You have been devoting a fair amount of attention to developing certain long-term projects, and this is at it should be. The question now is whether the people you have in mind are the right ones, especially when it comes to your most intimate hopes. 
TAURUS, Your best bet at the moment is to distance yourself from all those individuals who cannot face up to harsh realities, and to stick with people who are prepared to tackle life head-on. Also, you should recognise that in some senses your situation is easier than relations, and that they might be waiting for you to step in. 
GEMINI, The chances are that before very much longer you will be called upon to take control of a personal situation. Just how this affects your relationships with people you live with is at present far from clear, but it's possible that they might begin to respect you much more in the future. CANCER It's time for a fundamental change of approach. As long as you realise that you cannot have it all your own way there will be no problem. Only if you naively imagine that others exist to do your bidding will you run into the inevitable disappointment.

SCORPIO, Partners' help will now prove invaluable. This goes for both intensely personal issues and long-term professional arrangements. Missing information will soon resurface, which should please you no end. Hopefully, you will be happy with what you hear! 
SAGITTARIUS, There are bound to be moments when you have to bite your lip and say nothing. It could be said that you know too much for your own good, but you will soon find a way to deal with a current dilemma. If all works out for the best, then a partner might let you off the hook without your having to do anything. 
CAPRICORN, You are formulating plans for the next few months, but if you are thinking of making a break in an established tie or relationship, think again. It may be that any move now would be premature, and that you would do best to wait for another two or three weeks. 
AQUARIUS, You have been devoting a fair amount of attention to developing certain long- term projects, and this is at it should be. The question now is whether the people you have in mind are the right ones, especially when it comes to your most intimate hopes. 
TAURUS, Venus, your planetary ruler, is now entering a relationship with Pluto, which is sure to raise your hopes and inflate your desires. The best advice is to work hard, check legal complications and exploit all overseas or long-distance contacts. 
GEMINI, You seem to be in a state of uncertainty. If so, this is a thoroughly good thing, because it means you're aware that change is in the air. It also reveals that there is more to come to light before you can take a firm decision. You must be patient! CANCER A little caution now will help you achieve far greater things in the future. Don't be dismayed by delays at work, for someone who has dropped out of the picture will shortly reappear. Incidentally, it's about time that other people pulled their weight at home! 
LEO, Your plans will fall into place once Mercury, planet of communication, begins to influence the region of your chart connected to home and family. You're about to realise something about someone close which should both surprise and reassure you. 
VIRGO, You may well be feeling misguided and out of your depth, but you're not alone. The only difference is that you have the humility to realise it. That's by far the best basis from which to get on with the next stage of your personal ambitions. 
LIBRA, The best possible planetary aspects suggest that, if you want to convert rivals into allies and turn allies into close friends, there is nothing to stop you. Yet the problem with this period is your tendency to go over the top: you seem unable to restrain your emotional expectations. 
SCORPIO, Discretion is the better part of valour, as they say. The advantage you now have over others is that you can choose when to stay silent and when to say your piece. Wait a few more weeks by all means. And if you want to keep your feelings secret, that's your right. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should see to it that all debts are paid in full, including emotional ones. Other people should be in no doubt that their relations with you are subject to duties as well as rights. You might owe them a favour, but they might owe you much more. 
CAPRICORN, Venus, lady of love, is now striking the right chord. You'll have to play a careful game for even while you allow your emotional hopes to be raised, you must keep your feet firmly on the ground. You have everything to play for at the moment, and little to lose! 
AQUARIUS, Although the romantic situation is dominated by secrecy, everything else in your life now indicates that the time has come to enter into new agreements and generally broaden your horizons. But before you can tell other people how you feel, you have to be comfortable with your own desires. 
TAURUS, With any luck you should be able to take life at a relatively easy pace. The last thing you want to do now is accept more responsibility than you can handle, especially if you're already behind. It's an intense moment in many respects, but extra goodwill should be more than enough to see you through. 
GEMINI, You may allow family, domestic and property matters to take their own course. This doesn't mean that you should abdicate all responsibility, but that you may allow certain developments to become much clearer before you step in and intervene.   Cancer If you really enjoy confrontations or relish pitting your wits against others, you are in a strong position indeed. However, if you imagine that you will have the last laugh, think again. There might be many other changes of circumstance before you can make a final decision. 
LEO, The opposition to your plans both at home and at work is dissolving. Your suspicions should have been satisfied, if not entirely laid to rest, and you may have very much more confidence about the next step in a personal affair. The question is — will a partner play along with you? 
VIRGO, It's your turn to benefit from lunar alignments. You may well be more sensitive than usual, and hence easily offended, but also more compassionate and sympathetic to others' weaknesses. If you can make a go of a shaky enterprise, then you will win welcome praise — and eventually rewards as well. 
LIBRA, It's a relatively secretive moment. This is not to say that you have thoughts or feelings which must be kept from the light of day, but that you may be more comfortable if others are not given the opportunity to question you. Mind you, they might just have some good advice, if only you'd listen. 
SCORPIO, Personally, professionally and financially many of your emotional storm-clouds have now started to disperse. However, there will be further pressure for change at home next year, so don't be complacent. As you have realised, there is always room for improvement. 
SAGITTARIUS, You can be among the most persuasive of people, but you'd better watch what you say just now. The simple reason is that you are about to change your mind again, so the last thing you want is other people hanging on your every word. You'd rather they made their own minds up. 
CAPRICORN, The time is fast approaching when you will have to lay your feelings on the line. For your own emotional safety, you should be very wary about making fresh commitments, at least those which are permanently binding. Perhaps you need to leave yourself an escape route. 
AQUARIUS, No amount of pressure or persuasion should push you into making social or professional changes until you're ready. New information could be revealed next week, and it might radically alter your perceptions, so hang on in there. Wait until the air clears before coming to firm conclusions. 
TAURUS, One thing that Jupiter is teaching you is that you should expect more of yourself at work and in the fulfilment of your worldly ambitions. Don't expect everything to be easy in any routine or practical task, but set out to stretch yourself and acquire new skills. 
GEMINI, If you are obsessed by the past you deserve a big pat on the back, for it shows that you are very much in tune with your stars. The point is that unfinished business, including any in relationships, needs to be tied up before you can face the future. Read | Talks still on, our 303-seat mandate for change, to push reforms: Narendra Singh Tomar CANCER You may be discovering that money makes the world go round. A simple truth, but a profound one nonetheless. The fact is that if you wish to put certain of your dreams into action, you will have to pay your way. You may also have to pay for somebody else's! 
LEO, If you still wish to air your opinions and grievances this is a relatively safe moment to do so. Certain planetary pressures are pretty slight, so the risk of others over-reacting is slim. Mind you, you can't take anything - or anyone - for granted. 
VIRGO, Over the next few days, you will be presented with many opportunities to improve relationships with children and younger family members. Be sure to seize them when they come along, otherwise you'll end up in a real scrape. A kind word now will stave off all sorts of trouble later on.

LIBRA, All those people who once believed that you were far too insecure to change direction will soon be proved very wrong. From now, and over the next ten weeks, your most important quality will be belief in yourself. You might even inspire others' faith in your talents. 
SCORPIO, If you are cursing yourself for having taken the wrong decision, do not give up hope. Very soon, perhaps even next week, everything will be up for grabs again, and you'll have a chance to change your mind. Be sure that you don't let someone down, though. Read | ‘Love jihad' law's victim: I fear my baby is dead…I want my husband back 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything that you experienced or discovered in recent weeks is now being put back under the microscope. If you wish to break any arrangements you may do so now, but do take others' feelings into account. You will doubtless also respect a confidence - and should hang on to a secret. 
CAPRICORN, You still need to learn how to put your assets to better use and not let emotions cloud your vision. That said, Venus' sensitive presence in your chart means that you can never be entirely free of your feelings. In fact, you might be about to experience a wave of nostalgia. 
AQUARIUS, You will soon be able to relax your efforts and appreciate all the good things of life. Although you may have to face awkward questions for a second time, you should do so with confidence in your own position. There is nothing to be gained from ignoring essential facts. 
TAURUS, You now have a chance to prove just how astute, sympathetic and self-protective you can be, although nobody should doubt just what you have had to go through to reach your current state of self-knowledge! Only your closest friends really understand how you feel. 
GEMINI, Reassuring planetary aspects signify that you may procrastinate to your heart's desire. In fact, there is nothing like putting things off until tomorrow to restore your belief that you are in control of your own life. Mind you, you can't put the inevitable off forever!   CANCER The financial outlook is becoming brighter. The one thing you can be sure of is that planets aligned with your solar house of money are doing their best. Your long-term security is therefore not at issue, but if you're tempted to take a risk you might want to leave it for a few days. 
LEO, You should, by rights, fare better than most these days, for you are under a sort of infallible celestial protection. The important planetary aspects are setting up a pattern extending over two or three years, so their effects will not at first be obvious. 
VIRGO, Sometimes you have to stand up, be counted and be true to your beliefs! Don't become complacent or imagine that others will step in to save the day. Only if you rely on your own skills and talents can you be sure that you will win through and achieve your goals. 
LIBRA, At times like these, when planetary pressures are few, you should begin to notice Jupiter's benevolent movements in your emotional life. Remember, though, that 'good luck' often has strange results. Today's blessings might bring tomorrow's problems, so leave nothing to chance. 
SCORPIO, You may have had to endure some sort of a break or separation. Don't blame other people, and don't blame yourself, either! Rather, try to see what underlying purpose may have been served. Even an unexpected rejection could pave the way for something much better. 
SAGITTARIUS, Although you still need to choose your words with care, you should insist on telling the truth as you see it. The crux of the matter is not what you say, but who you say it to: some people understand you, others do not. You might have to learn the difficult art of patience! 
CAPRICORN, You must not be drawn into any further unnecessary arguments, especially if you have no personal emotional interest in the people with whom you disagree. It would be better to enjoy the little pleasures that are now coming your way, and leave thoughtless individuals to fend for themselves. 
AQUARIUS, At work it is all a question of least said, soonest mended. One thing you can rely on is that employers or colleagues will eventually return to the same question, like some sort of broken record. Why don't you try and lead everyone into the future? 
TAURUS, You may be enthusiastic about imminent domestic changes, but partners might be completely bemused as to your real intentions. At the heart of the matter, lies your need for emotional commitment, and your willingness to come up with the goods and fulfill promises you have made in the past. 
GEMINI, Personal events over the next few days could give you a completely different slant on a private issue. Your perspective will be challenged by partners whose behaviour is defying all expectations. Mind you, perhaps it's about time that your preconceptions were challenged!   CANCER You don't need to interpret others' unreliability as a sign that you're being let down. After all, they might not even be thinking about you! You should try to see the larger pattern and you'll realise that changes in your plans will open up welcome, fresh opportunities. 
LEO, The Moon's presence in your chart induces a compassionate note, and others may be struck by the depths of your emotions. All that is required of you is the determination and confidence to show your feelings in public. That shouldn't be too much of a problem! 
VIRGO, You're passing through one of your perfectionist phases. You may set yourself new, higher standards and goals and, in typical fashion, attempt to beat your own personal best. If you wish, you may turn your attention to private matters which have been left on the shelf for far too long. Delay no longer! READ | Bhupesh Baghel: No uniformity in mandis, then how can you have one Act? 
LIBRA, Although it is in your nature to give others a considerable amount of leeway - too much some would say - you may soon be about to draw the line. Professional colleagues and employers should realise that they cannot get off scot-free, but that they have to fulfill their commitments. 
SCORPIO, There's a little celestial tension, although not too much!  There are bound to be a lot of bruised egos around, but other people are not your responsibility. If you allow them to blame you, or become dependent on you, you will do neither them nor yourself any favours. 
SAGITTARIUS, You might have to take a step back, but there is no need to sacrifice your beliefs or principles, although you should accept some restraints. It's all a matter of where to draw the line. The question is whether you can abandon an arrangement without letting someone down. READ | As cases drop, experts say spread may be more than what is known 
CAPRICORN, If you haven't managed to force others to honour their financial obligations, it may be too late. However, within a few days, a welcome window of opportunity may appear via a social connection. It might, in fact, be a rival who comes up with the best advice. 
AQUARIUS, Sometimes wishes really can come true. If you continue to believe that this is a period of truly unique opportunities for advancement in both personal and professional affairs, you will, in some strange way, attract certain very benevolent offers. 
TAURUS, It's time for all you Taureans to exercise due caution, so think long and hard before committing yourself to any financial ventures. Impulse buys should be off the agenda unless you are willing to part with a large amount of cash for a minimal return.   
GEMINI, That energetic planet Mars is encouraging you to be impatient and reckless, so if you start issuing any orders or ultimatums now, you may land yourself in very hot water indeed. My advice would be to stick to your guns but tread very cautiously, especially in personal matters. CANCER It's time to check out your essential, inner, nature. Cancer is a water sign and, like all watery individuals, you are deeply caring and compassionate. Yet events at work may leave you feeling slightly bemused. Colleagues and associates just don't see things through your eyes. 
LEO, Lighten up and enjoy yourself. Venus, lady of love, is soon to line up in a special formation which promises affection to all but total hermits. Your associations with children should benefit and sons, daughters, nephews and nieces may be indulged to their hearts' delight. 
VIRGO, It's a mixed week, but a positive one. Changes at home should be temporary and superficial. However, even if you suspect that all your good work may eventually be undone, that is no excuse not to go ahead. Any worthwhile activity equals a useful experience even if the results are not what you expect. 
LIBRA, Get talking but be prepared to wait a little longer before you see your plans and ideas put into practice. By the end of the week you'll be clear about what must be done at home and will be able to compare notes with family members. If you really want to get them to see things your way, you must set a fine example. 
SCORPIO, Even if you feel that you have missed the boat there is still time to catch up. Friends and relations will make allowances for you, especially if you've made any generous gestures lately. You must be fair to friends and family, and all largesse must be equally distributed amongst all. 
SAGITTARIUS, You like to tell it as it is, which to some people means being rather tactless. However, right now you are at your most charming and persuasive, and straight talking may not be the best approach. Also, within seven days you'll hear news about a financial plan. 
CAPRICORN, Life can be full of all sorts of half-hidden undercurrents. However, an unexplained mystery will be cleared up soon, possibly within the week. Until then, you'll be fascinated by all sorts of gossip, rumours and hidden knowledge. Midweek favours domestic arrangements. 
AQUARIUS, None of us can exist entirely without human company and you still need partners' or close companions' support and co-operation if you are to tie up loose ends. However, people you meet next week may be more positive and helpful than those you've known for a long time. 
TAURUS, Even those of you who are not currently pre-occupied by work, must keep routine and domestic chores to the fore. Hold whatever discussions are necessary and see to it that partners and colleagues approve your intentions. I know it's a busy moment, but you'll manage just fine. 
GEMINI, These may be hectic and decisive days at home. There's no time to waste even if other people are urging you to compromise or be more flexible. Try to be cool and logical and don't get sucked into emotional confrontations, especially if they are likely to make a difficult situation worse. CANCER Your solar chart is a rather special one at the moment, mainly because you are basking under a stimulating set of alignments. New contacts are doing so much for your imagination, expanding your horizons. Yet you must never under-estimate the potential obstacles which may be placed in your path. 
LEO, You are now in the fortunate position of being able to realise certain dreams, especially those concerned with the very mundane field of work. You may be tempted towards fulfilling the ideal of service to the community. Deep inside you're in a somewhat saintly mood! 
VIRGO, There is still plenty of time to sort out your financial affairs. This is an ideal week to work out how to acquire extra funds. It's not a matter of luck, but of receiving the rewards you deserve. Plus, social stars beckon, so make sure you treat your friends well! 
LIBRA, It's not other people who are difficult to handle, it's your own deep anger and resentment going back years to the imagined slights and hurts of the past. Don't let such feelings spoil what could be a happy period. A short journey could offer a valuable distraction from more weighty matters. 
SCORPIO, You might find something out in a roundabout manner. Ironically, you may discover that there is in fact nothing to know, and that your hopes, fears or concerns were but a mirage. But, then, that is so often the case! Hopefully you'll be suitably relieved. 
SAGITTARIUS, Emotionally the ball is still in your court. This means that other people may be dependent on your goodwill but that in return you have certain obligations to discharge on their behalf. Anyway, you're still very much in the lead, cosmically speaking. 
CAPRICORN, There's a great deal going on behind the scenes, in addition to other events which may be only half explained. There is much to find out before you can push ahead with important personal plans. How and when you make your secrets public is a matter for your discretion. 
AQUARIUS, Let's look at the long-term for a change: more than ever, this is a time to boost your physical well-being through judicious changes in your diet and improvements in your exercise regime. Over the next three months, you will receive more offers and opportunities than you could ever have expected. 
TAURUS, You never did play all your trump cards in one go. Therefore, you are really in quite a strong position. At work, you can afford to be perfectly charming and considerate even to your rivals. Partners will be impressed if you set your sights on the long-term picture, and put short-term distractions in their proper place. 
GEMINI, It's the Moon which is important today;, indicating that other people have the emotional advantage. You may therefore have to grin and bear it as they play their little games, extracting what pleasure they can from winding you up. The golden rule is: never take the bait! CANCER You may not feel like sharing whatever good fortune comes your way, but you must realise that other people do deserve some of the rewards. Complicated emotional situations are not entirely their fault. You may bear some responsibility, so a little humility may be in order. 
LEO, The expensive phase you have been going through is due to continue for about another eight days. Therefore, you must expect a large bill or some other demand for money to arrive at almost any time. How you deal with it is up to you - and your good judgment. 
VIRGO, Battle may be commenced at home, but possibly not until tomorrow. You have a little time left to work out a strategy but also to complete any tasks or obligations which you have left undone. The real question, though, is a psychological one: why are you ready for a clash with authority? 
LIBRA, Your persuasive powers are strong, yet your grasp of the facts is slight. In your confusion you are nothing if not typical, for nobody has any real idea as to what is actually happening. Any light you can shed on the situation will be most welcome, even if partners don't fully get your drift! 
SCORPIO, As Jupiter gradually moves closer to a vital alignment with a number of other planets over the coming time, your chances of a breakthrough can only improve. However, when it comes, the change may be one of inner attitude rather than outer circumstances. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon, that most emotional and changeable of planets, is still at your beck and call. This means that you are in control at home and that all family arrangements may be shaped to your will. Can you really do it? I honestly feel that you can. 
CAPRICORN, Your best policy today may be to keep certain matters to yourself. There is nothing to be gained from talking to other people about your hopes, wishes or problems that can't be sorted out in private. What you have to do is wait until the time is right to speak your heart. 
AQUARIUS, Do make an effort to mix socially and get out and about as much as possible. Hopefully, people you meet now will go some way to improving your morale and restoring your battered confidence. There could be a bit of an emotional confrontation in the air, but at least the truth could come out at last. 
TAURUS, Please try and take everything that is suggested or intimated on the work front with just a grain of salt. However hard you probe, nothing of value will be revealed for at least another week. And when it does finally come to light, you will be able to alter your intentions. 
GEMINI, You don't need an astrologer to tell you that plans are being cancelled and arrangements broken. However, it may help you to know that many other people are in the same boat - you're not alone. It's all thanks to the planets' current uncertain shuffle. CANCER The present relationship between Jupiter and Mercury is one which encourages you to fight battles of principle, struggling for what is right. The only question is whether home life and family relationships are the appropriate focus for your energy. I think they are! 
LEO, Your selfless, charitable instincts will remain strong for the next nine months. Now you must make plans, working out how and when you can best put your skills and resources at other people's disposal. Co-operation is the way forward, even if it means that you have to put one of your own ambitions on hold. 
VIRGO, Mars is showing you that time is still on your side, so don't reproach yourself if you have been unable to reach certain goals. You can reckon on having ten days to bring your plans to fruition, with a short time afterwards for clearing up all the loose ends. 
LIBRA, No matter how hard you try to convince people that you know what you are doing financially, it does seem likely that you will eventually have to modify your plans and qualify some of your more determined statements. The fact remains, though, that your ideas are brighter than many people think. 
SCORPIO, There is an air of confusion and mystery about intensely personal interests, mainly due to the fact that Mercury, planet of communication and Venus, ruler of emotion, are occupying significant regions of your horoscope. Plus, your romantic life looks rather expensive! 
SAGITTARIUS, You are not a blinkered person, but you are capable of being deeply dogmatic about your personal affairs. Now, however, a refusal to change or adapt may start to prove rather costly. If there is any way to make the most of your relationships at the moment, it is to try to see how other people are feeling, to understand their desires as best you can. 
CAPRICORN, By all means express your opinions and air your frustrations, but please don't be surprised if people in authority react with irritation or attempt to increase your responsibilities. By the way, you are in for a period of emotional secrecy, so you'll be keeping many of your feelings to yourself. 
AQUARIUS, One thing is certain, which is that you must conduct all your personal affairs along the highest ethical grounds. This is not in order to make any personal gain, but because it's the right way to live at the moment. One piece of good news is that the pace of life is about to speed up again. 
TAURUS, You must acknowledge other people's right to go their own way, free from all emotional blackmail or other constraints. Your costs are increasing, so keep an eye on extra expenses. Also, if it's good advice you're after, you may need to look no further than someone you live with!  
GEMINI, There are domestic projects to be finalised, perhaps decoration or minor repairs. You really must complete all outstanding tasks before the end of the week, or at least attempt to reach a suitable stage. It's all a matter of persuading partners that you're doing your bit. CANCER Somebody now seems to be indicating that they are happy about a recent arrangement, but you might still have to put future plans on hold. Please do try to be tolerant of other people's little quirks and foibles. You might think you know what's best for them, but have you considered that you just might be wrong? 
LEO, We must look at the movements of Venus if we want to see the direction of your romantic and emotional life. Right now, this planet indicates that you'll be requiring intense commitment and security over the coming months. Passions are rising and hopes are high - but that doesn't mean they'll be met! 
VIRGO, You have a reputation for being rather staid, even though you have done enough in your life to persuade people otherwise. Indeed, partners may have cause to be shocked by a sudden burst of energy. Still, why shouldn't you spring the odd surprise on them? 
LIBRA, Mystical Mercury is making you aware that nothing can be taken for granted. However, any disappointments will be more than compensated for if you actively seek out pleasurable activities and experiences. In any case, you can only gain if you take new enterprises up a gear. 
SCORPIO, If you are prepared to pay heed to Mercury's rather eccentric aspects, you will plumb the depths of your psyche, discovering secrets that even you were unaware of. It's a time to solve mysteries, asking friends what they think, and consulting the experts. 
SAGITTARIUS, In recent weeks, you may have inadvertently alienated people in authority or colleagues who might have been useful to you. On the other hand, there are those who have been deeply impressed by your vigour. Your energy is high at the moment, but you must take care not to burn yourself up. 
CAPRICORN, Some of you have had to put up with a series of delays, disappointments and frustrations for months, if not years. However, please open your eyes to the fact that such suffering is not inevitable. If you have any sense you will tackle a rival on your own terms. 
AQUARIUS, Even though there will be those who resist any attempt to reach a binding agreement, you must bring pressure to bear on people who are dragging their heels over finances or property. The ball is in your court, so proceed with your normal appreciation of infinite possibilities. 
TAURUS, Once sensitive Venus alters its position, which should happen before too much longer, you will find it so much easier to relate to other people in a sensible, mature fashion. Do your best to clear up all misunderstandings before they become accepted wisdom. 
GEMINI, When Mercury is behaving in such an odd fashion, you must accept plans being cancelled or delayed. This could actually be to your advantage! Your main concern will be to press on and complete current projects regardless of whether partners agree or approve. After all, why should you always do what they want? CANCER Intriguing celestial patterns encourage you to go your own way. Please press on with optimism and absolute confidence in your unique destiny. As you've discovered in the past, the more you believe in yourself, the better your chances. Have faith in the future! READ | Short of repeal, Government is open to options and ready for long haul 
LEO, Please don't worry if social agreements seem hard to come by, or if your best-laid plans come to nought. It is in the nature of the times that all discussions and proposals should be put on hold. One thing you can be pleased about is that by next week partners will no longer be holding you back. 
VIRGO, There are ways and means of recouping your losses and, in the long-run, you will benefit from current developments. However, in the short-term, an established arrangement may come radically unstuck. You never know, though, it might be to your advantage if you're set free to reconsider your plans. 
LIBRA, Let others carp and criticise and play their pathetic little games. You have too much to think about to be involved with people who long ago abandoned any real desire to improve themselves. The time has come to give a firm 'no' to individuals who don't deserve your attention. 
SCORPIO, You must pay very close attention to what companions have to say. However, I doubt if you will be able to make very much sense of other people's intentions, as will become only too obvious after a few days. In a week of change, you must keep your options open.

SAGITTARIUS, You may be obliged to alter your tune, or at least amend your plans. However, in spite of any indications to the contrary, there is no threat to your longer-term hopes, wishes and ambitions. In fact, your stars are due to grow sweeter and more sympathetic. 
CAPRICORN, What can be done to salvage the situation at work, where your plans and proposals need a boost? Your best policy now may be to bide your time and wait for the tide to turn, as it surely will. Until then, you can continue to refine your ideas in secret. 
AQUARIUS, Last week, the excitable side of your nature was stimulated. This week, it is your more down-to-earth qualities which will come in handy, enabling you to avoid some of the confusion which afflicts your fellows. Take a practical approach and you'll gain a head-start on rivals. READ | Explained: Nature of economic recovery 
TAURUS, There's a pleasant and enjoyable trend in your chart, one which should encourage you to be spontaneous, rather than tied down and hide-bound. Hopefully, employers, partners and others who are relying on you will give you the space you need. If they don't, they're making a big mistake. 
GEMINI, The Moon is extra strong today - all day - and now is the time to catch up with domestic re-organisation which you had begun but never completed. Also, start to look at ways to lighten the atmosphere at work. You might also be prepared to speculate with future plans, dabbling in the untried and untested. CANCER Tomorrow's influential and emotional Moon is already having an effect on your mood and you may have cause to breathe a sigh of relief at home. It's very important indeed to be constructive and not to dwell on feelings which may now be irrelevant. 
LEO, New decisions and personal choices could well be dominated by money - by what you can and can't afford. Please avoid the tendency to place a monetary value on relationships though, deciding, for example, that one person is 'worth more' than another. 
VIRGO, It's the Moon's presence in your chart that is making you feel even more emotional and sensitive than usual. By late afternoon, you'll have the choice whether to relax and enjoy yourself - or deal with deep-seated questions. Oh, and take the opportunity to pamper yourself. 
LIBRA, You may keep yourself to yourself as much as you want. There is a great deal to be gained from a spot of solitude, and if other people are not perpetually intruding on your thoughts, you'll come up with some remarkable ideas. Your imagination has no limits. 
SCORPIO, There will be a change of mood very soon, once you have adjusted to Mercury's fresh position. You'll be enjoying a wave of nostalgia, impressed by traditional values and appreciative of old-fashioned entertainments. It's even possible that someone might turn up unexpectedly from your past. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should spare a thought for your personal life and consider whether you have spent too much time doing what other people want. Even if you still have too many responsibilities you should now try to take some time off. Honestly, you deserve a break! 
CAPRICORN, If money is a major issue lately, it's all to the good. You could be in line for an increase in your earnings, and it looks very much as if your best move now is to pursue unusual propositions which you may have ignored in the past. They might not work out, but at least you'll clarify your options. 
AQUARIUS, Now that Uranus, one of your planetary rulers, is proving so obstinate, it looks very much as if you'll be obliged to go back over old ground. You have a golden opportunity to right old wrongs, but don't blame other people for your mistakes. That would be unfair! 
TAURUS, Whenever the pace slows down, take the chance to rethink your plans in the light of fresh information. If other people should seem particularly critical or argumentative, don't take offence, but try to see the core of truth in their every statement. 
GEMINI, You're slowly building up to a break with the past that may have dramatic consequences for your personal life. You need to free yourself from stale attitudes, perhaps even dabbling in lifestyle changes. Remember, it may be you who needs to adapt, not partners. CANCER As the day progresses, the accent may shift from concern over specific details to a more general look at new possibilities. You're in a planning phase, so think about the future and look closely at all the options that are open to you. The last thing you want to do now is throw away all that you've worked for. Don't miss this: We explain how a Covid-19 vaccine travels from the factory to a syringe 
LEO, You're now coming to the end of a long period when money was under the microscope. Whether you have taken chances or not is your business, but from now on your decisions may be more restricted. But, with less choice, your life will become simpler and more relaxed. 
VIRGO, As Jupiter pulls into a new region of your chart, it's becoming increasingly likely that you'll have to be much more determined in future. The very worst thing you can do is to take your advantages for granted. In fact, complacency could be your undoing. Stay alert! 
LIBRA, You're going to have to take some very tough decisions, a few of which will concern work, others, personal affairs. Make sure you are well prepared, and that you have all the facts at your fingertips. Plus, try to tie up all loose ends while you still have the chance. Explained: Can Virat Kohli break Sachin Tendulkar's record? 
SCORPIO, You can begin to look forward to a period of relative emotional fulfilment. This is not upon you quite yet, but you can start to make plans, sure in the knowledge that others will soon be particularly susceptible to your charms. It is good to be popular! 
SAGITTARIUS, Your chart is brimming with energy, indicating that much of what you turn your hand to at present is designed to enhance your standing in the community. There are friends who are prepared to help, if only you would ask. If you don't say anything, you can't complain if you're ignored. 
CAPRICORN, There are ways and means to enhance your general sense of self-esteem. Start by aiming for promotion at work, and also take on social responsibilities. If you question your current methods of achieving your goals, you'll realise how you can do very much better. 
AQUARIUS, The road to interest and excitement lies far afield. This is therefore an excellent moment to revive foreign contacts and investigate an overseas journey. If you're pursuing ambitions in higher education, or just investigating a new interest, press ahead with confidence. Opinion: UP's ‘love jihad' ordinance has chilling effect on freedom of conscience 
TAURUS, Don't be deceived by what may be a relatively quiet start to the day. Mercury in an awkward aspect with Mars will keep you on the go, especially at work. If you are prepared for friction in purely routine affairs, you'll be able to turn it to positive advantage. 
GEMINI, It seems likely that tempers may fray, and one cause of irritation - as far as you are concerned - could be money. As the days pass the pressures on you to deal with urgent problems will increase, so beware of complacency. If you let things slide, others will step in and take control. CANCER Financial pressures should take your attention, even though what is on the agenda may be no more than the need to deal with ordinary family and domestic spending. It's just a question of getting everything settled as soon as you can. Just concentrate on one thing at a time - that's all it takes! 
LEO, You still seem to be in control, even though it will frequently feel as if you're being driven by your emotions. The secret is to realise that what you feel about other people is very much more to do with you than with them. That's an interesting thought, and could change your entire view about what you've been doing with your life. 
VIRGO, After all the emotional stress of recent times, you might now be expecting the roof to cave in. However, as long as you take the initiative at home, partners will be quite happy to let you run things your way. Mind you, do you really want to take charge? You'll soon find out! 
LIBRA, You're a diplomat, and your habit of keeping unpleasant facts to yourself is often a help. But, right now, with Mercury aligned with your sign, it may be a hindrance if there is information which other people are waiting to hear. You just have to find the right words. 
SCORPIO, For the third day in succession your personal ambitions should take first place. Other people cannot reasonably expect you to settle for second best, although by the end of the week conditions will have changed to the point where compromise is acceptable. 
SAGITTARIUS, According to your solar chart family relationships have been taken for granted too often. It is time you got on with home improvements because if you don't, nobody else will. If parents or older relations wish to force the pace, let them. And if younger people don't like it, you'll have to put them straight. 
CAPRICORN, There could be a change of scene very soon, perhaps causing you to abandon your normal schedule. Ideas and suggestions that are put to you by friends will be well worth pursuing in the short term, even if you feel that they're probably not right for you in the long run. 
AQUARIUS, You are used to mysteries but, with any luck, an outstanding question will be cleared up before long. If you've been pressing ahead with plans in secret, now is the time to reveal all, before others find out for themselves. Make sure you get your story in first. 
TAURUS, Don't be shy about your ambitions today. There is a certain time of the month when you should push yourself forward and take pride in your achievements, and that time is now. It goes without saying that professional Taureans should be pressing ahead. READ | Govt invites farm leaders for talks today; PM blames protest on ‘rumour' and ‘propaganda' 
GEMINI, By some strange astrological pattern, it's when the Moon is aligned with emotional regions of your chart, as it is today, that your celebrated talkativeness emerges in all its glory. It's time to take decisions and make choices - but not to issue promises from which you can't escape. CANCER You're coming up to another uncertain period at home, and it looks as if you may be on the move. Certainly, your ideas will be leaping along, and you should press on with all unusual suggestions. You might even discover a new role for yourself in an unlikely activity! 
LEO, The Moon is lifting your confidence. However, you may be feeling slightly wobbly emotionally, and if you're aware that you could be deeply affected by chance events, you'll be better placed to make a mature and considered response, and might earn fresh respect. READ | Q2 GDP silver lining has cloud: Demand down, Govt push is key 
VIRGO, You're coming to the end of a period in which the spotlight has been on you and your affairs. It's not over quite yet, but from now on you should make more of an effort to let other people take first place. A romantic secret may be revealed soon, hopefully to your relief. 
LIBRA, By tradition this is often a special and deeply personal time of year. This doesn't mean that everything will be easy, but that events that take place will help you to move forward to a new phase of life. Try to give yourself some extra time for quiet thought, just so that you get a fix on current changes. 
SCORPIO, The emphasis is very much on your worldly ambitions and career, although the available options depend mainly on whether you are prepared to accept new responsibilities over others. Once discussions with friends and colleagues are out of the way, the issues should be crystal clear. READ | Explained: A Hyderabad temple, and the city's name  
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon is in a special position which indicates that you could find yourself close to the centre of whatever is going on. It would be nice if you could let rip and do whatever you want. The only problem is that other people will expect you to be a saint! 
CAPRICORN, Financial involvements may spin out of control, and there are people who will expect you to take responsibility for affairs which are really none of your business. In love, the level of intensity will be raised, and by this time next week you might feel very pleased with yourself. 
AQUARIUS, You may now be beginning to realise that what once seemed so far away, so utterly unattainable, may soon after all be within your grasp. Turn your attention to educational matters, legal questions or overseas contacts and seize the moral high ground before you're criticised.

TAURUS, Life should be relatively quiet over the next few days, so you should be able to sidestep whatever pressures do come up. You may therefore have a welcome opportunity to recover from recent stress and strain. Use it! Very soon partners will be bombarding you with ideas. READ | I assure people that in a few months, we will have a vaccine, developed and researched in India: Harsh Vardhan 
GEMINI, It's all a matter of gaining on the roundabouts what you lose on the swings. The emphasis in your chart is on pleasure. This doesn't mean having fun and putting your feet up, but seeing to it that you extract all possible satisfaction and enjoyment from even the dullest routine. CANCER The Moon suggests that emotional tension now lies in the past, and that if you're still feeling a little stressed, it's because of events which took place last week or even earlier. If you have your wits about you, you can put it all into context - and even forget all about it! 
LEO, Domestic affairs will continue to niggle away at your peace of mind. However, there is little that can be done just yet, perhaps not until next week and probably not until four weeks' time. I know it's hard to wait, but that might be just what you have to do. READ | Explained: Farmers' big concern — and what the government could negotiate 
VIRGO, You're probably aware of your artistic talents, and you may also be very conscious that if the coming season is to be fruitful you should set out to develop all those personal skills which are all too often overlooked. No more excuses, please! 
LIBRA, Venus, your planetary ruler, is hesitating. The one conclusion is that you may leave aside various tired relationships, and begin to operate in almost any romantic sphere you choose. And the emphasis is on precisely that - deciding for yourself who you want to be with. 
SCORPIO, There's still a certain secrecy in your love life, although it must be said that your feelings are your business and yours alone. Respect confidences, have regard for other people's desires, and you should do just fine. And if someone wants to cool it for a while, that's fine, too. READ | Shameless is India's entry for Oscar in live-action short film category 
SAGITTARIUS, Your talents are many but you sometimes lack the determination necessary to develop them. However, this is a time of year when you should consider all appropriate ways to improve the quality of your life by linking up with like-minded people. At work, as they say, it's who you know that counts. 
CAPRICORN, In spite of your current doubts, a public or professional move, which is now becoming inevitable, will be for the better. Mercury, ruling your ideas, is forcing you to face up to long-range plans for a change. What it really insists, though, is that you broaden your horizons. 
AQUARIUS, There seems to be an element of personal rancour, and even though some causes lie in the past, it looks as if a certain amount of friction at work could persist over the coming weeks. It's up to you to direct your energies constructively, and not to fall into a time-wasting trap. READ | Australia outplayed us, players were ineffective with the ball: Virat Kohli 
TAURUS, I hope circumstances are on your side, because home is the place to be this week, deep in the bosom of your family. Even if you travel, as you may around the end of the week, the most attractive destinations will be places which have a homely feel about them. 
GEMINI, The promise of your horoscope is now being pushed forward by leaps and bounds. You might even discover that a loved one or younger relation comes up with just the idea you need to break the bank and set yourself up for life. CANCER If you only do one thing this week, see that it is to break with the habits of a lifetime and reform your entire approach to money, setting yourself on a prosperous course. Even love affairs may stumble unless you back your desires with suitable amounts of cash. READ | Six tunnels on Jammu border in four years: walkway, air pipes 
LEO, While the month emphasises work, this week's stars promote changes and you'll become steadily more concerned with personal questions. If you get as much as possible accomplished early on, you'll then have very much more time to throw yourself into the social whirl. 
VIRGO, You should be aware that partners might be in a difficult mood around Wednesday to Friday but, in reality, they're challenging you to change your attitudes and preconceptions. It's time for a few experiments with your lifestyle. 
LIBRA, Romance seems to be inseparable from travel, so a holiday affair may be revived, or you may find that a hint of far-away places is necessary to get your juices flowing. A deeper look at your chart also indicates that the religious side of your life requires a little attention. 
SCORPIO, You can't afford to be depressed for longer than five minutes. You have too much to achieve to waste any time, and the roots you put down at work, in love and at home will set you off on a new cycle of experience lasting anything up to eighteen months. READ | PB Mehta writes: What makes Barack Obama's book one of America's best memoirs 
SAGITTARIUS, Probably the most useful days for achieving your romantic ends are Monday and Thursday, and, if you are so inclined, a spot of emotional blackmail may be permissible! At the end of the week, the intervention of planets aligned with your house of pleasure suggests you can now let your hair down. 
CAPRICORN, To be brief, it's a period for organised fun and games, so enjoy the atmosphere and cast your cares aside. The only problem area could be work, where the storm clouds gather after the middle of the week, with possible flashes of lightning by Friday. 
AQUARIUS, You're a perfectionist by nature, and that's why you're always trying to make the world, or at least your corner of it, a better place. Much of your energy this week will be directed towards sorting out other people's little problems, if only because there's no other way you can feel settled. READ | How Army is staying fighting fit at LAC during winter 
TAURUS, It's time for some of your typical intuitive foresight.

You might not go for what's on offer, and something completely different could catch your eye! READ | GDP shrinks 7.5% in Q2; manufacturing picks up, services sector worst hit 
GEMINI, Romantic attachments could take an intense turn, which will no doubt be deeply satisfying. However, you may be inclined to judge others a little too harshly. The moment you start comparing one person unfavourably with another, you're in danger of letting your personal feelings interfere with the truth. CANCER This may not be the best time to lay down the law, for partners, colleagues and rivals have strong opinions of their own. It's much better to ask them what they think, and turn this to your own advantage. You might be able to use their arguments to show them why they should take more notice of you! 
LEO, This should be a busy period, and time set aside for relaxation may be curtailed by additional duties incurred as partners, children or friends present you with fresh demands. Actually, you could be happier to be active than left with time on your hands. READ | UP cops take away 15-year-old for ‘threatening' CM, family seeks answers 
VIRGO, There is no need to be more shy and retiring than usual. In fact, you may dust down your neglected or forgotten creative skills and theatrical qualities. Life should be approached in a spirit of spontaneity, youthful vigour and a willingness to take whatever comes. 
LIBRA, You may now have the determination to implement family changes or home improvements which once seemed beyond your power. Even hopes which you thought would always remain as fantasies may now be put into action. And about time too, some people would say! 
SCORPIO, You might feel as if you're facing an uphill struggle. If you don't seem to be making any headway, it's probably because you have not done enough to persuade other people that they have just failed to appreciate the truth, and that you are right. It's never too late to have another go! READ | Stan Swamy, 83, waits as the buck is passed on his sipper and straw 
SAGITTARIUS, I's not a bad moment for shopping trips, although there seems to be a planetary law in operation which says that whatever money you have when you leave home will be spent by the time you return. You don't have to give in to it, though. A simple solution is to keep your wallet tight shut! 
CAPRICORN, A sociable Moon is just the tonic you need to lift your morale and enable you to believe in yourself. If you should have moments of self-doubt, don't ignore them, but make use of the opportunity to discover exactly why your confidence has slipped. 
AQUARIUS, Relatively secretive stars might force you to adjust your social priorities. The most pleasant gatherings will be discreet and involve just one or two favoured people. It's an enlightening moment to pursue any spiritual or mystical interests. Stories of Strength | 2,000 km from home, giving back to a state that feels like one 
TAURUS, It is time to capitalise on all property and other investments. It's also a highly auspicious moment for making your feelings abundantly clear at home, and for pursuing all overseas or foreign contacts. You might not succeed - at least not now. But you will prepare the ground for the future. 
GEMINI, This is a fine moment to consider the world, and your place in it, from a more businesslike perspective. There have been periods when you were inclined to be a little too rash with money, but right now you should attempt to balance the books. You'll thank yourself in the future. CANCER The profile of personal relationships is being raised once again. You may discover that other people respond to your feelings in unexpected ways. You had probably even given up hope of eliciting any support at all. Perhaps you were asking the wrong people! READ | Fields to doorsteps: Nashik businessman keeps supply chain running 
LEO, You appear to be wrestling with your conscience, but it is doubtful whether you could have acted in any other way than you did, especially at home. Some kind of a professional commitment has to be made, but there may be no money involved. An idealistic approach should work best. 
VIRGO, You should make some strategic moves to secure family agreements. More important than practical repairs or changes is the need to introduce a dash of colour and a hint of luxury. Family gatherings look auspicious, just as long as you take it upon yourself to generate a good atmosphere. 
LIBRA, You stand a much better chance of reaching agreement on matters of substance over the next year if you begin by giving other people the benefit of the doubt. Also, you may combine emotional openness with financial generosity: the greatest pleasure should come from giving, not from taking.

SCORPIO, There is a great deal to play for at the moment, and if your choices are based solely on what is of practical benefit, you are bound to convert a potential loss into a decent profit. Romantic adventures might prove costly, so if you're going to subsidise someone, make sure that they're worth it! 
SAGITTARIUS, You may turn your attention to financial matters today. Even minor transactions could have major consequences, a thought which should be sufficient to keep your attention on the facts. Consider the details, for you will ignore the small print at your peril. 
CAPRICORN, You are well within your rights to dig your heels in, especially when you're dealing with all matters of a strictly intimate nature. Whether you will get away with it is another question, so you should act only when you judge that the time is right.

AQUARIUS, Others might get the wrong impression if you refuse to take them into your confidence. This is one of those times when you should be prepared to trust everybody, certain in the knowledge that they will respond as best as they can. Keep your options open at work, though. 
TAURUS, Your business stars are strong, and looking increasingly constructive. Both on the financial and personal levels, it is clear that choices you make now will be of lasting value, perhaps more so than you suspect. The only snag is that it might be some time before you see this. 
GEMINI, Teamwork and partnership are still the order of the day and, even if you're thinking of breaking an arrangement, it should be with partners' agreement. Plus, at work, it will be your personal feelings which count. But don't forget the facts, though. Follow Cyclone Nivar LIVE updates CANCER Your energy level goes through a slight jolt. You'll either be getting back to work after a break, or at least returning to your duties with renewed enthusiasm following recent distractions. This trend will be enhanced if you focus on the areas which actively engage your finer qualities. 
LEO, You should soon have the perfect opportunity to take stock, and work out how exactly you may free yourself from certain constraints. Above all, you should concentrate on those areas of your life which allow you to indulge your theatrical and dramatic qualities. 
VIRGO, Money has often been in short supply, but your new long-term cycle reveals that your prosperity is likely to increase. The first indication should be a change in attitudes. A feeling that you are more prosperous will precede the actual change in circumstances. 
LIBRA, Today's stars are generally rather lively, and you will have a number of choices set out before you. The whole question revolves around whether you are ready to put matters of the heart before everything else. If you are, then you might have to make a sacrifice somewhere else. Follow Farmers protest LIVE updates 
SCORPIO, You may be subject to greater than average mood swings today. It's good to know this in advance, because then you'll be sustained through any low points by the knowledge that better times are on the way. If there's one thing that's constant, it's change! 
SAGITTARIUS, Mars and Pluto are perfectly aligned in sensitive places in your chart. You would do well to sit back and contemplate your future, making plans for the next year at least. But, in the meantime, you need to work fast to avert an upcoming emotional collision. 
CAPRICORN, Discretion is the better part of valour. You may spare a little time for solitary pursuits, for those things which are sometimes ignored because they please you but don't interest partners. You may, if you wish, leave family spending until next week. 
AQUARIUS, Public and professional affairs seem to be more important than the purely personal. This doesn't mean that you're becoming a workaholic, for community and social responsibilities should also be taking much of your time. Somebody deserves your attention - so don't hold back. READ | Diego Maradona — his hand with God 
TAURUS, Taurus: Business affairs must take as much of your attention as required. Do be sure not to play free and easy with other people's money though, as your view of the facts is coloured by what you would like to be true, rather than by what actually is true.

GEMINI, Gemini: Your romantic stars are now looking very powerful. The Moon and Venus, two very emotional planets, are so aligned as to get your feelings moving and, in the right circumstances, set your heart on fire. Of course, what you need is the perfect person to appear, and that's an unknown quantity. CANCER Cancer: You tend to see everything as either black or white, a perhaps inevitable consequence of the need to choose between different options. Try to be more flexible; both recent successes and disappointments have made you more tolerant of others, perhaps with good reason. 
LEO, Leo: You may let go of the past a little, especially at home. The emphasis today is on relations with children which, on a psychological level, indicates that you can also be more childlike. This of course means that you can enjoy yourself more than usual! READ | Congress leader Ahmed Patel passes away after battling with Covid-19 
VIRGO, Virgo: A partner or colleague may be ready to clinch a deal which will do you a power of good, especially at home. If you can force the pace and get others to divulge all they know, then do so, but please go gently. After all, your goal is to get at the truth, rather than to prove that you were right. 
LIBRA, Libra: Today's personal choices and decisions are likely to be made in a spirit of optimism. This is fine just as long as you realise that conditions may have changed by the time you come to implement them, so include a few safeguards. That's only commonsense! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You might have been misled or misinformed, but you may put it all down to a general communications breakdown rather than to any general malice. Your plans should now be shaped by how much cash you have in your purse. You'll have to work within your limits: there is no other choice!

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The next few days could find you waking up, as if from a deep sleep. You'll begin to realise that situations which seemed so confused are really very straightforward. At home you may give a child or younger relation one hundred and one per cent support. Nothing less will do. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Sometimes the pressure of deciding what to do next is just too great! You may well feel like withdrawing from the fray, and why not? You have received quite a battering from certain people in the recent past, and you might conclude that now it's time to look after number one. In other words, you! 
AQUARIUS, Aquarius: You will always have a great need for comfort and stability, but recently you have felt this slipping away. Don't worry. It's just that a curious series of planetary cycles is saving the best for next week. If you give a little now, then you'll receive much more later!

TAURUS, You still need to pay a great deal of attention to partners' hopes and worries. The fact is that a little generosity of spirit now will pay dividends in the future, when others will show sympathy for you. Plus, if someone you live with has been standing in your way, they will soon lose interest in holding you back. 
GEMINI, You should pay a little attention to your physical well-being, resolving yet again to get into shape and fixing yourself up for the future. It follows that a fair degree of self-discipline is necessary and your motto should be work now and play later. Read | Oxford vaccine ‘highly effective'; Pune lab says in India very soon CANCER There's an intensity in the air today which belies many people's casual appearance. Actually, this could be a pleasurable and fulfilling moment if you give your personal skills and talents a higher priority than the pressures of duty and routine. 
LEO, There could be changes at home. If you press ahead today you'll discover that you have spare time tomorrow as pressures lift in a sort of chain reaction: as soon as one problem is removed, others will disappear like mirages in the desert. It could be amazing, really! 
VIRGO, You are well used to playing a waiting game, but it now looks as if you are sufficiently sure of your own ideas to be able to put your plans into action. This is especially the case at home, where relatives will soon be persuaded that you are right. Also Read | Former ministers, officers in list of illegal land deal beneficiaries in J&amp;K 
LIBRA, You are, perhaps, a little too weighed down by financial cares, and to some it has looked as if your natural indecision has done you no favours. This is not the case, as you are shortly to find out. There is another factor to consider - that a figure in authority may need to be appeased. 
SCORPIO, The Moon continues playing its full part, so you're still likely to be dominated by your heart rather than your head. If you want to plan for the future, you can do no better than get your finances into order. What you really need to do is win partners' trust - and keep it. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's time for musing on what exactly makes you, and partners, tick. Your psychological insights are likely to be good, if not spot on. They'll certainly be sharp enough to enable you to get the utmost from a coming deal. You can also, as it happens, do your best for partners. Read | SIT probe into ‘love jihad' rules out conspiracy angle, outside funding 
CAPRICORN, You are often given little credit for your loyalty to your friends, in spite of your best efforts! Your commitment may be tested and, if you're typical of your sign, you'll be prepared to make allowances for others' little weaknesses. That sounds like good news. 
AQUARIUS, Recent decisive moves have created waves in both your personal  and professional life. You may feel a little vulnerable at work, but the way to succeed at the moment is to plan ahead as far as possible, in the knowledge that rivals are thinking only in the short-term. 
TAURUS, Your relationships should be going through a relatively lively patch, and your hopes will be fulfilled as long as you follow certain ground rules; it is absolutely necessary to sympathise with others' predicaments and to do your level best to help them achieve their aims. 
GEMINI, This is an ideal moment to throw yourself into new affairs with a total commitment, not only to fulfilling all your responsibilities, but to completing them as well as you can. With a little extra thought, you might even overcome a major long-term obstacle in a few days' time. READ | Azad underlines again: Congress needs revamp, leaders have no connect CANCER Last week's conflicts and strains should now be calming down. It seems certain that the causes of any friction lie in the past, so personal problems may now be settled much more effectively than once seemed possible. You can now face the future with confidence. 
LEO, Close companions may expect that you continue to provide them with support and assistance, but you may actually do them a good turn if you defy their hopes and insist that they start doing certain things for themselves. Also, if you feel trapped in the past then there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 
VIRGO, It is a marvellous moment for finally letting other people know how you feel. There's an interesting link between emotional and intellectual regions of your chart which will lend your words an appealing emotional intensity. When your natural perfectionism comes out, all you can do is your best! 
LIBRA, On a material level your horoscope talks of the need to manage domestic spending much better than in the past, but the real message is psychological. You should permit yourself to be undervalued and taken for granted no longer. It's about time you were given your share of respect. READ | Himanta Biswa Sarma Interview: 'NRC, CAA no longer the discourse. Issue now is conflict of cultures, this claim of Miya identity' 
SCORPIO, The Moon puts you in a very strong position, which should be a morale-booster for you. It indicates that your emotions might be slightly more unsteady than usual, but that should be something that you're more than happy to live with. There might be a cost, but one you can afford. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may promote professional and worldly ambitions ruthlessly today. You have a chance to gain in responsibility, authority and prestige, which is not to be lightly ignored. But don't imagine that doing the best for yourself means doing other people down. It doesn't! 
CAPRICORN, Romantically you have every reason to keep yourself to yourself but, in other respects, it looks as if collaboration is necessary. Even at work there'll be a social dimension which will soon be impossible to ignore. The message has to be that co-operation is the only way forward. 
AQUARIUS, Life should still be relatively secretive. Just why you are reluctant to confess your feelings is your business, but you can rely on an increase in your confidence, with good consequences all round, within a few days. You should feel better once news from the past has arrived. READ | Rise of a cleric: how did Khadim Rizvi become so influential in Pakistan? 
TAURUS, At last you're coming out of your shell, and when your confidence is at its height, you may surprise friends by your willingness to take the lead. Your mood is generally lively and yet you are still keeping your desires to yourself. 
GEMINI, You can afford to take a fairly laid-back approach. After all, everything - or almost everything - is going your way. You will soon have a spring in your step and a winning way with words. You may, though, forget the facts, especially as Friday approaches. READ | LSR student suicide: 'If I can't study, I can't live' CANCER You have to lay down the law at home, but you can't actually make other people obey your every word! All you can do is rely on the power of persuasion - and hope against hope that it succeeds! If you're chasing a new job, a friend will point you in the right direction. 
LEO, You may press on with professional and other worldly ambitions and don't listen to people who seem determined to undermine you. And if you can get away from your usual environment for a few days, you'll do yourself a power of good. 
VIRGO, Sometimes you feel as if you're in danger of being left behind. You probably imagine that other people are making all the running, which doesn't seem particularly fair. However, you may actually benefit by hanging back and letting partners take the lead. 
LIBRA, Marital matters look light and bright, but are heading for passion towards the end of the week. And when that happens you really can't say whether the simplest matters will work out as planned. The Moon, which heightens your emotions, is heading straight for sensitive regions of your chart. READ | Whole nine yards: Berlin to Mumbai, Salvi's sari run 
SCORPIO, Positive financial news is on the way, and you'll soon hear the details. There might be a few surprises, although by and large, the results should be as expected. At work, though, you may have to wait another month for a decision on that new responsibility. 
SAGITTARIUS, Those two tough planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are pulling you in two directions. So, you can't really be blamed if you feel stuck between irreconcilable options. Good, solid family relationships are a priority in the meantime. 
CAPRICORN, This week is almost perfect for leisure, pleasure and love. All you have to do is clear your diary and make sure that you're in the right place at the right time. At home, there's still a chance of a surprise party or a little extra colour and comfort. 
AQUARIUS, Nothing stays the same for ever. In fact, you're coming up to rush hour in the romantic department. But why exactly are partners so impatient or irritable? Mars, planet of war, is also stirring up hidden feelings, encouraging you to stand up for yourself. Opinion | Tavleen Singh writes: It was wrong for the Home Minister to describe a coalition of Kashmiri political parties as a ‘gang' 
TAURUS, The pursuit of pleasure is quite compatible with the general tone of the times. Given that you're approaching a powerful planetary picture, this is no time for complacency. On the other hand, you can allow yourself a few treats today. You deserve it! 
GEMINI, The pace of events at home is due to become much faster, largely as a result of a recent lunar alignment. One way or another, family members demand your full attention. Artistic types should put much more energy into accomplishing their personal goals. CANCER Mars is now rushing through your chart, stirring up all those deep, long-buried feelings. Please remember that quickness to anger also requires a readiness to forgive and that, having said your piece, you should allow the past to recede - and eventually fade away. 
LEO, It's a fine day for a spot of shopping. For those of you chasing property deals the auspices are favourable though, in general, today's stars talk about casual spending as a path to temporary happiness. But, as you know, long-term solutions require deeper answers. 
VIRGO, You specialise in sweeping things under the carpet. However, little events that happen today are a harbinger of what is to come - namely an increasing talent for exposing skeletons in cupboards! Tomorrow represents a symbolic fresh start - and so does the day after! 
LIBRA, Although you have a reputation for generosity, the overwhelming trend of your chart is now towards putting yourself first. In many ways I feel that this is a necessary preparation for the next three-month cycle. First, you need to own up to a mistake, and work out how not to repeat it! 
SCORPIO, You may give even more attention to new associates and old friends. Your lunar pattern works a double game, probably bringing new people into your life, but urging you to get in touch with those ancient acquaintances who are a bit like part of the furniture! 
SAGITTARIUS, The astrological universe sets certain tests and tasks. Everything that is done is done for a purpose, and if you are challenged or criticised, you are being done a very good turn. If you must blame something, blame the stars! Mind you, that still won't let you off the hook. 
CAPRICORN, Perhaps an adventure you've been dreaming of for years is now on the cards. It might be that your fantasies are emotional as much as anything else. It could be a vision of the perfect home and family. Whatever it is, you can bring it a little closer today. Hopefully other people will play ball! 
AQUARIUS, You have waited too long for your just rewards to give up now. But, merely because one association is fading from the scene, that doesn't mean that you'll be left high and dry. What you're going to discover from now on is that you will attract the right people at the right time. 
TAURUS, The future is looking somewhat strange, not to say curious. However, before you move any further there seems to be a need for stabilising the situation at home. This may mean literally carrying out repairs but it could equally refer to an urgent need to get an emotional grip on things. 
GEMINI, Your horoscope has focused increasingly on your financial situation in recent times, but this is all due to change next week. What you can do is look back and try to discover how your psychological pressures and attitudes were responsible for any financial mistakes - or successes. CANCER Personally and emotionally, this is still a good time to swallow your pride. This is not a forecast I relish, mainly because self-effacing humility comes too easily to you. However, home is one area where you can assert yourself, given sufficient motivation. 
LEO, The Moon's sweep through your solar chart is going to bring the curtain down on an emotional disposition and on a set of relationships which can be traced back over the past twelve months. There could be one last encore, but it's time to move on. 
VIRGO, A lifetime of exploitation is soon to be done away with, but first you may have one last service to perform. Do it now and give yourself a further four weeks to tidy away all those loose ends. If you're making any resolutions, a useful one would be to get value for money in future. 
LIBRA, Your social stars are certainly looking strong. A classic partnership between the Moon and Venus is actually a fine indication that those of you in search of love are shortly to get together with someone new. At least, you may be destined to transform a current relationship into something better. 
SCORPIO, Business and pleasure seem to combine, as do home and work. This is actually a rather good moment to bring together different areas of your life, including those which have until now existed in separate bubbles. You might be surprised to discover that friends who have never met actually like each other. 
SAGITTARIUS, A fine set of planets is sending you extremely favourable influences, but they're also in the midst of their own celestial muddle. The only advice I can offer is to accept different invitations and pursue various activities even if they do seem to contradict each other. Who knows, it could be fun! 
CAPRICORN, Bearing in mind everything I've said and written about financial responsibility, you may still allow yourself a brief bout of extravagance. Yet your habits and desires have already moved on, and you know that you can no longer buy emotional happiness. 
AQUARIUS, You have certainly been through the mill emotionally. Events that take place now and over the next few days indicate that you may put the past behind you. This doesn't necessarily mean forgetting, but it does mean forgiving. Your generosity of spirit will be appreciated. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Don't make too much of a song and dance at home, and keep your head if family relationships are still in a state of flux. This is no time to start utterly untried and experimental new ventures. Instead you should be making rapid moves to clear up loose ends. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Today's unforeseen events could be expensive, at least more costly than you thought. Rather than resisting the trend of the stars, why not go with the flow, get out your savings and have yourself a little treat? Lay your feelings on the line and try to get someone close to give you an answer. CANCER Cancer: Everything that happens over the next forty-eight hours will edge you decisively into the future. You may not believe it, but this also goes for developments which might be initially disappointing. A course of action which is derailed now would probably not have succeeded in any case. 
LEO, Leo: Anyone who still believes that you are too nice to create a stir had better think again. However, just in case you become complacent, let me point out that you need to secure as much support as possible for your plans. You might even be able to turn a rival into an ally. 
VIRGO, Virgo: A certain amount of friction is inevitable, and could even be helpful, and the main point of contention seems to be financial. You had probably better realise now that the future is uncertain and that you therefore have opportunities to better yourself. 
LIBRA, Libra: Mars is sailing happily through your chart, but the results may make you squirm. Over the next month you are liable to be in the situation where you unintentionally offend people and then have to spend a great deal of time apologising. Always remember - it could be worse! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Foreign and overseas factors seem to be strong. At the very least, a long-distance invitation is looming. Perhaps there's room ahead for a break, or perhaps it's time to brush up on a language. Family members who are far away should be contacted soon. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: This is certain to be a day of financial intrigue. There are bargains to be had, for sure, but what is really and truly important is a monetary partnership. Working matters impinge on your consciousness, perhaps because you're about to remember something which you ought to have done, but didn't. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Let others make the first move and don't try to force what can only be a delicate matter. If you wait for partners to show their hands, then you'll have a clear idea of what you must do next. But these are sensitive times, and subtle decisions are called for. 
AQUARIUS, Aquarius: There are so many thought-provoking aspects at the moment that you could be turning into quite a philosopher. Partners should appreciate your wisdom, and you should enjoy their wit. A romantic connection should soon be restored, by the way, though perhaps not as expected.

AQUARIUS, There are so many thought-provoking aspects at the moment that you could be turning into quite a philosopher. Partners should appreciate your wisdom, and you should enjoy their wit. A romantic connection should soon be restored, by the way, though perhaps not as expected. 
TAURUS, You should be aware that when the planetary brakes are applied, it could be for very good reasons. It may well prevent you from making hasty decisions now, especially as far as work is concerned, including partners' work. Press ahead at home and do whatever pleases you. 
GEMINI, The road you're on is a long one, and there really is no knowing how far you can travel and what you will encounter on the way. The one splendid indication in your chart, though, connects love with short journeys. Travel in the pursuit of your heart's desire, perhaps? Agusta Westland Deal | Statement of key accused mentions Kamal Nath's son, Khurshid, Patel, web of offshore firms CANCER The time has come to build bridges and re-establish links with those who have made life difficult. You may be seized with new energy at home, not to mention fresh enthusiasm for making constructive improvements and alterations. As you know, a positive attitude breeds success. 
LEO, There are always balancing factors in any situation. What is hopeful from the long-term point of view now is that even if you have squandered an opportunity, sooner or later someone else will make it up for you. You can get the ball rolling, so don't hang around. 
VIRGO, Get up to date at work. Professional ambitions are one thing, but you should also pursue any worthwhile aims and goals which will enhance your general standing in the community. Just watch out for a spot of cosmic friction around mid-morning, or mid—afternoon. Read | Karunanidhi's elder son Alagiri likely to form a political outfit, join BJP-led alliance 
LIBRA, Don't force others to divulge what they are not at liberty to reveal. You'd probably do best to let them have their say in their own good time. There is a lot to be said for taking expert advice, perhaps even concerning a legal affair. Money matters are now set to improve. 
SCORPIO, All the painful lessons of the past will now prove to have been worth it. Certain emotional stresses and strains will eventually ease as the Moon passes from a dry and dusty part of your chart to a soft and sensitive one. The results should be to your liking. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may consider what is best for all in the long run and, in so doing, discover that principles are more important than people. Loyalty to friends or associates who do not deserve it may not help the situation. The alternative is to offer honest and constructive criticism.

CAPRICORN, It's a positive moment, so grasp the initiative. What takes place today may make it clear that you should be on the move. However, only when current problems have been dealt with will associates stop pressurising you. You've got to get your act together first, though. Having decided to alter your life so that someone close doesn't feel neglected, there is now no way back. As you will soon come to realise, promises cannot be made and unmade on a whim. Actually, what this period is really about is combining responsibility to others with your own freedom of movement. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Today's sparkling Mercury-Venus partnership is an excellent indication of financial success, and indeed of correct decisions in every field. You are especially favoured if large domestic expenditure is underway. If you're in the housing market, have hope in your heart. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Your first step in the right direction is to square awkward issues with loved ones. If you wish to declare your desires, or tell someone how you feel about them, there is no time so good as the present. Once in a while, you are able to soar to poetic heights. Find the right words - and do it!

Before you go wild though, this wonderful state of affairs only holds true for a short while, so do your best to pick up whatever bargains you can today. But it could be emotional gains you're looking at, rather than financial. 
LEO, Leo: Teamwork seems to be very important, but then isn't it always? But this time I am talking about genuine co-operation, in which you really do sit down and find out what other people want, and then do your best to fit in! Your role could be to open your more stuffy friends' eyes to new options. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Your secret fantasy life has been growing ever stronger, which is probably a very good thing indeed. You see, today's strange imaginings will become tomorrow's reality, so dream on. Also, accept any responsibility at work very willingly. It might seem like a burden now, but could bring hidden bounties. READ | An Expert Explains: How to read serosurveys 
LIBRA, Libra: Now you should be able to enjoy the company of people who once seemed to be so remote or unapproachable. Also, when looking at family connections, it seems to be long-distance links which are most important. In fact, this could be a time to build bridges. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There is one last minor fracas waiting at work, or in some public area, but not just yet. I'm telling you this now so that you can continue to maintain your position and take elementary precautions as far as certain people are concerned. If you avert a problem, then your reputation will shoot up. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Something that occurred towards the end of last week should have made it blatantly apparent that someone has been wasting your time. Don't blame them, though, for the fault lies elsewhere. What I really mean by that is that people who get it wrong may have been caught out by changing circumstances.

CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The Sun is a neutral sort of a star, symbolically speaking, but is now making a helpful aspect to Uranus, a difficult planet. The inescapable conclusion is that you can now transform a problem into a great boon. But do you have the required concentration? I hope so! AQUARIUS Aquarius: It is time to buy chocolates, send flowers and write love letters. In other words, the moment has come for totally traditional declarations of your feelings. When dealing with money, concentrate on giving rather than spending. Don't worry - you should get it back, probably in kind. 
TAURUS, You should probably pay more attention to family affairs over the coming few weeks. There are a number of ways in which you can brighten up your home, including a spot of decorating. You may not be aware of any plans to move house now, but some people will be upping sticks soon. 
GEMINI, The heat is off in most financial matters, at least for now. On the other hand, you're going to be obliged to explain yourself better in future. Your travel stars are looking considerably more lively and many short trips are forecast over the next month. CANCER Many of you sensitive people will be too wound up in an emotional whirlwind to bother about ordinary day-to-day issues. You may be having too much fun to notice that the Sun is now offering you a wonderful chance to set yourself up financially for the next few years! 
LEO, A number of planets are now occupying a colourful region of your solar chart. I am happy to tell you that, for the next few weeks, you will therefore be granted a tremendous degree of celestial protection and help. And just as well, too, you might say! 
VIRGO, It's because you're such a discreet and serious person that you can be so reserved - and happy with your own company. But strangely it's because the Sun is so supportive that you're entering a phase in which all your quiet, delicate and delightful qualities are about to become much more noticeable. All your hard work should be rewarded in about six months' time. 
LIBRA, Wednesday and Thursday should be your best days, for these will be the times when the Moon encourages you to do your best. If you've family arrangements to confirm or useful repairs to implement, Friday is the day. 
SCORPIO, There's so much going on in your stars that it's difficult to know where to start! Venus is probably your brightest planet, offering the chance of romance to all adventurous individuals, no matter what their age or inclination. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're entering a marvellous period for travel and long-distance adventure and if you've delayed a well-deserved rest until now, then get on and make your plans. Business and pleasure seem to mix in strange ways and you'll gain from past investments in old artifacts or the arts. 
CAPRICORN, You may have no choice but to allow other people to take the lead. However, if you do put yourself second, you'll gain enormously. First, close partners will become much more appreciative and loving. Secondly, new vistas will open in your most personal affairs. AQUARIUS Working and ambitious individuals will happily soon find that relationships with colleagues will improve. A partner is also about to shed light on all sorts of personal questions that have remained unanswered until now. 
TAURUS, You may look back over the past week and consider that you have really done rather well, all things considered. An absence of stressful planetary aspects today and tomorrow gives you some space to rest. In fact, you can benefit from a wonderfully romantic relationship between Venus and Neptune. 
GEMINI, The signs are that warring factions have now settled their differences. If peace has broken out, you will be able to take advantage of the fact that this is an optimum time for holidays, adventures and long-distance journeys. Hopefully, you are free to exploit such opportunities. READ | Happy Diwali 2020: Wishes, images, status, quotes, messages, wallpapers, photos and cards CANCER You could be in for a working weekend. Not, perhaps, in the formal sense of carrying out paid employment, more in that you'll be pursuing chores that are leading towards some important long-term goal. It's not just a matter of doing what you want, either, but of helping other people with their plans. 
LEO, The emphasis is still very much on what can only be described as partnership or joint interests. You have a very great deal indeed to gain from a number of new associations and personal connections. But it may be next week before you can really see the full picture. 
VIRGO, The Sun and Mercury are still helping you clear up a number of personal uncertainties. You may let others make the first move and don't try to force intensely personal issues. 'Go with the flow' as the modern mystics say, and see what happens. You never know - you may have your eyes opened! 
LIBRA, If money appears to be in short supply the reason may lie in recent mismanagement, but the underlying causes seem to stretch way back to the distant past and a host of attitudes to finances that were unfortunately foisted upon you. You'll soon have a chance to make your own way. READ | Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari review: Loud, unfunny movie 
SCORPIO, It seems that loved ones are now ready to move forward but you occupy an important role in their affairs and must be ready to confer your approval, support and blessing. As far as your own affairs are concerned, make money matters your priority. Perhaps you actually need to make more money! 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon cruises into a highly promising position. Thus, by the time you wake up, the vague traumas of recent days should be a thing of the past and you'll be free to enjoy the weekend in peace. You could even pick up a bargain or make an unexpected profit. 
CAPRICORN, You may have difficulty making sense of the world today. Perhaps the odd things that people say will seem to lack meaning - or the facts will be at variance with what you had come to expect. But that's often the case at this point in the lunar cycle. IN PICS | Ayodhya witnesses Deepotsav grandeur as over 5 lakh diyas light up Saryu banks on Diwali eve AQUARIUS Your planetary ruler, Saturn, has benefited from a long series of harmonious aspects, which means that you should be in a relatively strong and secure position. At any rate, circumstances are on your side, mainly because you can stick to your guns. 
TAURUS, Think very carefully about your long-term hopes and wishes, and make sound and sensible plans to get what you want. It's a day to listen to advice, read instructions, and generally pay heed to people who know what they're talking about. They, in their turn, may find that your ideas are a lot more creative than they realised. READ | AG nod for contempt case against Kunal Kamra over tweets 
GEMINI, Today's lunar patterns offer you all the chances you need to deal with routine chores and tasks. This may sound rather dull, but get as much as you can under your belt today and you'll thank your good sense at the weekend. By the way, if you want to slip out of an obligation, next week could give you the chance. CANCER Mercury's relationship with Venus favours sensible people doing sensible things in sensible ways. It also enables you to do the practical work necessary to get your dreams off the drawing board. First of all, though, you'll have to pay the costs, and these could be greater than expected. 
LEO, If you enjoy intrigue and behind-the-scenes manipulation, as we all do to some degree or another, you may do your best now. There is much that you can do to help other people without them knowing about it. I'm sure you'll get your thanks in a few days' time. READ | Explained: India likely to enter technical recession, what does this mean? 
VIRGO, You have refused to buckle under the strain, and all credit to you for your resolve and resilience. Personally, and professionally, the world is your oyster, so you may approach the immediate future with great confidence. If you still have any doubts, consult the experts one last time. 
LIBRA, Your stars are generally optimistic and advantageous, so if you are anxious to get off the treadmill at work, now would seem to be a good time to do it. Find ways to lighten up! Over the next few days, you will be free to question your professional priorities  with positive results. 
SCORPIO, You are much too sensible to blame the stars for anything that goes wrong. Yet now that the Moon is gracing you with its benevolent rays you must realise that the celestial configuration shares some responsibility for your major achievements. 
SAGITTARIUS, There's definitely an undercurrent in the air today. You're never happy when emotions get intense and feelings run high, and that is just what is likely to happen. You'll probably be left in the dark regarding a number of significant questions - just for now. READ | Krunal Pandya questioned at Mumbai airport over luxury watches 
CAPRICORN, Your financial affairs certainly look set to prosper. Bear in mind the following general principles: luxuries are better buys than necessities and pleasure will be more profitable than pain. In love, it's time to mend fences and heal a rift. Be generous in victory! AQUARIUS Anyone who tells you that you're incompetent, inefficient and irresponsible is likely to be sent away with a flea in their ear. And quite right, too. Why should people pick on you just because you have your own way of doing things? There's one answer: none! READ | Asif Basra found hanging at Dharamshala residence 
TAURUS, Like it or not, you must pay much closer attention to partners' needs and wishes today. Ignore this advice and you may find yourself on the receiving end of some pretty sharp criticism over the next forty-eight hours. After all, some people see this as a time for plain speaking. 
GEMINI, Pursue your worldly ambitions with care and attention. Also, be aware that even though you're normally addicted to the facts, your hopes and dreams are dominated by a more imaginative sense of life's many possibilities than is usual. Time to broaden your horizons? I think so! CANCER The Moon is bound to reinforce your sense that life is a series of romantic possibilities to be followed and enjoyed. Extend your good feelings to lovers, children and younger relatives in general. And, if there has been any bad feeling, be the first to kiss and make-up. 
LEO, By all means continue to play the waiting game. Time is on your side and if you hold on now, then partners and professional associates will eventually come round to your distinctive way of thinking. The coming Sun-Moon alignment will make your future path clear. 
VIRGO, Even though you may feel that others are still being slightly inconsiderate, irresponsible or unprofessional, this is honestly only to be expected. Partly the blame must fall on your own exacting standards. But you must also realise that other people didn't perform as well as they might have done, either. 
LIBRA, You are not one to lose heart and give up the struggle unless it becomes abundantly clear that you are wasting your time. The only mistake you have made was to imagine that associates were more efficient than they really are. At this stage in the lunar cycle, anything is possible! 
SCORPIO, You often seem to do quite well at this time of year. Both romantic and family matters are thriving under the influence of helpful planets, and any slips may be the result of your own errors - or of various unexpected developments. And who can blame you for that? 
SAGITTARIUS, This is certainly a phase for travel. The root cause of current restless feelings involves your profound quest for the truth. Such deep considerations aside, the very least you can do is indulge your curiosity about new people, distant places and different cultures. 
CAPRICORN, There is a lot to be said for allowing things to cool down. Deal with those responsibilities you have already taken on, but generally try to minimise any commitments that are lurking on the horizon. And don't firm up financial agreements until you are certain. AQUARIUS A series of rather pleasant planetary aspects over the next few days should allow you to turn on the charm. If you have hard or unflattering things to say, you will deliver them in the sweetest way possible. But, then, that is you all over! You can persuade almost anyone to do almost anything! 
TAURUS, Now is the moment to stick to your principles. Your cautious, conservative plans are favoured: come out of the woodwork and claim your birthright as a traditionalist and don't let anyone persuade you that you need to break your favourite habits. By the way, this is also a perfect period for the young-at-heart. READ | Bihar election results: Defying exit polls, BJP-JD set to return, Chirag Paswan cuts their votes 
GEMINI, Professional decisions, whether taken by you or a partner, must combine a sense of what is necessary financially, together with an understanding of what will enable you to enhance the quality of your life. Start by building firm foundations: this is no time for fanciful dreamers. CANCER You have high principles, no doubt about that. The only question at the present time is whether you are prepared to make the necessary compromises and accept half a loaf rather than none. Actually, financial pressures build up as the days pass, with a major opportunity at the end of the week. READ | Pfizer Covid vaccine: Rollout logistics, potency likely speed bumps 
LEO, Comforting developments are due today, perhaps because there's a prevailing sense that security is a necessary attribute of the civilised lifestyle. You should receive some welcome reassurance before long. Until then, continue to do the right thing. 
VIRGO, Matters of a long-term financial or business nature must be set aside for a while, for a number of very good reasons. For a start, it is personal issues which count for more. And, secondly, it is a short-term gamble which is likely to do you most good. But your timing must be perfect! READ | Cream rises to the top: Mumbai Indians win IPL 2020 title 
LIBRA, There are sound astrological reasons why this is an opportune moment to sort out various personal affairs. For one thing, it seems pretty certain that partners will respond to your suggestions with understanding and sympathy and plenty of warmth. 
SCORPIO, The most prominent planet of the moment is Saturn, a serious celestial body which encourages you to explain yourself clearly, come to sensible decisions and put your ideas into practice. But how do you do this? By making as much effort as you possibly can! 
SAGITTARIUS, Although there's some movement at home, I feel that you're still in the planning stage as far as major long-term ventures are concerned. You've a little while to go yet before you can crank yourself into top gear. Glad to say, though, you should have a much more positive outlook very soon. READ | Why Apple making its own computer chips is a big deal 
CAPRICORN, Others' expectations of you are not always fair. Yet the question is; how should you respond to their demands? By ignoring them, perhaps? Maybe the best way forward is to put extra effort into your own favourite activities -and steer clear of unwanted confrontation. AQUARIUS What on earth is happening with your finances? The presence of that muddled sign, Pisces, certainly seems to be suggesting confusion and possibly one or two bad buys, yet something very wonderful may come out of current discussions. That has to be worth the wait. READ | Xi, Khan watching, Modi says SCO members must respect sovereignty 
TAURUS, The Moon's position today is not considered a classically advantageous one for Taureans, yet it could encourage you to put more effort into a close relationship. It could also enhance your delight in languid and harmonious conditions, especially at work. 
GEMINI, A crucial factor in your present affairs must be the location of Mercury, your normally astute planetary ruler, in a slightly muddled region. This is persuading you to ignore the facts and follow your intuition. On the plus side, though, you will soon have a chance to change your mind. CANCER Lunar alignments focus your attention on that most Cancerian of concerns, your home and family. This is one of those days when Jupiter, planet of goodwill, is bound to lift your spirits and raise your morale. It could also show you how to turn a mistake to your advantage! 
LEO, Nothing can really prevent you from making your point with colour and passion. A frank exchange of views is called for and you should not shirk the responsibility to lay your cards on the table. You need to put your material security first - just for a change. 
VIRGO, You have a well-deserved reputation for being an honest and reliable individual. However, over the coming days, it may be partners who can teach you a thing or two about the proper way to conduct yourself. Listen carefully, for you will learn more than you expected. 
LIBRA, Venus, the planet with special responsibility for your affections, is on your side. This is bound to cheer you up and induce you to look on the bright side. It is also encouraging you to check out practical details. You might even spot a way to close a financial loop-hole. 
SCORPIO, The time is fast approaching when you must cheer the domestic base or family home up a little. Venus and Mars are encouraging you to invite friends round and indulge in a spot of entertaining, much as part of the Scorpionic spirit resists such outgoing ventures. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon is approaching a powerful position in your solar chart, but it's not there yet. The only reasonable conclusion is that you must pay much greater attention to people at large, not just close friends, and take pains to ensure the quality of your presentation. 
CAPRICORN, Manners, as they say, maketh Man, not to mention Woman. As long as the Moon is in its present position, I am afraid you have little choice but to be scrupulous in your behaviour - and utterly charming. You have a rare ability to work out what other people are really thinking, and that should help you avoid a disagreement. AQUARIUS Your mood this evening may be quite sharply differentiated from the way you feel during the day. That's partly to do with the Sun's daily cycle. Perhaps something will happen around late afternoon to annoy or disturb you, or even to interest and stimulate you. 
TAURUS, If I may use a thoroughly Taurean metaphor, now is the time to take the Bull by the horns. In fact, even leisured Taureans must set about achieving their worldly ambitions with slightly more vigour than usual. If you don't get ahead of the game now, then partners will overtake you next week. 
GEMINI, You may have little choice but to relax this week. I realise that this may be difficult advice for some of you highly-strung Geminians to follow, but the fact is that you will get nowhere by confronting people or taking risks. Plus, you need to get partners on your side. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER Benevolent planets are all lined up with lucrative, if extravagant, regions of your solar chart. You must therefore turn your energies to the very simple matter of earning as much money as you can and then disposing of your gains as wisely as possible. 
LEO, An emotional tie has been going through a rather testing phase. However, Venus and Mars, the two planets of physical and emotional attraction, are ready to create the conditions for reconciliation. One gives you extra charm, the other enables you to figure out the details. 
VIRGO, It may not be entirely obvious, but your determination to have your own way in personal matters is succeeding. However, what you must ask is whether you truly want to force other people to accept your ways. If you know what's good for you, you'll turn up the charm. Follow US election results LIVE updates 
LIBRA, Venus is magnificently aligned with a number of serious planets, an excellent long-term indication for the Libran lifestyle, bringing emotional warmth, creative fulfilment and pleasures of the most cultured variety. But I have a feeling that it's your fantasies which count for most. 
SCORPIO, Mercury, ruling your mind, is still a deeply-helpful presence, encouraging you to view the world through your imaginative Scorpionic spectacles. Unfortunately, your unique vision is all too easily swamped by the rigours of daily existence. Perhaps you need to give yourself a little more space? 
SAGITTARIUS, Much of what has occurred recently, or happens now, may appear to have been designed with your special needs in mind. However, it may be your weaknesses as well as your strengths which are coming under scrutiny. You might have to get a good story ready. Follow Bihar elections LIVE updates 
CAPRICORN, There are still some bumpy moments — and you'll handle them just fine. The coming period should be relatively smooth, and you'll be free from many of the pressures of the recent past. That has to be good news — doesn't it? You should even have more space for a favourite hobby. AQUARIUS Changes are afoot on the home front and at work, and you need to be well- organised and consistent. Ideal conditions should help you gain from newly-formed social liaisons. You should also maximise any and all financial commitments without further delay. 
TAURUS, The Moon is rushing headlong through your chart, and the pace of events will speed up. When it finally reaches its destination, it will represent a massive inrush of energy into your emotional life - and your heart. Until then, you may put your feet up and look after yourself! 
GEMINI, You're still not prepared to talk about your most important proposals and plans. You should bear in mind, though, that next week may be very different, so have your story ready. Socially, your confidence is rising and you are prepared to meet new people. CANCER There's a long-distance dimension to your affairs, and overseas contacts definitely seem to be growing stronger. Either that, or someone who arrives from far away may come knocking at your door. The indications are complex. 
LEO, You've made your point, and made it well by all accounts. Now is the time to pursue your romantic dreams, especially if a new relationship is on the cards. But what really means the most to you is companionship, the sense that treasured friends will stick around. 
VIRGO, Confrontation is never far away, but there is no reason why you shouldn't have your say and stand up for yourself without arousing a partner's anger. A battle of principles seems likely, yet there is no cause worth risking your personal relationships for. 
LIBRA, From the planetary point of view your week is divided into neat compartments. Get trim and fit, work and do your chores up to Wednesday, and then change tack, devoting your time to love, romance and marital matters! 
SCORPIO, These are strange times indeed. You might blame the planets, but you should really take responsibility for unexpected twists of fate. A person, problem or memory you thought had been disposed of for good may soon pop up again without warning, although you might be pleasantly surprised. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sooner or later you need to call a halt to a course of action which is designed to please other people, but may not be right for you. It doesn't make any sense to keep slogging away at something that has lost any meaning or relevance. 
CAPRICORN, If you're true to your sign, only you know what needs to be done, how it is to be done and what the outcome must be. You need to trust your instincts, but without causing other people unnecessary irritation. As you know, it's all a matter of striking a careful balance. AQUARIUS You've done your work, and now you deserve a break. If you can soldier on until the end of the week, you will see that all the trouble was worth it. This is no moment to worry about letting someone down - it is high time they took responsibility for their own affairs. 
TAURUS, Opportunities for growth and progress frequently pass you by but, then, is there any reason why you should be forced to change? You'd do just as well to go for sheer pleasure and self-indulgence. After all, at this stage in the week's proceedings, I'm sure you could do with a break. 
GEMINI, You have been amazingly patient in the past and have allowed things to take their own course. But you must now buck your ideas up and see to it that you are in the driving seat. Financial developments are also helpfully aspected, as a matter of interest - so do your best. READ | US Election Results 2020 Live Updates: Joe Biden inches closer to victory CANCER It really doesn't matter whether your motives are financial and professional or purely personal. All that is important is that you recognise that you won't get very far if you try and go it alone. Teamwork is the key, and your generosity will get you everywhere. 
LEO, Today's misunderstandings may well be deliberate. It's possible that people will be determined to misread your intentions purely for the hell of it. Perhaps they just want to prove their independence. But what they don't realise is that you've got the edge at the moment. 
VIRGO, This does indeed look like a busy period. You may not have much time off over the weekend, but do bear in mind that there are ways to cut corners. A snappy financial move could find you well in pocket. But it's your inner, private values which require most attention. READ | Bihar Election 2020 Voting Live Updates: PM Modi urges citizens to ‘set new record' 
LIBRA, Family members are a mite touchy and much depends on your ability to take personal slights and rebuffs in your stride. If at all possible, do move ahead rapidly with potentially startling developments at home. And involve family members as much you can. 
SCORPIO, You will be happy to hear that not all your efforts have been in vain. One planetary aspect is dramatic and revolutionary, the other lively and irreverent. Clearly, this is no time for faint hearts. But, then, after all that has happened I think you understand perfectly well what is going on. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your lunar alignments, which are primarily responsible for shaping your day-to-day mood, are basically favourable. Social costs may be higher than expected, but if you're happy to splash out, I can see no particular problems. Past resentments should be just that - past. READ | To reopen schools or not? Some take leap, others hold back 
CAPRICORN, Obviously, it goes against the grain, but radical moves may be essential. I don't think you can afford to sit still any longer. Weekend or no, do spare a little thought for professional ambitions. Many of you are by now seeing the rewards for all your hard work. AQUARIUS Shopping trips and spending expeditions are at the top of the agenda, and those with a long-term perspective should check up on pensions and investments. A matter of principle, a legal question or an overseas matter may require immediate and urgent attention. READ | Kamal Haasan never gives up on the audience, despite their failure to truly appreciate him 
TAURUS, You should allow matters of an intensely personal nature to take their own course, as any mistimed intervention could introduce complications. Turn your attention to overseas contacts. But you'll also soon be looking inward, searching for the answers to life's many mysteries. 
GEMINI, With Mars currently pounding away through a deeply personal section of your solar chart, you may be under pressure to act, and act fast. If you resist, you'll begin to feel more uncomfortable, so accept what must be done and resolve to take the lead. CANCER It really is a moment for common sense. I don't think that anyone will have ideas to match yours when it comes to efficiency, organisation and practicality. Yet if family members are involved, you must take nothing, repeat nothing, for granted. 
LEO, As a rule, you should always jump in at the deep end and refuse to allow anyone to hold you back. You can expect radical initiatives at work, perhaps prompted by partners with unusual ideas. Also, do take quick steps to deal with any long-standing personal irritation - and try to find a peaceful path. 
VIRGO, You do tend by nature to keep a stiff upper lip and pretend that nothing is wrong. However, it may be a material problem, perhaps a financial matter, possibly something to do with a lover or child, which eventually forces you to face up to simmering discontent. 
LIBRA, There will almost certainly be a confrontation over domestic matters, but not necessarily a painful one. Indeed, you may relish the prospect of clearing the air and breaking free with one almighty bound. But even if you do get your own way, don't relax - at least not just yet. 
SCORPIO, Few people realise that behind your occasionally devious tendencies lies a profound desire to create universal peace and harmony. This noble ambition will be a very prominent motivation over the next four or five weeks, though colleagues may continue to misunderstand your motives. 
SAGITTARIUS, I know that you want to live a life that is more fulfilling and complete, but today you'll be reminded of the fact that much depends on what you can afford. Yet, above all, it's a time to develop and expand your unique creative gifts and skills. Why don't you show the world what you're made of? 
CAPRICORN, The celestial spotlight will be on you today. At work and at home others will be looking to you to take charge and sort things out. Family members are likely to expect you to seize the initiative, but you should only accept such responsibility if you're completely happy with it. AQUARIUS Your stars are at once increasingly devious and exceptionally idealistic. So why don't you minimise the former tendency and maximise the latter? Also, do pursue any private spiritual interests, whatever people say. You see this is a time to broaden your horizons in all directions. 
TAURUS, The past few months seem to have been physically and mentally taxing, but you must admit that you have a great deal going for you. It's difficult, though, to cope with partners' emotional intensity. Probably your best approach is to listen, learn and give the best advice you can. 
GEMINI, Mars, the planet which indicates the ups and downs in your energy, is strong, but not too strong, which suggests that you may either explode with anger or turn the other cheek. I am not saying that one course of action is right and the other wrong, but you must be prepared for the consequences of whichever path you choose. CANCER You will soon consider the advantages of moving home. However, I suspect the ultimate conclusion will be that it is better to stay where you are and make various important improvements. If you've been conjuring up financial dreams, you'll soon be beginning to put them into practice. 
LEO, So many areas in your chart are denoting imminent upheaval that you may find it difficult to believe that any change has positive consequences. But the fact is that you may need to give up something small, in order to gain something big. The future, after all, is up for grabs. 
VIRGO, By all means continue to put your ideas forward. It looks pretty certain that most people will accept what you have to say at face value, but others will be unable to keep up. Just a word about romantic prospects: these are excellent. Mind you, the temperature is due to rise over the next few days. 
LIBRA, A new opening or offer may not be finalised until another few weeks have passed, but I can promise you that a phase of uncertainty will be coming to an end over the next three months. Indeed, when the answers do come, you may be pleasantly surprised. 
SCORPIO, I know that you may have been obliged to go over a lot of old ground, but in truth this is a period to focus on the future. Jupiter, you see, is a planet which has no truck with the ties and restraints of the past, and now it is working its magic in your home and family life. 
SAGITTARIUS, Calm down and don't make too much of a song and dance if monetary matters are becoming complicated. A sudden move today may run into the sand tomorrow, but then perhaps you'll get going again on the day after. Impulse buys are probably best - or at least the most enjoyable! 
CAPRICORN, I don't think you could ever be totally prepared for some of the upheavals which are scheduled for the next three weeks. However, you should now have a chance to re-evaluate some of the personal benefits of past disturbances, and in no time you'll work out how to deal with fresh challenges. AQUARIUS If that splendid planet Jupiter is having the desired effect, you should now be able to detect more than a ray of hope in at least one special relationship. Don't turn your back on someone special, even if he, or she, has behaved badly. After all to err is human, to forgive divine. 
TAURUS, The Moon's impact in a financial sector of your horoscope maintains the feeling that money is the most important consideration. However, this materialistic mood is purely temporary and, by tomorrow, you'll realise that life does indeed have a deeper purpose. 
GEMINI, Your personal life is in danger of being turned upside down. But perhaps danger is not the right word, for many of you are ready for a change. If you know what's good for you, you'll welcome a friendly argument. You might also begin to plan domestic improvements. CANCER Over the past few weeks, you appear to have veered between boredom and excessive activity, such is the way of the planet Mars. If someone close has tried to teach you a lesson or point out the error of your ways, I hope you have listened very carefully to their wise words. 
LEO, A number of interesting planetary formations now relate to joint financial arrangements and business affairs. I hope you don't feel that someone in the past has let you down, because it doesn't look as if any wrong was intended. You can probably join together with like-minded people to correct past mistakes. 
VIRGO, There's no doubt that the past few weeks have represented a turning point in your social attitudes. Eventually, I think you will see that your needs and expectations regarding intimate relationships have gone through a valuable sea-change. That's all part of being a modern Virgo! 
LIBRA, (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23 Although you have a reputation for being generous, you may decide that enough is enough. It's not that anyone has been exploiting you recently, but the cumulative feeling that you've been taken for granted is about to become too great to bear. 
SCORPIO, Why don't you relax your efforts and allow others to do a bit of graft? Mercury's approaching relationship to Pluto singles you out as the master planner, and it's right that other people should do what they are told. It could be a couple of weeks before you find out whether they agree! 
SAGITTARIUS, It is a pleasure to be able to report that the overwhelming impact of your solar alignments, and hence of the circumstances in which you find yourself, is auspicious. May I urge you not to squander your advantage by being over-emotional and impulsive, or by taking partners for granted. 
CAPRICORN, If the stars have the measure of you today, they'll encourage you to hide away and keep yourself to yourself. Your privacy is an overwhelming priority and I don't think you'll take to people who presume too much. It's a day which favours poetry over practical tasks. AQUARIUS I often sense that one of your major problems is a deep lack of self-confidence but, if all goes according to plan, colleagues could be astounded by your new-found breadth of vision, optimism and self-assurance. And over the next two weeks, you'll be asserting your independence yet again. 
TAURUS, Short as well as long-term cycles emphasise financial conditions. From pensions and major procurements down to minor points of monetary etiquette, you must keep a very close eye on your cash-flow. However, that's only part of the picture on a day which sees massive changes in mood. 
GEMINI, Don't worry about being passed by or passed over. Nobody with any sensitivity can ignore someone like you for very long. Only a mix of the weird and wonderful with the utterly down-to-earth and ordinary, will satisfy you from now until the end of the year. 
LEO, Lunar alignments maintain a benevolent sway over your earthly affairs. If the evidence is to be believed, the Moon's current alignment should benefit your material resources as well as your mind and emotions. You might find that difficult to believe, today! 
VIRGO, The Moon is undoubtedly contributing to a spot of background tension, but then there would be no change without challenge, would there? Take a fresh look at various domestic assumptions and family agreements which may have gone unquestioned for too long. Follow US elections live updates 
LIBRA, There still seems to be a lot, perhaps too much, going on behind the scenes. The planets show little indication of any threat, so we can hopefully discount the possibility of conspiracies and plots. Instead we may expect selfless, charitable endeavours to flourish. 
SCORPIO, It's not often you have a time as packed with punchy, planetary alignments as over the next two weeks. What is at stake is your freedom of movement and your ability to change your life and circumstances as you see fit. It's all a question of how far you are prepared to curb your wilder instincts! 
SAGITTARIUS, Symbolically speaking the Moon is under your control today. This means that as far as home and family affairs are concerned, you may receive the credit, but you can't escape your obligations to children and loved ones. It also, by the way, means that partners may have to come first. Also Read | Jharkhand scam: Fraud went on unchecked even as red flags were waved 
CAPRICORN, In the ancient art of political astrology, the Sun is the symbol of the reigning monarch. The fact that this brilliant star is traversing a prosperous and colourful region of your horoscope means that you must now aim for the very top or miss a grand opportunity. AQUARIUS Don't feel left out. There'll be time enough soon to strut around in the limelight and, in the meantime, you might be advised to take advantage of each and every chance to put your feet up. The only problem is that, first of all, you have to explain why you're not prepared to continue with your commitments! 
TAURUS, I'd like to take a quick look at a long-term cycle and point out that Mars, a most impetuous planet, is making this rather an extravagant time. If your costs haven't escalated already, they soon will! Your job is to make sure that it's all worth it. 
GEMINI, Let's check out Mercury, the planet responsible for your chatty ways. Right now you are being urged to do something practical with your ideas and, if you don't take that important step towards a new activity soon, you could become rather frustrated or resentful. CANCER I often think that yours is one of the most perfect signs of the zodiac, but so often your life seems to be full of struggles. Yet, looking at the long-term, it is now a simple matter to forecast increased prosperity and comfort - but only if you dodge the next few days' worth of emotional flying bombs. 
LEO, The weekly trend shows that you should now begin to bring financial plans to a conclusion. If you've been dreaming about a particular investment or bargain but have made no positive moves, get on with it. But more than that, you're heading for a fresh start in whatever area you choose. 
VIRGO, Venus and Mercury are still closely related, encouraging everything that is most sociable and charming in your character. However, it now seems that unless you take the initiative, one possibility, perhaps a promised partnership, may slip from your grasp. 
LIBRA, This is now a special time of year. I cannot promise that the next four weeks will be easy but, even in small ways, they will be significant. In fact, in a strange sense, the more obstacles you meet, the greater your chances for success. The acorns which fall now will, as the saying goes, grow into mighty oaks as the years go by. 
SCORPIO, Strangely enough, contradictory planetary influences often make for the most productive periods. The fact that you are entering a secretive period, while still going through a sociable phase, is therefore likely to lead to some highly intriguing encounters over the next two or three weeks. 
SAGITTARIUS, Professional arrangements still seem to dominate the outlook. If you've been having one or two sleepless nights, something is definitely wrong. The underlying trend for all worldly ambitions is actually profoundly favourable. You just have to get through the next few days with your dreams and plans intact! 
CAPRICORN, As from now you are entering an ambitious phase that will see professional types redoubling their efforts to get on and get ahead. There seems to be a chance coming up soon to play some sort of diplomatic role in your community. Just how and when is up to you and your sense of timing. AQUARIUS You must soon be the lucky recipient of a windfall, although I don't think you're going to be showered by cash from heaven. It might be that money is not involved, but that you'll be swamped with affection. The source of the upcoming generosity should be someone who is well-known to you. 
TAURUS, I hope you're making a fresh start, because that's precisely what the current lunar alignment indicates. At work, at home, in money and in love, you need to abandon habits which are out of date and behind the times. 
GEMINI, Please don't sit around while the world passes you by. Now is the time to develop the maximum potential of your horoscope, bringing forth new ideas and showing that you are in fact a genius! You have much to teach the rest of us about how to live in harmony with ourselves! CANCER Your social stars speak of romance and passion. What could be better? If you don't enjoy yourself this week you will have missed a massive opportunity to relax and let your hair down! And you can't be sure when the same chances will come around again. 
LEO, There is so much going on behind the scenes that you may feel a little confused as to who you are and what, exactly, other people expect of you. You could try asking them what they think, although there's no guarantee that you'll get a straight answer. 
VIRGO, According to the very best celestial indications, you should now have made your final arrangements for travelling or initiating a major adventurous ambition, or for developing any foreign contacts. Your social stars are also looking brighter than for many a day. 
LIBRA, You have one week left to resolve one particular financial hassle, so no messing around, please. In the romantic department, it now seems pretty clear that status is the most important thing on your mind. Also, set your sights on friends who have earned respect and admiration. 
SCORPIO, By now you should have seen the required changes in your close partnerships, including the necessary arrivals and departures. Emotionally speaking, a change is as good as a rest. Let's see you putting your feet up and making personal indulgence a higher priority than routine chores. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may deal with close partnerships early in the week and sort out any sources of discontent before they go any further. Then, and only then, will you be absolutely free to deal with joint finances and sundry investments. Do be sure to have an adventurous weekend. 
CAPRICORN, The celestial spheres are sliding into a positive position, and your personal constellations are assuming a pattern of supreme adventurousness, not to mention romantic exploration. You may expect only the best from other people. AQUARIUS Saturn is your favourite planet at the moment. This particular celestial body is the bringer of self-discipline and tradition, so these are the qualities which you must cultivate. The time for rebellion is past - and now you must deliver the goods! 
TAURUS, Letting go is never easy. However, if you do what you know to be right in the long-term, even if this means going against current desires, you'll free yourself from a series of awkward dilemmas. You need to be able to stand aside and see your ambitions through critical eyes. READ | Bihar elections: His base shrinking, Nitish hopes voter cheering Modi will carry him along 
GEMINI, You'll probably be at full stretch emotionally. The immediate areas of concern involve your social life, children and money, in each of which you should work for the best while sensibly guarding against disappointment. And, if you're too busy, then heed the lessons - and be more discriminating in future. CANCER This is a positive time and you'll soon be hitting a peak on a number of cycles. The key to success is to do everything with total and absolute concentration. If someone tries to distract you, ignore them! You can ask the experts but, then, in some senses you're an expert too. 
LEO, This is certain to be a time of arguments and hassles. If it's not, you're missing out! The point is that if you are prepared to risk disagreements you'll clear the air and do yourself a power of good. Honesty can be uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean that it's not necessary. READ | Divisive forces who questioned Pulwama attack have been exposed: PM Modi 
VIRGO, You'll be on twenty-four hour call, clearing up partners' emotional, professional and personal crises. Don't worry if friends seem too critical - it's just their way. Besides, there might be some good common sense in their sharp words. Listen well. 
LIBRA, The overall situation is still potentially profoundly chaotic, but even in the midst of disorder there is much to be thankful for. Plus, an older friend might come to the rescue before long. This simple fact is due to transform your life over the coming few months. 
SCORPIO, Estrangements, either by design or accident, are likely. But then, so are sudden and intense new meetings. In fact, anyone you meet now is likely to arouse extremely strong reactions, although whether of attraction or repulsion, only time will tell! 
SAGITTARIUS, You may be thrown into fresh uncertainty. The question is how you deal with it. Right now you may be advised to put your fantasies into action, no matter how many times you've been told that you're not up to it. All you need is the right support from the best people. READ | Funny Boy trailer: This Deepa Mehta film is a story of acceptance, love and inclusion 
CAPRICORN, You may have to face the world head-on today. You cannot make difficult people or situations go away by ignoring them, so you may as well get into the spirit of the times: fact is indeed a great deal stranger than fiction. But then, what's new? AQUARIUS Secret developments may be brought into the open if you ask the right questions. It is doubtful whether you will ever build up a full picture of what is going on at the moment, but at least you can fit some pieces into the jigsaw. A little fancy foot-work should help. READ | Kajal Aggarwal gets married to Gautam Kitchlu. See pictures 
TAURUS, There are two answers to a current question - ‘yes or no'! The moment you consider 'maybe' as a possible option, you may relieve the emotional tension, but you'll also miss the chance for a truly staggering and intense encounter. In the final analysis, it's up to you. 
GEMINI, A financial shock is a possibility, although there is no indication that it need be unpleasant. Indeed, if you are ready for some fancy footwork you can turn a likely deficit into a handsome profit. You might even earn brownie points in a close relationship. CANCER You must have all your wits about you. It is awfully tempting to imagine that you can get what you want merely by shouting louder than anyone else. It would be better to be very careful, considerate and sympathetic to others. And that means that you might have to put your own interests second. 
LEO, It's a sensitive day, perhaps too sensitive. Too many people are liable to take offence where none is intended, and you should therefore watch what you say. You may continue to do your bit for a charitable cause, contributing to the general welfare. Good for you. 
VIRGO, If you have any doubts or questions, listen to partners. Even though they may speak in riddles, there is a sort of sense in what they have to say. You may forget the facts and look for the inner meaning, if only to give yourself time to sort out what you want. 
LIBRA, You may expend a great deal of effort trying to keep the peace, but at times like this you may be right to give up and allow people and situations to swing to extremes. Only then will you discover whether other people's promises can be really be trusted. 
SCORPIO, Your beliefs, thoughts and feelings seem to be coming together. In love you are extremely highly-motivated, and likely to get exactly what you want. Travel, both long-distance and close at hand, could provide the trigger which changes your life. 
SAGITTARIUS, You must come to terms with enforced changes. You should also realise that you have steered yourself into a situation which now seems to be out of your control. But simple logic dictates that if you got yourself in, you can get yourself out. So get on with it! 
CAPRICORN, It wouldn't take much for you to throw in the towel, and nobody would blame you. However, if you are typical of your sign, you'll do the right thing and persist. Once you're through current uncertainty you'll see that the effort was worth it. AQUARIUS Domestic and family expenditure may add to your cares, but in general a bout of extravagance offers you a way of forgetting life's burdens. Travel is also still looking like a good means of escape. But it might be an emotional journey you're embarking on, rather than a physical one. 
TAURUS, Let's face it, you're not inclined to compromise if you're not in the wrong. You can be courteous, sensitive and willing to help some of the time, but sometimes other people have to recognise that they can't sit on you without facing the consequences! Mind you, you do need to consider other people's feelings. 
GEMINI, The most positive area of your life should be work, even though there is a serious danger of emotional explosions. You may also be inclined to worry about your physical fitness and energy levels, in which case you should seek reassurance - and get the best advice. CANCER A series of planets places the spotlight clearly on passion, adventure and romance. The conclusion seems to be fairly clear: everything that happens will be reflected through your deep-seated desire for emotional ecstasy. That's the theory. The real outcome might be different! 
LEO, It's difficult to see whether you will be vowing to leave home, evict a partner or merely spend your time shifting the furniture around. One way or another, you should indulge the pressure for emotional change. And confide in the people who understand you! 
VIRGO, You may devote whatever spare time you have to making sure that, even if a partnership is coming to an end, at least you have your memories. On a purely material level, you may allow financial and business plans to drift, unless you're facing an immovable deadline. 
LIBRA, Your daily stars indicate the need to get on with work, but your weekly and monthly cycles reveal that this may be well-nigh impossible. Life, as usual, is complicated. Your colleagues, partners and loved ones are all likely to create an emergency which throws you off course. 
SCORPIO, One of your major strengths is your ability to stick to a particular course of action. Some people call it stubbornness but, at the moment, it's what you need if you're to achieve your romantic goal. And if other people laugh at your dreams, that's their problem! 
SAGITTARIUS, You are bound to be irritated by a close friend or relation, whether you get what you want or not. You'll be troubled by the thought that the grass is greener on the other side, convinced that a partner is having an easy ride. But the truth is that you might have got the best of a deal. Be a bit more tolerant! 
CAPRICORN, You may take decisions and hold discussions. It's important to have an exchange of views, because there's a slim chance that a little intelligent dialogue could help break through the day's general emotional turmoil. All you have to do is make the effort! AQUARIUS You must know that you are secure, and in this knowledge you can afford to take a few risks here and there. At work the positive angle is provided by the possibility that old wounds may now be healed. Build bridges, mend fences, and make the world a better place. 
TAURUS, This is far from a straightforward period for either partnership or romantic matters. However, if you tackle your desires head on, you'll realise that it's all really very simple! Mind you, tomorrow you might come to a completely different conclusion. 
GEMINI, One by one, the planets are pressurising different areas of your chart, incurring new responsibilities as they do so. If you are about to be overwhelmed by fresh emotions, hang on. New facts are on the way which will radically alter your opinions. CANCER You should never compromise over matters of detail. That's an absolute law. However, the personal details may be bent, twisted or completely dropped. What is important is your long-term goal, not your short-term strategy. And then there's the simple matter of getting on with the people you depend on! 
LEO, Life is looking profoundly unsettled, but you may be encouraged by secret hopes and aspirations. Get these in perspective and make sure that, for your own part, you act only with the highest of motives. If you take the right actions, you'll soon see that you receive the best reactions. 
VIRGO, It's a day for reckless gestures and impulse buys. It's up to you whether you wish to enjoy this rather stormy 'planetary weather' to the full, or if you want to dig your heels in and stick to what you know. And a word of warning - if you're not careful you might spend a lot of time clearing up after other people! 
LIBRA, What life has given you recently may not have been exactly what you expected or hoped for, but that's because you were being unrealistic. If you wish, you may now go back to first principles and start again. That could actually be an exciting thing to do. 
SCORPIO, If you're confused, it might all be for the best. This is a moment of change, and the planets are stirring up fresh possibilities, creating additional choices. For your own good, you may offer intense commitment to others, showing that you can be relied on - and deserve their trust. 
SAGITTARIUS, Partners' problems shouldn't bother you, for your own desires must be satisfied first. Your hopes and feelings can be so intense, so powerful, that nothing else really matters. Cash questions could be solved very soon, although there really doesn't seem to be any final answer. 
CAPRICORN, A formidable array of planets is conspiring to alter the means by which you earn your living and use your resources. Look behind the scenes and you'll see that there are also moves to rearrange your profession, update your ambitions and change your friends. AQUARIUS You need permanence and security. You may now be confronted with the need to accept that, on a cosmic level, nothing can ever be secure for ever, but at least a loved one will reassure you that everything is fine for now! Perhaps, though, it's trust you need, rather than reassurance. 
TAURUS, It's more than likely that career worries could be out of place. Your concerns seem to be based around doubts as to whether you can handle prospective responsibilities. All you have to do is believe in yourself. After all, if you have faith in your own powers you'll exude confidence and attract others.

GEMINI, You are really perfectly justified in feeling quietly optimistic about the future, but make sure that your confidence is firmly founded in plans which are practical as well as original. The best way forward is to concentrate on increasing your skills. CANCER There are many indications as to what the combined influence of friends' and family members' demands will be on your private life. The problem is that there are too many! The advantage is that so many doors are now set to open that you can pick and choose. 
LEO, It still seems somewhat inevitable that you'll have to put others' interests first. There's no reason why this shouldn't be thoroughly enjoyable, if only because it gives you a chance to relax a little. Frankly, you could do with a change of scene! READ | Explained: The plasma therapy debate 
VIRGO, Your classic qualities of self-sacrifice and service to humanity are straining for recognition. It's important to draw a line between being genuinely helpful to others and allowing them to unfairly exploit you. It's all a matter of being fair - but firm. 
LIBRA, There's more than one powerful lunar alignment around the corner, and if you want to prepare for the coming upheaval now, press ahead with all personal plans. Arrange romantic encounters, finalise social ambitions and get your priorities in order. READ | India vs Australia: Survival of the fittest 
SCORPIO, It's time for optimism - and there's no point in worrying that the worst will happen. An unusual amount of helpful planetary activity in your chart gives you every reason to believe that at last your hopes and wishes will be granted. You may put your family first and everything else second. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should have little trouble making the most of the positive trends that are helping to revitalise your life at the moment. You may talk to others, especially people you live with, about your feelings, and deal with all those feelings of frustration at home. 
CAPRICORN, It's difficult to know just what to do for the best. Personal and family affairs are still soaking up too much of your valuable resources. It's all a question of being disciplined and knowing when to say ‘no', including when to say it to yourself! READ | Male govt employees who are single parents can now take child care leave: MoS Jitendra Singh AQUARIUS You still seem to be firmly in the driving seat, and today is an ideal moment to implement sweeping changes at home, hopefully while other people are looking the opposite way. You should care for partners' interests as best you can, especially if they have been good to you in the past. 
TAURUS, You could be walking a romantic tightrope, and others are bound to challenge your habits and preconceptions. But even in the most awkward moments, please try to realise that they are only acting for the best. People who are out only to help themselves will gain nothing in the long run. 
GEMINI, If you should feel that the short-term advantage is slipping away from you, don't worry, for the long-term position is looking just fine. In particular you can look forward to improvements in relationships with children - but you might have to take the lead. CANCER You'll be caught on the horns of a dilemma; not exactly sure of how far current changes should go. Start by considering which domestic improvements should be at the top of your list, and persuade a partner you're right. And if they don't listen, try again! 
LEO, You are used to people standing in your way, and when you entered on your current domestic path, no one pretended that everything would be easy. In many respects, though, a partner's awkward behaviour will do you a good turn! You might even work out just where you stand on a particular problem. 
VIRGO, One cycle of opportunity is now almost over, and it's up to you to assess if the chances you've had have been to your liking and, therefore, whether you wish to continue to pursue them. Plus, remember, nature abhors a vacuum, so when one phase comes to an end, another must begin. 
LIBRA, Your financial situation is looking more and more complicated. There's little in the stars to indicate whether you're heading for a small loss or a major profit, but it will help to keep your feelings under control. You don't want to risk embarrassment, now, do you? 
SCORPIO, This week certain circumstances seem to be united in pushing you towards a passionate explosion, so don't be surprised if you begin to feel confused. Still, there's lots to get on with and you'll feel happier if you make an early start, no matter what you're doing. 
SAGITTARIUS, You must get on with your own affairs and avoid trying to run someone else's life. Above all, it's a day for putting your plans into action, and if you are content to do no more than fantasise, you'll end up nowhere! 
CAPRICORN, Domestic necessities represent the most urgent demand on your funds, so if you have any other spending plans you must make extra cash available. Even at home, peace can be bought by a simple matter of bribing your relations. That might be manipulative - but it could also be necessary! AQUARIUS You may put your foot down at home. You could be a little unsteady emotionally, but you know what you want, and you know how to get it. At work you may now begin to plan your next step, but you can, perhaps, take your time. If you make a premature judgement you might have to change it later. 
TAURUS, That energetic planet Mars is in a particularly businesslike mood, giving you a much-needed shot in the arm. The most pleasant result of your current celestial patterns should be a relaxation in various annoying suspicions or resentments, but that's mainly because you're finally on top of the facts.

GEMINI, Your social costs are set to spiral, although you shouldn't begrudge spending money on your friends. As far as your intimate relationships are concerned, it's a time for passion. Let your feelings run high and leave loved ones in no doubt as to how you feel about them. CANCER It must be clear that recent personal developments can't fail to strengthen emotional ties and attachments. The price, though, may be the need to voluntarily free yourself from people who are quite obviously no good for you anymore. It may take some courage to say what you really think. 
LEO, Sober conditions are scheduled to continue for all you fun-loving Leos. You'll have to exert a great deal of effort but may find that putting yourself out on behalf of loved ones and family members is a thankless task. Don't worry - your rewards will come when the time is right. READ | Bihar elections: What stands between Nitish Kumar and a possible fourth term? 
VIRGO, Any adverse or challenging aspects could do you a great deal of good. You certainly cannot afford to make rash moves but, if you are kind, considerate and cautious, you'll find that weekend stars smile on you. New friends will open the way to new and fascinating experiences. 
LIBRA, Your Libran sense of humour is one of your most wonderful assets. Take advice from friends, loved ones and close family members. Only then will you realise that the best way to deal with domestic upheavals is to laugh. Actually, a number of regions of your chart indicate that you will be growing more light-hearted, and that has to be good news. 
SCORPIO, Try to finalise all personal agreements while your ideas are still fresh. You see, Mercury, the planet of communication, is soon to move into a new sector of your chart, bringing an entirely fresh set of personal priorities and obliging you to tie up all loose ends. READ | US Elections 2020: Indian-Americans are grappling with the racial system like never before 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon will be aligned with a region of your horoscope which is exclusively connected to your intimate private affairs. Events which bother you may therefore have little relevance for anyone else. Wednesday and Thursday should be best for all family affairs, so plan accordingly. 
CAPRICORN, A rather disturbing period is coming to an end and within a few weeks you will have recovered your equilibrium. You are moving through an extremely important phase of your life and even minor developments may have remarkable significance in the long run. AQUARIUS You still seem to be hankering after something from long ago. Nostalgia is all very well, and sentimentality is sometimes to be encouraged, but don't lose sight of the fact that the past is gone and that the future is bearing down on you very rapidly. READ | As more women run marathons, they are fast closing gender gap 
TAURUS, Venus, the planet which represents your relationships, is now forming a distant alliance with Jupiter, the symbol of generosity. Could a lover be in a particularly generous mood? This is certainly one possibility. At all times remember that change is desirable, but stability is essential. READ | Once Nitish bastion, women ask tough questions: govt distanced from poor 
GEMINI, It's time to contemplate the professional future, although it is uncertain whether it is you or a partner who is under the spotlight. Plus, don't imagine that career is everything. There are many other ambitions worth pursuing! Improvements at home are long overdue, so put your suggestions forward now. CANCER Travel plans should form a central part of your thinking right now. Your need to get away is not pure escapism, more a matter of finding out what the rest of the world has to offer. Even short trips are likely to satisfy your expectations, at least partially. 
LEO, There's passion aplenty in the air today, and you're liable to be extremely busy. And if you don't like that prospect, then stay away from the action! Once you have dealt with financial questions and routine chores, you can turn to personal relationships. Take differences of opinion in your stride. READ | Bluetooth tracker for terror attacks finds new use in pandemic time — at the IPL 
VIRGO, The Moon presents you with significant personal challenges, and quite possibly a degree of confusion. The way to highlight today's positive potential is to emphasise every activity which is inspired, imaginative and romantic. That sounds like an excellent policy! 
LIBRA, Venus is currently bringing emotional reassurance, but its intriguing relationship with Mars could upset a number of your preconceptions today. It's important not to hang on to the past, but to see that people who have come into your life recently can offer you all the support you need. 
SCORPIO, You could be having qualms about one particular emotional tie, and you may be concerned that a partner or colleague doesn't feel about you the way you feel about them. It's one of those rare moments when absolute honesty is called for. You never know - you might be pleasantly surprised. READ | Explained: What determines onion prices 
SAGITTARIUS, You probably feel pulled in two directions, and you may imagine that there can be no solution to an emotional quandary. However, all things must pass, and if you face up to the issues now, the tension will dissipate. All you need is a dose of additional confidence. 
CAPRICORN, It is time for a little sensitivity. You may even have a telepathic feeling or two, and your intuitions certainly seem to be functioning in top gear. Mind you, it could be difficult to distinguish true facts from vague fantasies, and news which arrives very soon could be a mite confusing. AQUARIUS There may be little you can do to straighten out personal finances at the moment, but you must pay very close attention indeed to all joint business affairs. This is where prosperity lies. Could a loved one offer better advice than the experts? Perhaps - so listen well and judge carefully. READ | Borat Subsequent Moviefilm movie review: An audacious, riotously funny sequel 
TAURUS, Powerful social stars insist that love affairs be pursued in a constructive manner. It's time to be precise about what you're going to do, when you're doing it, and who you're doing it with. Punctuality is everything, and sheer efficiency could win the day. 
GEMINI, Mars, symbol of self-assertion and all high-energy activities, is moving on so, from now, you will have to stand on your own two feet. The positive angle is that you're approaching a phase in your life which should be a little more relaxed, but perhaps not until next week! CANCER This is a time for inspiration, and no doubt you'll be coming up with lots of bright plans for the future. If at all possible, do give other people time to catch up! Devote a little effort to making your nest more luxurious. Frankly, you deserve a little more comfort. 
LEO, There's no getting away from the fact that financial queries and concerns underpin everything, and that you won't get anywhere unless you deal with them first. I mean, what good are dreams if you can't pay for them? Also, question a partner on their real motives. 
VIRGO, You're at a minor monthly crossroads, and the best advice now is to carry on as you are, but be ready to make a 180-degree turn at any moment. Your stars are in a very powerful mood, but when events move fast you will have to decide which way to jump. 
LIBRA, It's time to consider your physical well-being again, checking up on matters like diet and exercise and getting in shape for the future. Work will be building up over the next month, and it will be important to pace yourself, finding relaxation when and where you can. 
SCORPIO, Your stars are looking highly sociable and increasingly passionate. It seems certain that your moods will be dominated by how well you get on with other people, and what you imagine they think of you. But there's really no need to be too self-conscious. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is your monthly make-or-break time both at home and at work. Short-term forecasts don't come much more dramatic than that, but the point is that you may now rearrange almost anything that doesn't please you, making sure that in future it does! 
CAPRICORN, You should by now have learnt to treasure your imagination. You see, at times like this, your success in virtually any venture depends on your almost poetic ability to charm other people and persuade them that you're right. That really is a skill to treasure. AQUARIUS For some reason your self-esteem seems to keep slipping, but today is one of those times when you can take steps to lift your morale. You may even realise just what it is that has been damaging your confidence. Was it another person? Perhaps you also played your part. 
TAURUS, Taurus: From now on, and for the rest of the week, you can afford to be a little more laid back. Wherever possible, introduce a touch of the manyana spirit, and put off as much as you can until tomorrow. Even that might be a little too hurried for some of you! 
GEMINI, Gemini: The fact that conditions at work are changing is confusing, but home affairs are still most important. Press ahead with all major schemes; the more outrageous and grandiose they are, the better, at least in theory! Perhaps you should get friends on your side before you really set out to shock. CANCER Cancer: There is a great deal to be gained from talking to as many people as possible as much as you can. At the moment, you have no way of judging who is going to come up with the best advice, so go fishing! If you talk to enough people about all your plans, then you might find out who really thinks like you. 
LEO, Leo: Certain events associated with recent Saturn patterns suggest that you might imagine you are trapped in circumstances not of your making. However, if you do feel 'stuck' emotionally, it may be through a situation which you have engineered, albeit unconsciously. In that case, the solution lies in your hands! 
VIRGO, Virgo: You're approaching an important moment of the year, with a turning point in your personal affairs. If you spend as much time as possible on routine matters now, you'll be able to deal with partnerships later on. That's no more than loyal companions deserve. 
LIBRA, Libra: Life could become busier as the day progresses. This may be because other people are expecting you to clear up after them. Just watch out that you don't stretch yourself so much that you end up flat on your back. You'll be no use to anyone if your energy reserves plummet. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: If there are any outstanding matters at home, or concerning family relationships, be sure to sort them out as soon as you can, otherwise events may move out of your control. Spare some time for sheer pleasure, though, remembering you were put on this planet to enjoy yourself. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: If you're wondering how home and professional affairs can be reconciled, you're already on the right track! The point is that only when you have asked the right questions, will you be able to find the answers. Besides, it's important that you realise that you don't know it all! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: A change of mood should reassure you about financial questions, even if you don't receive any final answers. There is also much to be said for bringing people together who have been apart for too long. You could play the peace-maker or the match-maker, to great applause. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Quite simply, if you want to get the best out of a financial deal, you've got to get your facts straight. There's no point in rushing ahead if you've overlooked certain fundamental details. In matters of the heart there is a continuing need to get in touch with loved ones overseas. 
TAURUS, Artistic types will find much to stimulate their imaginations this week - and that includes most of you. Work pressures will soon pass and there'll be opportunities to repay favours and complete non-essential tasks. Plus, a family member is about to apologise. What could be better? Horoscope Today, 22 October 2020 
GEMINI, You stand a reasonable chance of reaching an amicable conclusion to a number of personal disputes. There is still much to be said at work before you can be sure where you stand, and the rapidly approaching lunar drama will help you along: and about time, too. CANCER Don't make the mistake of equating emotional stability with financial security. The two are quite separate, and although it is often difficult to work out a plan of action in each, that is precisely what you must do now. Perhaps more experienced friends can help. 
LEO, Just to look ahead, your mood is about to become quite self-sacrificing. It seems as if you may become involved in a charitable venture of some sort, and today there could be indications of what is to come. But then, at the moment, every day brings pointers to the future. 
VIRGO, You should spend as much time as is necessary dealing with routine chores, and leave no stone unturned. You can rest assured that the more you accomplish today, the more time you'll have to deal with personal developments when the moment comes. 
LIBRA, You have a great deal on your mind, but that's not the point. You also have many opportunities to get out and enjoy yourself. Please realise that there's nothing wrong with a touch of escapism now and then! Other people might expect you to stand and fight - but they might be wrong. 
SCORPIO, Domestic affairs certainly require some close attention today, and it will pay to be businesslike. There is little to be gained from being sentimental, or by allowing your heart to over-rule your head. People you live with need their orders - and you might be the person to give them! 
SAGITTARIUS, You've done well, there's no doubt about that, even though your critics might not agree. You certainly have much to live up to, but don't be too hard on yourself. Other people will step in and lend a hand, but it's up to you to make the first move: if you don't ask, you won't get! 
CAPRICORN, This is a good time to remember that sometimes life can be managed in line with timeless ethical and religious truths. Adopt the moral high ground, but don't insist that others share your beliefs. What pays, at the moment, is a little extra tolerance. AQUARIUS New investment possibilities are in the air, but there may be less of a sense of urgency than recently. There's no reason why you shouldn't cut down on work and have an easy day - unless you've commitments you can't avoid. It's all a question of finding the right balance. 
TAURUS, Your stars are generally favourable and it's unlikely that you'll be pushed in any one single direction. Be positive and colleagues and employers will be more likely to see your point of view and offer assistance. But listen carefully to partners - or they'll hold it against you. 
GEMINI, Domestic plans are now becoming urgent, and it's clear that there are one or two vital improvements to make. You may, however, be feeling over-burdened by your obligations, so do your best to shift the backlog now. Hard work will win respect - as you know! CANCER The Sun merges with positive planets in a delightful manner, and will slowly but surely have a healing effect on partnerships which have suffered in the past. Romance will be stirring deep in your sensitive soul, so I hope that other people will be in a similar mood. 
LEO, Once again, the Moon issues an emotional challenge, so other people's interests will come first. You have so far only glimpsed the depths of the commitment which someone is prepared to offer. Give them another chance. After all, partners have given you second chances in the past. 
VIRGO, If you want to avoid tedious chores, you'll have to make a complete break with routine. If, as seems likely, there are responsibilities you can't cancel, you must take life at a careful pace. Plus, you must also consider letting a friend into a secret - when you're ready. 
LIBRA, Keep your eyes open for hidden developments which could affect your long-term future. There's much going on of which you are still only half aware, but which will have incredible consequences on your life over the next six months. And that's quite a thought! 
SCORPIO, Colourful social events are coming. However, you may receive an important item of news which requires a serious and well-considered response. You're tempted to rush decisions, but you should feel free to take your time. After all, more haste, less speed, as they say. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a useful day to consider serious long-term questions. Any news which arrives today is likely to have consequences which go beyond the purely personal, whatever seems to be the case at first sight. Somehow, even complete strangers may be involved in the unfolding pattern. 
CAPRICORN, Close partners are beginning to lay off - and you might have an easier ride in future. You'd better take a look at your financial commitments, mainly because today you seem to have a better than average chance of hitting upon what needs to be done to guarantee future security. AQUARIUS The tide is definitely flowing in your direction, although financial complications are inevitable, mainly because you are about to hit an extravagant phase. Small precautions will help: keep spare cash available and don't bite off more than you can chew. 
TAURUS, Today's Moon is deeply favourable, which is bound to help you in almost any venture. There's a golden rule though, and that's to be as diplomatic as you possibly can. Travel plans should go well, and you can afford to indulge your heart's desire in love. Don't hold back! 
GEMINI, Cash plans require a little extra scrutiny, although there is good news on the way. If you're involved in the property market, or otherwise making large domestic purchases, you should be on the right course. But keep a close eye on changing conditions or you might be caught out. CANCER You always tend to make mountains out of molehills. However, sometimes that is a good thing, for only if you exaggerate small events will you conjure up the grand ambitions which are necessary for a truly fulfilled life. A little imagination can go a long way. 
LEO, Financial conditions still look decidedly positive and will continue to do so for some time. Meanwhile, it will do you good to check practical details and uncover inefficiency. Romantic plans take a turn for the better, and you will soon find that you were right about a particular person. 
VIRGO, The Sun, Mercury and Jupiter are now flying through your chart like a flock of exotic birds, revealing wisdom, good fortune and pressure for change, although not necessarily in that order. Let yourself go, and investigate prospects which once seemed beyond your grasp. 
LIBRA, If you are confused, it's because you are trying too hard to understand a world which is completely irrational! Do yourself a favour, lie back and let your dreams carry you to new lands. You never know - you might come up with some utterly brilliant ideas. 
SCORPIO, You are still inclined to keep your feelings to yourself, much as you may wish to brag and bluster about other areas of your life. Actually, it would do you good to show off a bit, rather than always being so humble. I mean, if you don't blow your own trumpet, nobody else will! 
SAGITTARIUS, A remarkable line-up of planets indicates that career interests are becoming more important, although you'll have difficulty combining existing domestic commitments with new working responsibilities. You need to be noticed! But then, why not? 
CAPRICORN, Are you sure you want to accept what is on offer, or do you want to hold out for the best? There could be a third option, and if you are extremely fleet of foot you may actually be able to have your cake and eat it. Sometimes you get what you deserve! AQUARIUS You have a few private fears and secret worries, as you are only too aware. Today's planets highlight your inner insecurity, but give you the chance to overcome your lack of confidence and lay foundations for the future. A little courage will come in handy. 
TAURUS, You're entering a period which should be marvellous for home entertaining. Make it your main goal to bring family members together, especially if they haven't seen each other for some time and, if someone's been mean to you lately, then forgive and forget. Money stars are due to improve briefly, but you'll still have to keep a close watch on your wallet. 
GEMINI, Think long and hard about what to do next at home. Be sure to consult others about your plans as they'll be happy to fall in and support you. Travel stars are looking up and many Geminis will be spending time away from home over the coming months. Family members may obstruct your plans without warning, but they may have good reason. CANCER Mars and Jupiter are turning their attention to your finances. Such a sign of prosperity is welcome, but when these two planets team up they can also encourage extravagance. That's why it's essential that you take expert advice and always consult partners and people who have your best interests at heart. 
LEO, The ancients believed that Venus and Jupiter were the most beneficial planets in the entire starry realm. The fact that they are both now positively placed is an indication of good fortune, happiness, wealth, success, contentment and prosperity. But only if you work for it! What more could you wish for? 
VIRGO, You'll be getting involved in charitable activities over the coming few weeks. You see, there will be almost nothing which is more important to you than helping your fellow man, or woman. Don't take any notice of random rumours or vague suspicions: they're almost certainly wrong. 
LIBRA, If professional ambitions are your major priority, you will realise that you must now stand on your own two feet. All of you should now begin to broaden your horizons by meeting new people, mixing in fresh places and developing special interests. 
SCORPIO, Work and worldly ambitions are bound to take up more of your time in the future, even for those of you who are members of the leisured classes! Voluntary activities will come your way, allowing you to sparkle. Creative Scorpios will be on good form, by the way. That's good enough reason to start making more of your unique assets. 
SAGITTARIUS, The planets are moving from one position which is very stressful, to another which is pretty well perfect. This week you are entering a new, long-term cycle of great good fortune. The first result should be a feeling that you can do anything you want. 
CAPRICORN, Did you know that yours is the sign of business success? Well, it just so happens that movements in your stars this week reveal that you are moving into a phase of potential prosperity. Past investments are likely to pay dividends before long, but the rewards could be emotional as much as financial. Plus, of course, while the stars create the overall conditions, you have to make the most of them. AQUARIUS You may have to pick yourself up and dust yourself down after recent emotional surprises. However, life is about to improve. Among the areas that are going to blossom, are work and health and, within the month, I expect you to feel much, much better. You can now start looking forward to the happy events which will follow from an imminent invitation. 
TAURUS, As it happens, this is a moment for traditional pursuits, if only because Saturn, symbol of all old-fashioned things, is lurking in the background. There is a shortage of profound planetary influences at the moment, so you may happily enjoy being superficial. READ | China insists Indians vacate Chushul heights, India says clear Pangong north 
GEMINI, This is one of those rare periods when partners or close companions actually pay attention. You may have to use a small amount of emotional blackmail, or make a tiny scene but, one way or another, others should recognise that you must now be noticed. CANCER Things are generally looking quite slack, which doesn't necessarily mean that you're not busy, only that there is an increasing sense of woolliness and uncertainty. If you're in a gambling mood then you may take an emotional risk, but don't play with someone else's feelings. 
LEO, Pleasantly social influences include a slight chance of a difference of opinion, but no other signs of strain. It's not the best day for practical chores, although it's a great time to be irresponsible! You must be prepared for the consequences, though.

VIRGO, Special indications in parts of your chart concerned with money offer a strict warning against financial risks. You should only proceed if you are happy not to receive any return other than pure satisfaction or romantic contentment. In other words, don't hope for cash prizes! 
LIBRA, There is an awful lot to say for pressing ahead with travel plans, although it's not clear that you'll be going on a physical journey. It might be a spiritual adventure which calls you. Also, you may make contact now with family members who are overseas or far away. 
SCORPIO, Business opportunities flow thick and fast, but may be difficult to spot, let alone grasp. This could be a better day for leaving certain fantasies as just that - dreams to be treasured but not implemented. Plus, perhaps a friend can provide the missing piece in an emotional jigsaw. READ | Explained: Tracking the weather system that gave Hyderabad its rainiest day ever 
SAGITTARIUS, The Sun is inaugurating a new period of potential and possible achievement. This doesn't mean, by the way, that everything will be easy, but that even apparently trivial events will have a significance which will not be immediately clear. To an extent, you have to trust in the future. 
CAPRICORN, Focus on everything in your life that is going well. After all, every cloud has a silver lining. Cultivate patience and realise that now is the time to be compassionate, caring, and almost saintly. The more love you put out, the more you can expect back. It's simple, really! AQUARIUS You may be perfectly tuned in to virtuous activities, perhaps doing whatever you can to help others out of a tricky situation. When relaxing, you might take your pleasures with a dash of decadence. Most of all, you love a good story, and you may be spinning someone a yarn.

TAURUS, Your astrological cycles bring new beginnings of a sort every month. Today's particular pattern suggests fresh starts at home, but it seems as if there is not enough time to make best use of certain helpful developments. Actually, you may be saved a great deal of hassle as a result! READ | Bihar elections: Far ahead of rest, BJP vote share has surged since 2005 
GEMINI, The Moon is aligned with your sign today, so take advantage of all pleasant and helpful developments. The one negative planetary influence will encourage you to go for a financial risk - the best bets are connected to boats, the seaside, the arts or fashion. CANCER You can't live in the past for ever, and you simply have to cut out a lot of dead wood, but just how you do it is another matter. You may search your imagination for the right answers, but realise that the best may be the most unusual - a break with tradition perhaps? 
LEO, Courage! You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by jumping in at the deep end. In fact, other people will probably lend you a helping hand, though in ways that you at first fail to recognise. Oh, and even the occasional mistake will help you sharpen up your act. READ | Explained: The comparison between India, Bangladesh per capita GDP 
VIRGO, One thing it is possible to say at the moment is that you have a choice, that somehow home or family life must be the inspiration for your ideas, but that work or public life is most emotionally fulfilling. The precise situation will become clearer by next week. 
LIBRA, You may have seen enough and done enough for now, and you could well feel that it's time to let matters slide. And why not? It's a fine moment to attend to yourself and your own very worthwhile fantasies. Dream a little. You never know - you might come up with a plan for the future! 
SCORPIO, The chance of a financial choice is now looking pretty powerful, although it also looks as if you will make a meal out of options which are in fact seriously trivial. In the long run it may not matter which way you jump. What really counts is your purity of heart! READ | Bhanu Athaiya: India's first Oscar winner, creator of hit Bollywood moments and costumes for 60 yrs 
SAGITTARIUS, You have been ruled by your head rather than your heart. However, deeper feelings come into play today, perhaps prompted by a close encounter of the intense and emotional kind. You'll need to have all your wits about you if you're to figure out what someone else is really up to. 
CAPRICORN, Venus now reviews its dramatic relationship with Jupiter, but the results are likely to be as clear as mud! The more you think you know your feelings, the further you are likely to drift from reality. This is fine if you are happy to abandon your responsibilities. AQUARIUS It doesn't matter whether you start the day racked by tension or completely laid back. Whatever your individual starting point, the Moon will lead you to greater relaxation, so please don't take on additional burdens. All you have to do is learn how to say 'no'.

TAURUS, Everyone experiences a moment when they have to let go and live life to the full. With the Moon now so strong, this looks very much like your time to wave farewell to the past and go your own way. Plus, an unusual invitation could make you wonder about a partner's motives. 
GEMINI, You must take all necessary actions to safeguard your long-term happiness and financial security. It is simply not good enough to rely on other people to bail you out, especially not if you have been rather free and easy with your feelings. You might soon have to pay the price for a former promise!

And if you are unsure about someone else's motives, why not allow them the benefit of the doubt? Plus, please try to focus on overdue practical tasks, and do your best to get up to speed. 
LEO, There's a risk that the approaching lunar revolution will put you on the spot at work. The way to avoid confrontation is to recognise that some of your objections are based in your own past, and may therefore be nothing at all to do with current circumstances. 
VIRGO, You might feel a little bruised and even slightly battered, but you should now raise your sights and concentrate on the moral and ethical implications. The first rule is that two wrongs don't make a right, and that you must do your best whatever the circumstances. READ | Delhi High Court seeks Centre stand on legalising same-sex marriages 
LIBRA, What has transpired recently has made you aware that it is sometimes no use doing things in a charming, gentle manner. You may have become weary of being so considerate, and nobody will blame you if you have a go at somebody. But keep your eye on the eventual goal, which is that everyone agrees to get on! 
SCORPIO, You're in a super-sensitive mood. You may have to pay very close attention indeed to other people's emotional whims and desires, even if they are being decidedly awkward. Perhaps you should have another go at explaining yourself, and do so more effectively this time! 
SAGITTARIUS, Even people who have been keeping things from you will soon relent and reveal all. You may help yourself by paying extra-special attention to purely routine affairs. These, after all, are the key to understanding and, hence controlling, every situation. READ | Khaali Peeli, PM Narendra Modi, Thappad: Films releasing after cinema halls reopen 
CAPRICORN, People at work, chiefly those in command rather than under your control, are still likely to be making life difficult. You, for your part, must insist that your special talents are recognised and respected. It might be wisest to set a good example and let your achievements speak for themselves. AQUARIUS Chance encounters or surprise developments will lead to a more fulfilling lifestyle, and about time, too! Home and family affairs must be handled with care, by the way, partly because somebody may still be seething with anger about something that happened a long time ago. You need to be sensitive to such issues, as I'm sure you know. 
TAURUS, Today's beneficial Moon is somehow special, but it confers on you a duty to be virtuous in every respect. Your standards cannot be allowed to slip, and if they do then you may be the first to lose. Don't criticise others too harshly, at least not until you've had a chance to explain yourself. 
GEMINI, So much now depends on the outcome of a current wrangle over finances. Of course, if you don't care what other people think, and have no worries about the future, you may be as extravagant as possible. You really have to take a cool look at your own circumstances and decide what is best. CANCER You appear to be experiencing a make-or-break situation as far as one emotional tie is concerned. Be aware, though, that such connections may be to places or institutions rather than purely to people. The main issue could be your reluctance to let go of the past. Perhaps now is the time to wave farewell to your memories. 
LEO, Deep down you must know that the time has come when you must put your money where your mouth is. Only when other people have enough regard for you to come in on equal terms will you know that a particular project is worthwhile. And, once you've established clear goals, you'll be much happier. 
VIRGO, Rightly or wrongly, you are renowned for being super-efficient, but to say that you should now be able to turn almost any situation to your own advantage may sound like flattery. However, with the Moon making such a helpful aspect to Jupiter, this is precisely what we must say. 
LIBRA, The recent past appears to have been coloured by flared tempers and tense situations, probably connected with other people's failure to observe proper decorum. For the next four weeks exploit every little opportunity to get your point across as ruthlessly as possible. 
SCORPIO, You don't have to do everything yourself, and you may allow others to push ahead on your behalf. However, you should not attempt in any way to persuade them to go against their own interests. It is not for you to expect others to make a sacrifice. 
SAGITTARIUS, Some financial or business matters seem to have become too much of a hassle, perhaps because certain group ventures have gone off the rails, or if friends have inadvertently undermined your confidence. There may still be time to back out if the price tag seems too high. 
CAPRICORN, You still need to tie up a few loose ends on the work front and ensure that others really will come up with all they promise to provide. However, you may have to accept now that other people must be allowed to drop out of their commitments. A little kindness will be appreciated! AQUARIUS Don't overreact to what is said on the home front by people who frankly should know better. It's not them talking - it's that old emotional Moon sending warnings of romantic turbulence around the corner. As long as you sense how others are feeling, you can take evasive action. 
TAURUS, The major planetary symbols in your solar chart today speak of working relationships, legal questions and ethical issues. Are you sure that you know your rights? By that I mean your real rights, not some fantasy of what you can and can't get away with. READ | Cremation against our wishes, Hathras victim's family to Allahabad HC 
GEMINI, There is a danger in trying to get others to reveal what they are not at liberty to divulge. Such probing is perhaps not such a great problem today, but could increasingly become so over the coming weeks. So, if there's a reason why you should move carefully, that's it! CANCER Although you may still not be able to take an emotional risk as planned, there is much to be said for keeping other people in a state of suspense. If there is to be disruption at home, make sure that you cause it, rather than waiting for partners to weigh in with their own demands for change! 
LEO, Events that are taking place on the work-front seem to involve higher principles rather than narrow self-interest. The most positive angle on today's stars is that it's a suitable moment for you to air grievances. Plus, a change of job might just be perfect. READ | Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog chief: ‘Chip made of cow dung significantly reduces radiation from phone' 
VIRGO, Out of all the turmoil and drama of the past few months, something grand is beginning to emerge. A simple reading of your stars today forecasts unusual purchases. A deep interpretation offers you the chance to free yourself from an outmoded value system. 
LIBRA, Today's planetary alignment crystallises a major long-term cycle indicating substantial improvement in your home situation and family relationships. The psychological angle reveals the need to grapple with the emotional weight of traditional authority. 
SCORPIO, It may be some time before the current celestial combination gives you such a lift again. In some respects, many of you have been turned into human cannon balls, and the Moon now urges you to reach your target. It goes without saying that you should also look where you're going! READ | Reopening of cinema halls: State-wise status 
SAGITTARIUS, This is likely to be a confusing time, but that shouldn't stop you saying what you think. The fact that Mercury, planet of bright ideas, is strongly aligned with your sign, suggests you can be similarly free in your views, arguments and opinions. But please show consideration for other people's feelings. 
CAPRICORN, You can try your best but, if the going gets tough, then all you can really do is muddle through and hope that you don't have too many over-emotional people to deal with. A number of individuals are now in a mood to walk off into the sunset, leaving others to look after themselves. Mind you, that might not be a bad thing! AQUARIUS You're in a competitive mood and you should enjoy jockeying for position. Yet, old-fashioned values are attractive and the trickle of Aquarians discovering the joys of tradition is about to become a flood. As a matter of fact, today is not a bad time to start behaving in contradictory ways! READ | To save their trees, Bastar's tribal sentinels stand up to tradition 
TAURUS, Probably the best thing you can do today is spend a little time in quiet reflection, mulling over the problem of how to make it up to a special person, or perhaps how to reconcile friends who have fallen out. You're interested in the truth - much to your credit. 
GEMINI, There are few indications as to why partners may be irritated. One possibility is that long-term financial commitments are setting them on edge. Another is that they are annoyed by your attitude to money, or perhaps by their belief that you take them for granted. CANCER Personally, and emotionally you seem to be pulled in different directions at the moment. This may not be unusual, so hopefully you should by now know how to deal with such little downs amidst the occasional ups. It's all a matter of striking a sensible balance. 
LEO, The tide of fortune has not yet completely turned and, when it does, you will have to make some very fast decisions. If your work life appears to be bogged down in bureaucracy, be patient and take whatever time is necessary to work through it. And, if you wish, you may let partners set the pace at home. 
VIRGO, You can think of the next few weeks as a time to take on even greater challenges, both personally and professionally. The immediate requirement, though, is to consult family members and take decisions about your home. Try to do your best for others as well as yourself. 
LIBRA, Venus, planet of love, holds you under its sway, enhancing a general feeling of well-being. However, lurking beneath the surface is a deep unconscious demand for personal freedom which will put a strain on at least one close relationship. Hopefully you'll deal with it with your usual grace. 
SCORPIO, Don't be tempted to use finances as a lever because you never know when current actions could rebound on you. It could be next month before long-term plans bear fruit, so do yourself a favour and think ahead. Don't wait for fate to step in and determine the outcome. 
SAGITTARIUS, There's a sense of anticipation in the air. It seems likely that events which have been taking place almost unnoticed, perhaps behind the scenes, are shortly to come into the open. Whatever you do, don't force the pace, and don't make a partner feel as if they're trapped in a corner. 
CAPRICORN, On no account should you do or say anything which might upset or alienate partners or business associates. The fact is that one particular planet - Mercury - indicates that you don't yet know your own mind. Another - Venus - suggests that you can persuade other people to back you in any case. AQUARIUS You really do have an awful lot going for you, although for some reason today seems like a good time to have a moan. Perhaps you're already experiencing the first emotional ripples from the next serious Saturnine alignment, or maybe you're just fed up with someone who has let you down! 
TAURUS, Colleagues and associates have been jockeying for position, but I can't see any cause for you to worry. Indeed, you can stand any amount of competition and rivalry and still come out on top, such is the miraculous protection you receive from Venus, the irrepressible planet of friendship. 
GEMINI, The last series of emotional lunar alignments may have been mildly upsetting, but, on the plus side, at least you now know who your friends are. You've also achieved a much better sense of your own potential and limits. You'll therefore find it much easier to follow your instincts in the future.

However, a sudden enthusiasm may be stalled, perhaps by lack of money. And that's where more experienced people come into the picture - the types who can bankroll your lifestyle. 
LEO, Many Leos are now cruising around incognito, hiding behind a mask or some exotic disguise. You are anxious to avoid the awkward encounters which could take place if you were absolutely honest and open about your intentions. You have every right to keep your feelings to yourself. 
VIRGO, It's because Mercury, your witty planetary ruler, has been sparkling away in powerful regions of your chart, that you have started to come out of your shell. Never lose sight of the knowledge that a general sense of personal satisfaction is more important to you than are the precise details of work and family chores.

LIBRA, This is often one of the most demanding periods of the year at home, not because you're facing great difficulties but on account of the fact that your planetary cycles gather in the same region of your chart. You will soon decide that major improvements are long overdue. 
SCORPIO, Continue your current policy of friendliness and adventure and resist any tendency to slump back into one of your famous Scorpionic moods. You must have realised by now that it's much more pleasant to be happy and optimistic than to be constantly looking out for problems.

SAGITTARIUS, You will be more willing than ever to give others the benefit of the doubt. Most astrologers recognise your open-minded tolerance as one of your greatest qualities and, now that Venus is taking up a fresh challenge to your sign, harmony and co-operation must be your watchwords. 
CAPRICORN, The week's events will soon demonstrate a tendency to spin out of control. You can do your Capricornian bit by maintaining a sense that ethics and morality matter more than personal gain and advantage. Difficult as it may be, you are the perfect person to keep others in line. AQUARIUS Everything's in a state of flux, so you should be in your element. After all, you do so hate to be tied down to the same daily rut which afflicts so many of your friends. Best of all, Venus, which is trucking past various romantic regions of your chart, reveals that someone is about to set your heart fluttering. 
TAURUS, A little self-promotion would be perfectly in place today, so no self-doubt, please. Chance discussions could provoke an emotional reaction, and the facts which are revealed, perhaps by accident, will point towards a fresh understanding of your place in the world.

GEMINI, You're definitely swinging towards a much more money-conscious phase. The emphasis, though, should be on spending cash, or at least putting it to good use. You'll do fine just as long as you scrape enough together to finance any fashionable plans. Before you borrow from a friend, check whether there are any strings attached. CANCER Don't lose your temper or give way to passions of a negative nature. There is too much to gain from talking to people, allowing them to speak for themselves, and forming a new and deeper emotional bond with a loved one. You will come to thank yourself for your restraint. 
LEO, If anything, your dreams seem to be growing stronger, which means that any area of life which thrives on outright and colourful fantasy will benefit. The choices are between fashion, glamour and mysticism, or perhaps a combination of the three. 
VIRGO, Stay busy and keep active. There's a chance of a spot of overtime, and even in the world of routine chores you may be giving your all. The best social encounters will be based around good conversation, which could become more intense than expected. READ | Ginny Weds Sunny review: Pallid writing spoils the fun 
LIBRA, There seems to be some question about what you think should be done at work and what you feel should happen at home. Consider the issues carefully, but accept that both for you and your partners, long-term family interests may now come first. You might have to do some serious thinking. 
SCORPIO, You must now realise that other people are more strong-willed than expected. One very special partner will show that they have a mind of their own. You should accept that change is inevitable, and attempt to guide it positively and wisely. It's the least that you owe yourself. 
SAGITTARIUS, You could be quite active, not always with matters of your own choosing. Cash is important to your thinking, and you'll have a number of hunches as to what should happen next. Try spending a little extra cash to support your fantasies, for that might be only the way to see if there's any chance of a dream coming true. 
CAPRICORN, Friends and acquaintances will have a lot of good ideas, some of them quite remarkably profound. Your feelings will be very easily manipulated, so you may be in a rather vulnerable, if enjoyable, position. Actually, you're about to come up with some stunning ideas yourself, so bide your time. READ | Nobel Peace Prize winner WFP's India link: PDS reforms, rice ATMs AQUARIUS You do seem to have done very well so far and, having made certain important decisions, you should now press ahead and put them into action. Also, please pay as much attention as is necessary to getting into physical shape. After all, a healthy body makes for a healthy mind - as you know! 
TAURUS, Professional and ambitious stars remain strong, suggesting that you may now extend your range of worldly responsibilities. You may become a sort of parental figure, providing some stability for people in general. You'll end up feeling better in yourself as well. READ | Ram Vilas Paswan: Weathervane who worked for Dalits, friends across divide 
GEMINI, Financial security or other money plans may be a superficial concern, but on the deeper psychological level, the question is one of self-worth. Have you undervalued yourself and allowed others to take you for granted? The answer is probably ‘yes'. The solution lies in your hands! CANCER The physical side of relationships is important to you, and definitely requires more attention and understanding. Actually, you are now in a brilliant position to receive all sorts of insights and breakthroughs, completely abandoning old prejudices and preconceptions. 
LEO, Your imagination may still be running riot, which means that fact and fantasy are strangely confused. It's a useful day to listen to partners and follow their lead, especially at home. Be as sensitive as you can to their needs, and you will also be the winner. READ | FinCEN Files: 28 Indian banks asked if they alerted watchdog at home 
VIRGO, It's time to pay a little more attention to your physical well-being, and generally get in shape, cleaning up your diet and smartening up your exercise routine. Also, please check for any glitches in travel arrangements, just to see that if you have to be somewhere important, you arrive in plenty of time. 
LIBRA, There are a number of options in the air at the moment, including a radical revision of relationships with parents or children, introducing a note of eccentricity or something ultra-high-tech into your home, or deciding on a change of career! 
SCORPIO, There are vague chances of muddle today, especially in travel plans, interviews or important discussions, but the results could be worth it. A chance slip of the tongue could reveal far more than expected about the truth of a particular private situation. READ | Retiring in 3-5 years? Here's what you should know 
SAGITTARIUS, There's still a tendency to confusion on the financial front, so tread carefully if large sums are involved. Your ideas may be very sound, but they require a little expert advice. If you're determined to spend, go for purchases which evoke your romantic and visionary sensibilities. 
CAPRICORN, There are philosophers who talk about this life as a long sleep, and consider the world of dreams a return to a reality we left at birth. This sort of intangible notion is one which is important to you at the moment, and can help you understand your feelings on particular matters. AQUARIUS You are likely to take things extremely personally today, but should realise that not everything that happens, or is said, is directed towards you. Make an effort of the imagination and try to understand how loved ones are truly feeling, in spite of their little pretences. READ | Benny Dayal: Most of the views are going to songs which are non-musical 
TAURUS, Everyone wants to succeed, and now is your turn for a stab at fulfilling one of your great ambitions. Make an early start this morning and don't be put off by last-minute diversions or clashes with authority, but keep your cool. Don't fritter your valuable time away. 
GEMINI, Flashes of insight and inspiration are in the air, and could relate to almost any radical change you feel like making. However, it's finances that require most attention. Hi-tech purchases, by the way, could be the best value, and necessities should be a better bet than luxuries. CANCER The ideas are certainly buzzing today. If you should be a little alarmed or put out by partners' suggestions, encourage them to explain themselves. There may be much you can do to fill in the details, so make a start and do as much as is possible, as fast as is feasible. 
LEO, It's difficult to say what's important and what is not at the moment. Everything that changes in your life over the next eighteen months will start in the most familiar surroundings. Even today's trivial events will point you in the direction of future opportunity, so please be alert to the winds of fortune. 
VIRGO, The brightest area of your chart today relates to love and friendship, while the most intense and aggravating aspects are connected to work and worldly ambitions. The best advice is to keep an eye on the legal situation and make sure that you know your rights. 
LIBRA, There is a chance to relive the glories of the past, but it may be impossible to recover anything more substantial than your memories. This is a time to face up to radical decisions that could lead to far-reaching consequences at home. Take the lead and make sure that your needs are met. 
SCORPIO, First things first! The important message is always to walk before you can run. As far as home and family affairs are concerned, this means taking care of routine tasks like emptying the rubbish before even thinking about anything more ambitious! 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything about today shouts that it's decision time. The choices you have to make may be quite small, but their cumulative effect, added up over the coming months, may be very powerful indeed. A favourite ambition might run into trouble, but a delay should be purely temporary. 
CAPRICORN, It seems that you could be touched by genius today. This is not to give you a big head, but you have a strange knack of putting your finger on the truth, even if it's unpalatable! Actually, in many ways, today's planetary patterns suit the serious side of your nature, so you could be well off. AQUARIUS Go with your feelings today. It's a suitable moment to extend a little sympathy - and practical assistance - to those in need. Don't worry about domestic matters - these should take care of themselves, so any intervention is up to you. Leave other people to do their fair share, though. 
TAURUS, It's time to begin to take command, and you can start by ascertaining the precise legal position, or at the very least by seizing the moral high ground. There may also be travel plans to arrange, so get to it!  You really have no excuse for not doing your level best. 
GEMINI, This is no time for dwelling on 'what might have been', but for concentrating on 'what is'. Make a start by licking financial affairs into order, and ascertaining that you are in a good position to gain from future developments. You need to be sure that you are in charge, if only for your own peace of mind. CANCER You may have to give some ground at home but, curiously, even the slightest gesture might be enough. Or, to put it another way, it's the thought that counts. A trip to the past could be a good idea, perhaps as a refuge from the trials and tribulations of the present. 
LEO, This is not a day for frills and frivolities, but for doing all those things that need to be done. That goes for social arrangements, by the way, so get on the phone, write letters, and issue invitations. Oh, and listen carefully to a friend who has a favour to ask. You know it makes sense. 
VIRGO, You may lighten up and take a little time off. With luck, daily events should take care of themselves so, if you sit back and trust that everything will turn out all right, you should be able to coast along. Your natural caution is probably your greatest asset, as it happens. 
LIBRA, You may lay down the law and force others to obey your will at home. At least, you can try! Obviously, only you know how far you can go, but you could find partners considerably more malleable than they've been for weeks. Actually, your best plan is to support other people when they're in the right. 
SCORPIO, You have given partners and colleagues every opportunity to meet you in the middle and agree a new way of doing things. It is now up to them to get on and fulfil their promises, but you must give them time. You should probably also offer them extra support. 
SAGITTARIUS, Money is, of course, very important to your state of mind, even though you are more capable than most people of seeing that it is not everything. That said, the simplest reading of today's stars is that it's a perfect moment to cheer yourself up by wandering around the shops! 
CAPRICORN, There is a higher than usual chance of strange dreams, and you may be vaguely perplexed by feelings or half-formed memories which can't quite be pinned down. Your unconscious is at work, and it's important to try and understand what it's saying. You never know what you might discover! AQUARIUS There can be little doubt that this is still a highly significant moment for a number  of you, and that there are many changes still to occur in your own life and aspirations. Today, you may take some time off to busy yourself with projects which are purely personal. 
TAURUS, Some of you are already experiencing the shot of energy that comes from Mars, the planet of action and aggression. Over the next five weeks you should always remember that being assertive requires that you consider other people's interests equally with yours. READ | Lokayukta leaves a dejected man: Might as well abolish post 
GEMINI, For the next few months your life and feelings will probably be dominated by events which have already occurred. This means that the better you understand everything that took place over the last month, the better you'll manage the future. It's simple really! CANCER You may have all the best ideas, but partners have the emotional edge. In fact, in some strange way they may even be able to use your old tricks against you! If you should be caught out, remember to smile. Oh, and be sure to have a convincing story ready! 
LEO, This week's planetary set-up is certainly a powerful one, and if you are to do your best, you should dedicate today to the virtues of hard work and self-discipline. Get as much accomplished as you can in order to make space for coming social invitations. READ | Bad Boy Billionaires  India review: No revelations, but a gripping narrative of what we know 
VIRGO, There are so many contradictory planetary patterns that you are likely to wonder if you have backed the wrong horse. Please realise that any feelings of indecision, or even of panic, are triggered by a multiplicity of choice. There might just be too much on offer! 
LIBRA, There does seem to be a great deal of travel looming. So strong are these influences over the next few months that even if you stay where you are and never venture out, strangers and people you haven't seen for years will be turning up at your door. There could be some pleasant surprises. 
SCORPIO, Domestic spending still seems to be very important, and could be so for the next few weeks, if not months. If you're buying, selling or renting, you may have to alter your plans several times before the final move is played. But then, your own dreams for the future are also shifting. READ | How and when will schools reopen? What will change for students? 
SAGITTARIUS, What transpires now, in the aftermath of the last eclipse, is bound to turn a number of close relationships upside down. Today's concerns may focus on your emotional security: does someone still feel about you the way you feel about them? If so, get in touch! 
CAPRICORN, You haven't had it all your own way recently, but the cards are stacked in your favour today, even though you may be slightly uncomfortable, perhaps with a feeling that there's too much emotion around. At least you have an opportunity to get your way at home - so use it! AQUARIUS The best thing you can do today is listen to your conscience, and also explore your day-dreams. You see, there's a good chance that the answers to current questions are to be found within, deep in your soul, not in the outside world. A spot of navel-gazing could be a good idea. READ | Hathras protests: Conspiracy, says Yogi Adityanath, police file 21 FIRs across UP, six in Hathras 
TAURUS, There is a very high chance of a lucrative financial offer. Stop and think, though, for this is one of those times when a wonderful opportunity could vanish as fast as it appears. Opposition from partners should diminish as the day passes, so someone who has been bothering you may quietly slip away. Follow Hathras rape, protests LIVE updates here 
GEMINI, This is a time for action but not for commitment. One possible course is to surrender to fate and allow circumstances to dictate the pace. This requires considerable courage, for you must learn to trust in the future. That's difficult I know, but it's essential. Also Read | FSL report used samples 11 days old, has no value: Aligarh CMO on Hathras case CANCER The possibility of secret emotions and fantasies now seems to be at a height. There may be an element of deception, but very much more noticeable are your idealistic tendencies - including your admirable belief in a better world - and these should sustain you. 
LEO, Your social stars are extremely powerful, and this is one of those times when, at your most extreme, you may fall in love one minute, and then out of love the next. At the very least you should be shuffling your friends and re-arranging engagements. 
VIRGO, Keep a close watch on professional developments. A major opportunity will come and go very quickly, and it will be up to you to seize the moment. You may even have a chance to opt out of a commitment in which you always thought you were trapped. But do you really want to be free? That could be what you're about to find out.

LIBRA, The urge to travel, or to be somewhere else, may be absolutely irresistible. If you have the freedom to take off at a moment's notice, do so. Otherwise you'll have to find whatever way you can to bring a little inspiration into your life. I'm sure you'll manage. 
SCORPIO, Money makes the world go around is one old familiar saying with fresh relevance. Another is 'money doesn't talk, it swears', which may sum up your mood today! The fact is, though, that a little careful forethought will avert any problem the stars can throw at you. 
SAGITTARIUS, If today is all sweetness and light, you're missing out on something. But, if there should be any signs of imminent crisis, face up to them and get to grips with as many problems as you can. In so doing, you'll clear the air and lift a weight from your shoulders. Idea Exchange | RS Sharma: 'Amazon, Facebook are exclusive, not interoperable' 
CAPRICORN, Much depends on your ability to cope with routine daily chores. The most you can expect from today's stars is the chance to change jobs, and the best advice you can be offered is to tackle overdue tasks before the pressure becomes irresistible. Oh, and keep financial pressures in perspective. AQUARIUS Be prepared to do a U-turn. In fact be prepared to do two! It's important that you have as much freedom as you need to change your mind and then change it back again. This is such an important time in your personal development that you can't be constrained by what other people think or expect. 
TAURUS, Venus, your charming planetary ruler, is still cruising merrily along through influential sectors of your chart, raising hopes of a better social life. Time is running out and I strongly suggest that you revive any plans that have been left on the back-burner. Take the initiative - don't wait for people to get in touch with you. 
GEMINI, Your social life is being affected by a bout of secrecy. Have you perhaps been entrusted with information which must in no circumstances be passed on? Despite your tendency to blurt things out you must always remember that this is a time for discretion. CANCER The Sun and the Moon, the two most significant bodies in your chart, don't always agree. But this week they pile the pressure on at home and in all your most personal affairs. This is actually a significant moment, and you can begin to chart a new course in family matters. 
LEO, You are about to be pulled between two extremes. You may either go all out for worldly success. Or you may tuck yourself away out of sight and out of mind. Actually, there is a middle way: work quietly behind the scenes, discreetly laying the foundations for future achievements. 
VIRGO, By all means continue to make professional plans, if that is what concerns you. However, you are too big a person to imagine that your ambitions can be refined down to whatever happens at work. Indeed, a great many of you must now realise that your true personal ambitions are yours and yours alone. 
LIBRA, As I've said so many times before, your home and family affairs seem to be perpetually riddled with complications and contradictions. Yet now it is time to look out to the world around you, involving yourself in your community and seeking help for your private goals. 
SCORPIO, Far-sighted Scorpios have arranged an adventure or interesting outing for the next week. You see, Jupiter, the planet which represents all your outgoing qualities, will draw you to foreign climes and fascinating places. Scorpios who have relations active in higher education, should see these lucky people come a step closer to attaining their aims. 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything looks bright and sunny. One planet arouses your romantic feelings, another brings new friendships and a third is determined to boost your prosperity. Sagittarians in the property market are set for a stroke of luck, perhaps a chance to make a new beginning. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon aligns itself with a number of helpful regions in your chart, one of which is your seventh solar house. In plain terms this means that you are in for a remarkable and pleasurable social phase. Hopefully, there'll be plenty of entertaining and the possibility of putting new friendships on a more permanent basis. AQUARIUS Mercury, planet of communication, has the claim to be the most helpful planet in your celestial sphere at the moment. This is because it is feeding you with a series of special ideas and it will be much easier for you to persuade people that you are right and much more difficult for them to show that you are wrong. 
TAURUS, You're ready and willing to take on the responsibility for seeing that joint plans work out. In fact, the businesslike alignments in your chart are so strong that even love affairs fall under their sway, in a manner of speaking. In other words, you'll have to work to keep relationships on the line. 
GEMINI, You're keen to do the right thing, and the ethical situation is looking interesting, to say the least. You'll probably find that at the root of all working relationships and obligations lies a general concern over standards. Other people may disagree, mind you. Also Read | Hathras: 300 police personnel lock down grieving family, entire village CANCER You've made some fine judgements, and a calculated risk could now pay off. The best purchases and investments are likely to combine beauty with tradition - antiques, for example. The most ideal romantic partners are those offering security in addition to passion. 
LEO, People at home are unlikely to make many demands. But, even if they only make one, they will force the issue with such persistence that you will have to be very strong indeed if you are to resist. It's all to do with a challenge from the Moon - but it won't last long. 
VIRGO, A stressful and challenging aspect can be turned to good advantage if you are determined to succeed - and unwilling to be put off by temporary distractions. It's excellent for all who are genuinely in search of new work, or who are happy to broaden their horizons. Also Read | One lakh Covid deaths in India, Maharashtra has nearly 40% 
LIBRA, A financial risk may be a better bet than an emotional one, but only if, paradoxically, your goal is to maintain the status quo. Your main romantic consideration will be the desire for long-term stability, and all social arrangements must be placed on a formal footing. 
SCORPIO, It's a time for elegance, grace and traditional values. You may be strangely fascinated by romantic bad luck, but it is no use dwelling on memories or wallowing in regret. Instead, you should actively plan your future in the knowledge that, even if plans don't work out as intended, they might work out better than you hoped. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mercury's delicate relationship with Neptune is just one aspect which teases you with nostalgia and sentiment. If you're in business, shuffling huge sums of cash or making large purchases, do be aware that such feelings will influence your financial decisions.

CAPRICORN, It is ironic that while today's lunar aspect gives you the advantage at home and in family affairs, it also makes you more sensitive. Then again, perhaps you will get what you want more easily if you are prepared to reveal your feelings. Partners' respect for you can only increase if you show how honest you are. AQUARIUS Keep yourself to yourself, and don't let anyone probe into affairs which are yours and yours alone. Also, remember that at work, and in the public arena, it is your ability to get on with authority figures that is crucial. It's all a matter of reaching a suitable compromise. 
TAURUS, You want the best - and why not? To reach the goals you are now so keen to achieve, will take a good deal of effort, but the results and rewards may eventually outstrip your expectations, especially if you plan properly. Legal and ethical issues deserve your full consideration. 
GEMINI, You may imagine that a financial choice has been satisfactorily delayed. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Important developments over the next few days could substantially affect your future prosperity, and I suspect it will be for the better. Read | Day after police rushed her cremation, HC steps in, asks officials to explain CANCER I would be the first to admit that emotional security is vital to your happiness but, as the days pass, amazing events will alter your outlook on a pattern you thought was so predictable. Don't rely on long-term plans, for everything is up for grabs over the next couple of weeks. 
LEO, If you haven't already got the bit between your teeth, you probably have plenty of spare time left. You have perhaps four or five weeks to prepare your ground, whether it's a personal goal that's at stake, or a professional coup. But you should be aware that partners may take some persuading. 
VIRGO, Spontaneity, joy and pleasure are yours for the asking. The Moon's passage from one part of your chart to another makes it apparent that you must have a clear head and work out exactly what it is that you want. After all, you can't expect other people to satisfy you if you don't even know what to ask for! Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates 
LIBRA, You can take a series of slow but significant steps down the street of success, but there'll be a number of sharp bends along the way. Don't be surprised if the ground is swept from under your feet at home - and watch out for electronic machines and explosive gadgets. 
SCORPIO, You may believe that the last word has been said, but if that is the case you are very wrong. You will soon discover that your mind has changed, and that others are likely to come back with some surprising news. What you hear may also have a surprising effect on your affections. 
SAGITTARIUS, There are some things that cannot be changed, no matter what you do. Yet perhaps you can say enough to reassure people that past slights were unintended or that future goals are good for everyone. Get your thinking cap on and work out the best way to persuade partners that you're right! Read | In Hyderabad, caste turns love story into a story of hate and murder 
CAPRICORN, It is time to set yourself new goals, adopt different priorities and leave behind the lost opportunities of recent times. But do keep a very open mind and be prepared for last-minute changes, particularly where very close partners are concerned. AQUARIUS Venus and Mercury are moving towards one of their periodic uncertain celestial patterns. It is therefore very likely that you will actually encounter someone you thought had disappeared - perhaps for ever. Also, be prepared for a true, magical, romantic mystery. 
TAURUS, You're getting mixed messages. Neighbours or relatives could say one thing, family members another. The trouble is that nobody will say exactly what they mean. This isn't their fault - it's that mischievous planet Mercury which is making communication so difficult. 
GEMINI, There is no doubt whatsoever that you have a very difficult furrow to plough, but equally every possibility that you can evade your responsibilities if you wish. The cavalry should arrive in about forty eight-hours in the form of drastically changed planetary alignments. CANCER It is not possible to control the factors around you as closely as you might like. It is often quite exciting to sit back and let fate take a hand, and this is how you may play it over the next three days. Just take care not to incur extra costs, though, as they might run out of control. 
LEO, There's a fair amount of ambition in the wind today, and I think you'll be very purposeful about getting your own way. Just watch out for an unforeseen confrontation at the very last minute, and take the appropriate action. You might want to duck the problem altogether. 
VIRGO, Your long, drawn-out struggle to transform aspects of your personal life is surely about to bear fruit. You will be amply recompensed in a very few days, especially if you are prepared to strike out on your own. This is one time when courage could be rewarded. 
LIBRA, Home and family life continue to occupy a central role in your horoscope. Relations may well be getting up to their old tricks, but what is more important is the psychological dimension and the requirement that you build your life on firm emotional foundations. 
SCORPIO, Be prepared for controversial statements. If you can possibly come out with some sharp ideas of your own, so much the better. Life does look a little argumentative, so you should seek allies today, ready for a trial of wills any time over the next two or three days. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your heart is fluttering after a recent flirtation. Even if it's all a fantasy, you can allow yourself to feel good. The best thing you can do today is press on with routine tasks and ignore a minor provocation. But do make a point of placating partners before they explode. 
CAPRICORN, The planet to watch now is Uranus, the eccentric celestial body which will soon force you to reassess your life, particularly your finances. You should take nothing for granted and be ready move at the drop of a hat. It's clear that you need to pay more attention to your material resources, whatever other people say. AQUARIUS The Sun and the Moon will soon be coming together in a dramatic alignment which even now may be making its presence felt. Don't be disturbed by potentially upsetting events or feelings, but look closer and see that there's much you can learn and discover about yourself. 
TAURUS, Today's events are likely to have an air of mystery about them. A spot of confusion is likely, but time spent alone or in relative seclusion can prove to be genuinely enjoyable. Let nobody call you stuffy, for you are about to surprise us all - and how! 
GEMINI, It may take time to get going - you seem to have slipped a gear or two. However, I think the best thing you can do is turn your attention back to interests and questions which you once found so fascinating, but which have since been put on the shelf. CANCER Variety is the spice of life. At least it ought to be, for you are again about to be presented with an opportunity to come out of your shell and become the darling of your social circle. Please don't hold back and, once you have made up your mind, there is no point in counting the cost. 
LEO, It is often said that this is a time of year for children, to which I see some adults holding their heads in their hands! Yet there are many lessons you can learn from small people when it comes to spontaneous pleasure. That's why you should pay attention for once! 
VIRGO, The stars have shifted decisively into those regions of your solar chart with significance for your home and family. Ironically the result may be a bout of indecision over the coming week, possibly because your options will expand and the alternatives grow! 
LIBRA, You're ready to be cheered up. One piece of good news is that an excursion or meeting which was cancelled or postponed should soon be back on the agenda. The accent is on personal and joint money matters, but it seems that you may sit on the fence for a little while longer. 
SCORPIO, Be secretive, firm and realistic. In other words, you may be yourself. Other people might no longer agree with you, but it seems that you control the purse strings. You can therefore present partners with a financial fait accompli, and they will have to smile and accept your decisions. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have shown a tendency to fritter your money away in the past, but you'll soon have a chance to think again, and maybe to change your mind. Please remember that there is absolutely no room at all for complacency, mainly because although you think that a personal matter is now settled, there is still more information to come. 
CAPRICORN, If you feel you have to hide away to get enjoyment now, it may be because you are uncertain how others will react once they know how you really feel. This is fine, and I don't think anyone should criticise you for hanging on to a long-standing secret. AQUARIUS Compromise is not a big feature of your chart over the next few months, and I think you're unlikely to bend now. Only on minor and possibly irrelevant details will you be happy to let partners get their way. On the other hand, if you want to keep loved ones sweet you should probably throw them some crumbs of comfort. 
TAURUS, There is a slight chance that your financial affairs have been, or are about to be, thrown into utter confusion by circumstances beyond your control. However, look closely and you'll see that in fact you have been liberated from a major burden. READ | Nirmala Sitharaman interview: 'Fight us in House, attract smaller parties, keep us under watch…but Cong moving further to fringe' 
GEMINI, You may have swallowed a tall story, but I don't think anyone should laugh at you for being gullible. The fact is that fiction can have more meaning and pertinence than fact. People who refuse to recognise this condemn themselves to a grey, drab life. CANCER You can stand your ground and continue to play for time. You see, only when you are absolutely convinced that a major alteration in the pattern of your personal life is to your advantage should you agree to discuss a peace treaty. And then you can meet a partner halfway. 
LEO, This is not really a time for self-reflection, but I'd still say that if you are prepared to reassess your personal values, you will do yourself a great deal of good. Watch out for emotional outbursts from people who just can't see how good life really is. READ | Drugs case: ‘Deepika Padukone was questioned about some words in chats' 
VIRGO, You will have to work hard to keep your emotions in check, but the question is - why shouldn't other people see how you feel? One key to happiness at the moment is spontaneity: I think that children and younger relations can teach you a lot about pleasure. 
LIBRA, Sixty percent of your major planetary patterns are featuring fundamental issues, aligned with the foundations of your chart and rooting you to the spot. Don't feel frustrated by other people's demands, but do appreciate the fact that you are wanted. 
SCORPIO, Why do other people imagine that they have a claim on your time and talents? Perhaps it's because you've sent out the wrong signals in the past. Now is the time to clarify your thoughts and issue clear proclamations for the future. Others need to know what you think. READ | The Comey Rule review: An absorbing political drama 
SAGITTARIUS, Your solar chart is looking so utterly businesslike at the moment, that you ought to be on firm ground when discussing long-term investments. You'll have a chance to make family choices next week, but you may have to relinquish some of the limelight. 
CAPRICORN, Stunning planetary aspects may relate to your personal life, or they could refer to your professional activities. What is crucially important though is the exciting way they encourage you to exceed your personal best. I don't think anything can hold you back now. AQUARIUS You ought to be enjoying some kind of recognition for all your hard work, but for some reason everyone's good intentions seem to be fog-bound. Other people's statements may be entirely different from what they mean, and you may have to figure out a strange emotional puzzle. READ | Explained: What is the Maratha quota debate? 
TAURUS, Just what are other people up to? Somebody certainly seems to have a big claim on your time. Whether you should indulge their demands, though, is another question. On the whole, I don't think you have anything to lose, and you may have a great deal to gain! 
GEMINI, You seem to have lost control over one important matter, probably something to do with day-to-day survival and responsibilities. Yet there's no problem that can't be solved by putting engagements off for a couple of days or weeks - or even months! READ | No end date, no sure shot vaccine.stimulus rolling, won't hesitate to spend: Sitharaman CANCER The day's stars certainly seem generally auspicious, but it is uncertain whether you really should be ambitious on your own account. You see, when passions are rising, life can go in any direction without warning. A good compromise may be to do your best by others! 
LEO, In many respects the current season is designed with you in mind. You were born with ample reserves of bonhomie and jolly generosity and it's fair enough for family, friends and partners to expect you to take the lead. Put any qualms to one side. 
VIRGO, It's not easy to take those awkward decisions, but why worry? Social events should take care of themselves, while even family questions will be answered to your satisfaction. The past should provide the inspiration for the present - and tomorrow, the future actually becomes the present! READ | Explained: How Vajpayee took on Nehru govt over 1962 Chinese aggression 
LIBRA, You may be relieved of a choice that needs to be made at home. On the one hand your dilemma may become far less pressing. On the other, you will find it much easier to talk to people around you. Luckily social prospects improve dramatically tomorrow, so keep your options open. 
SCORPIO, It now looks increasingly likely that a partner may have something significant to say, especially if you have inadvertently thrown your weight around. On the other hand, you may appreciate their apparent new-found interest in your affairs. 
SAGITTARIUS, You will be liberated from a promised - or threatened - expense, but perhaps not for another forty-eight hours. All you can do now, though, is cough up and hope for the best - then wait. Social, romantic and emotional stars remain primed for passion at any price. 
CAPRICORN, Today's top planetary pictures are somewhat sensitive and therefore ideal for those about to be swept away on a wave of sentiment. A special word for any of you expecting good news: seize the high ground and take no nonsense from anybody. READ | SAD-BJP alliance weathered many a storm unscathed — until now AQUARIUS For you more than most people, the meaning of the current week is extremely important and, if you listen to the voices within, you may gain one or two mystical realisations. You'll not be a hermit, though, as the relationship between stars in your house of friends and house of partners remains very special. 
TAURUS, Your social stars are becoming stronger by the day. Confidence, they say, breeds success. This is true but, now that your stars are looking increasingly optimistic, may I advise a little caution. Go into any risky situation with your eyes wide open. Professionally, Tuesday and Wednesday could be your toughest days. 
GEMINI, The most helpful cosmic pattern this week occurs on Wednesday, when the Sun forms a new relationship with Jupiter, a splendid planet which indicates general good fortune. This celestial body also encourages prudence, justice and good manners. On the other hand, reckless actions and unwise speculations can only result in loss. CANCER Undoubtedly, a special time of year is fast approaching. In the meantime, there is still a spot of confusion to clear up, a mystery to resolve, or a lost object to find. Make the most of the current planetary energies and enjoy a favourite fantasy. Even in business, your imagination can show the way forward, so don't be afraid to follow your dreams. 
LEO, Money matters are due to grow dramatically in importance over the next two weeks. The general trend of events is entirely auspicious, so please exploit all welcome personal offers, opportunities and bargains the moment they arise - and no later! Plus, Venus' charming and affectionate location can only boost your self-esteem. 
VIRGO, All-in-all this looks like a positive week. Not for the first time your stars are perfectly poised at work. What's more, you may impress an employer early in the week. You will make all the right choices and charm others with your elegant wit, while your love life will be blessed by your poetic soul. 
LIBRA, A series of helpful planetary patterns are bound to work in your favour, and this could be a quite remarkable moment. Lost objects will be found, delayed decisions will be taken and old friends will turn up - completely out of the blue! You will even, at long last, get an inkling of some very good news indeed. At work, a new responsibility is coming your way. 
SCORPIO, Your instincts are working well, and there are many ways of turning apparent obstacles to your advantage on Monday or Tuesday. One is to spend money judiciously, compensating for any past economies, all the while making it clear to loved ones that you really do care. Health matters will benefit from an improvement in diet. 
SAGITTARIUS, A number of potent planets will fall exactly in the crucial central portion of your sign, focusing your attention on vital long-term issues. It looks very much as if some sort of major adjustment at home will be the result of pressures which have been building up over recent months. If you have a chance to learn a new skill, do so: you never know when it will come in handy. 
CAPRICORN, Serious Saturn steps up its role in your chart. Think hard about where you must go from here at work, but don't delay: you have but a narrow window of opportunity during which you may make an effective and realistic choice. In love, all you need is sympathy but, first, partners will need to know that you are right behind them. AQUARIUS You are certainly feeling much more determined and, if all goes according to plan, you will feel greatly relieved that problems which have bedevilled you for so long will finally be laid to rest. However, it is vital that you stand up to other people's demands and expectations with all the determination  that you can muster. 
TAURUS, There is still some leeway in romantic and social affairs, but not much. A good approach for you is to be optimistic and explain to partners just how much better life could be if only they saw things the way you do! Mind you, is it really a good thing for others to agree with you? A few differences of opinion might be more constructive. READ | Bollywood drugs case: Deepika, Shraddha at NCB; Sara to appear soon 
GEMINI, The best advice is to take some time off and go shopping. It is a strange but wonderful fact that treating yourself to a few luxuries can lift your morale and take your mind off emotional muddles. Also, have you thought that you might have misjudged someone? CANCER In any ordinary circumstances the fact that the Moon is supporting your sign should give you much greater control over your emotions, and other people's, come to that. However, these are not ordinary circumstances, and fate is set to take a hand. READ | 19-yr-old raped in Hathras fights for life, Dalit family says used to staying quiet 
LEO, You may be unusually reticent today. That is, you might still be able to present yourself to others as an outgoing and confident individual, but inside you'll wonder just what on earth is happening, and you'll treasure a chance to spend a little time alone. READ | FinCEN Files — Flagged in each offshore tax probe, Rosy Blue is now on US radar 
VIRGO, Your social stars are so strong that it would be a crying shame if you didn't take the initiative, and a greater shame if friends failed to heed your suggestions. Good conversation, even a spirited argument, should form the centrepiece of your day! 
LIBRA, It's certainly an excellent moment for all professional individuals to plan their next step. The underlying psychological pattern reveals a need for recognition in your community and praise from your peers. But that's something you need to work for! 
SCORPIO, Mercury forms a sensitive relationship with Pluto, planet of truth, an emotional pattern which forces you to take final decisions. If you should feel a strange sense of recognition, it's because, personally speaking, you have indeed been here before. READ | Retrospective taxation: the Vodafone case, and the Hague court ruling 
SAGITTARIUS, Business matters take a forward leap, even though it seems as if you may be unaware of the strength of your position. You may look to other people to provide an element of security and stability that you feel is lacking. You may also encourage others to make a move that they've been putting off for too long. 
CAPRICORN, You really have little choice but to listen to other people, and you might even have to swallow your pride and do what they tell you. In no way will this detract from the potential pleasure you may derive from today's intense social encounters. AQUARIUS It's an emotional moment, and you are eager to do your best. Work hard, play hard seems to be the message. The words of caution for today are first to avoid over-straining yourself and secondly to be very wary of those in authority: don't overstep the mark.

TAURUS, You may tie up financial loose ends today, and decide on particular purchases or investments one way or the other. As far as the need for emotional commitment is concerned, there may be creative paths around a current dilemma. All you have to do is find them! Give it time. 
GEMINI, The Moon continues playing a powerfully supportive role, so you can still afford to take a confident line. It's as if the cards are stacked in your favour, and even if someone else plays a trump card, you can still come out on top. You're really in quite a strong position. CANCER If you should imagine that you are running out of time, you are very, very wrong. Time is precisely what you have, so don't rush to complete tasks and achieve ambitions at the risk of forgetting vital details. What you really need to do now is encourage others to play their full part. 
LEO, Most people think that there is something wrong with being immature, but they're wrong. There are times, such as now, when the best way to relax and rediscover your vitality, is to return to pastimes you gave up long ago. Life favours the young-at-heart. 
VIRGO, A new emotional cycle begins today, one which is more relaxed and hopefully enjoyable than of late. All artistic and creative types will also be favoured, and  you should develop long-neglected skills and talents. What you need to do next is let someone important into your confidence. 
LIBRA, You will now be showing yourself in all your indecisive splendour. You are often criticised for failing to make up your mind, but surely you are now better placed than partners  who take hasty decisions. They may even come to envy your position. 
SCORPIO, You may take a charitable view of the world, and see what you can do to assist people who are worse off than you. The plain fact is that you want to do your bit to help, and partners will be foolish not to recognise this. Plus, of course, you can make sure others know that you have the right to make your own decisions. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you are tired of making up your own mind, how about doing what other people want for a change? You can't be tough and independent all the time. Sometimes it's better to defy expectations and put your feet up and leave others to put the world to rights. 
CAPRICORN, Venus, the planet which signifies your romantic hopes and dreams, alters its position ever so slightly, bringing in its train the possibility of more love and affection than you could wish for. That's wonderful. Dreams are one thing, though, reality another. AQUARIUS The most amusing social gatherings should involve a touch of nostalgia. So, if you can contact old friends and recreate the past, you could have a time to remember. You may even manage to forget tensions at work! Mind you, you might also be ready for a spot of escapism, sticking your head in the sand! 
TAURUS, The key question now is the extent to which you have allowed yourself to be taken for granted and walked all over like some sort of cosmic doormat. Watch out for dictatorial people and take evasive action. If you can stay out of their way, then you will end the day much happier! 
GEMINI, The Moon should give you a feeling of confidence, although there will be a few mood swings and these in turn will bring occasional self-doubt. However, in the final analysis you should feel hopeful about the future. Optimism breeds success - and attracts potential employers. CANCER You still seem to be doing extremely well in many respects, and the best approach is one which highlights your creative gifts. You must realise that there is no area of your life free from your intense emotions. If you acknowledge that, then you'll be able to keep them in check. 
LEO, Supportive planets are helping you keep your feet on the ground, which is just as well at a time such as this. You're entering a new emotional cycle, one in which there'll be little time for romance or sentimentality. Instead, look at down-to-earth issues, such as how much you can actually afford! 
VIRGO, You have a reputation for being clear-headed and reasonable, yet too many people are completely failing to see just how far your ideas are driven by an intense and idealistic desire to see the world put to rights. If only they would leave you to get on at your own pace. 
LIBRA, You should keep an eye on the financial situation and realise that what other people mistake for strength could actually be a sign of weakness. It would therefore be folly to shape your actions to partners' expectations. Perhaps they should do what you want this time. 
SCORPIO, Your indecisive streak is coming out. Not before time, some people would say! Your first instinct when faced with a dilemma may be to return to the safety of former conditions. That's fine in the short term, but you can't put off the inevitable forever! 
SAGITTARIUS, Your emotional loyalties may now be based in the present rather than in the past. Yet for some reason you will find it increasingly important to back-track, and work out just exactly what did happen, and why a relationship came to an end. You might also be tempted to take advice you'd normally ignore. 
CAPRICORN, You can be easy to stereotype. Too many people underestimate your versatility, especially at work. If partners and colleagues would only sit down and listen to your ideas for sharing responsibilities more equitably in the future, they'd learn a lot! AQUARIUS There is much to be said for tackling social issues head-on, but mainly if money is involved. The one thing you must be sure of at the moment is that partners and friends will be changing their opinions more often than their socks! Not that it's a bad thing, of course. 
TAURUS, No doubt you are recovering from yesterday's emotional ups and downs. There will be a shift of emphasis towards monetary desires and concerns, but please don't imagine that partners' hopes have been met by recent agreements. There might still be some way to go before they're satisfied. 
GEMINI, A new dimension opens in your chart today, one which will encourage partners to act very strangely indeed. Look closely, however, and you may begin to see that it's your perceptions which are changing, rather than their actions. Perhaps it's time to move on. CANCER Mars, ruling your energy levels, is still set to sustain you, but it cannot take care of every eventuality. This is why you must now turn your attention to the most routine, mundane tasks, for it's here that you are likely to overlook essential details. 
LEO, Even though you should be considering longer-term issues and broadening your horizons, the pressure to achieve something now, in the immediate future, is still very strong. If your desires haven't been granted, return to first principles, and make a fresh start. 
VIRGO, Don't let others push you into hasty decisions. You still have much to gain from being patient. However, you're entering a new phase at home which will make you wonder just how much patience is required. The answer is simple: an infinite amount! 
LIBRA, Your daily cycle indicates optimism and adventure, but a new fortnightly pattern which begins today shows uncertainty and confusion. The advice is simple: pace yourself and never make a move until you are certain of the outcome. Also, if partners think you should do whatever you're told, try putting your point of view - and see how they react. 
SCORPIO, Spare a little thought for financial matters. You may be confused by the different options, and if you decide to scrap current involvements and return to the past, that is entirely your decision. Just pay a little attention to what partners think. 
SAGITTARIUS, Just when you thought that everything was clear, conditions change. Mercury is now behaving strangely. This is one way of saying that, for the next two weeks, you'll have the distinct feeling that for every two steps forward, you'll be taking three backwards! 
CAPRICORN, This is undoubtedly a very fine moment for a spot of creative self-expression. Whether it is fun and pleasure to which you turn, or the rather more serious matter of making your fortune, this is definitely a time to come to know yourself better! AQUARIUS Get in touch with old friends. That is the simple message of today's planetary movements. Other indications are equally forthright: have fun, be creative and recharge your batteries by spending time with children, sharing the things that they enjoy. 
TAURUS, Today's lunar alignments signify sharp changes in your mood. Early uncertainty may be replaced by burgeoning confidence, and that has to be good news. You're on a slow fuse and it could be a question of lighting the blue touch paper and then retiring to a safe distance. 
GEMINI, Why are you so secretive? Because you have good reason is the only realistic answer. It may be that other people are just not ready to hear what you have to say. Perhaps they haven't enough sensitivity to give you a fair hearing. Leave it a couple of days if you wish. CANCER Social pressures are powerful, and could prove distracting, but the underlying issue in your chart concerns your long-term hopes and wishes. It's a useful moment for summoning up all your reserves of determination, and for setting out your stall for the future. 
LEO, There is a time for everything, and now is the moment to compete. Professional types should spare no effort in aiming for the top, which means changing their attitude to a number of colleagues. All of you, whether you're at work or not, should now make a bid for recognition and acclaim. 
VIRGO, The areas of your life which stand to benefit most, at least in the long run, include higher education, legal questions, moral issues and overseas connections. It's important to keep an eye on matters of principle, and always to hold the ethical high ground. 
LIBRA, Your own ideas are good, but perhaps not good enough. Do take great care with joint finances, especially if you're spending other people's money. Indeed, it may be sensible to follow the most cautious path possible and put everything on hold for a few days. 
SCORPIO, Look, listen and learn is the best planetary advice. The Moon's challenge to your sign is a powerful call for mature and considered responses, rather than hasty reactions based on past experience. Besides, if you do try to go it alone, a partner may stand in your way. 
SAGITTARIUS, Tread carefully at work. This is an appropriate moment for beginning a new job, but, by the same token, you could also be giving up old responsibilities. It's important to see that events work out in your favour. Also, bear in mind that what really interests you is helping others out of a tight spot. 
CAPRICORN, The planets are urging you to give in to your desires. Whether you do or not depends on what they are and, of course, your circumstances. You should pay all necessary attention to children, listen carefully to younger relations and cultivate your creative powers. AQUARIUS There seems to be an inexorable pressure for change at home. Whether this comes to fruition or not depends on you, for you will have to take current developments and carry them that extra mile. You might be owed an apology, by the way, but it may be slow in coming. 
TAURUS, A build-up of lively lunar alignments is already sending emotional ripples in your direction. The waters of life may soon be a little choppier than you would like, but you may use any changes in your routine as an opportunity for self-reflection. 
GEMINI, You may be concerned first with how to put your ideas into practice, and secondly with how to prevent certain other people from knowing exactly what you're planning! Take trusted individuals into your confidence sooner rather than later, and you'll stand a better chance of getting your way. CANCER Think ahead. You may be concerned with the need to fulfill immediate responsibilities, but your day will be all the more successful if you have a long-term strategy. This, you see, will enable you to identify the underlying patterns in your affairs. 
LEO, The heart of all current questions concerns your ambitious desire to be somebody. If you fail to make any effort in this direction you will bring frustration upon yourself. Ultimately, it doesn't matter whether you succeed or fail, just as long as you try. 
VIRGO, At home and in your private life, you should expect a fair degree of confusion. This is to be welcomed as a sign that change is being forced upon you, giving you the opportunity to make whatever improvements you feel are necessary. Try to ensure that everyone shares in the benefits. 
LIBRA, There is still a great deal to gain from being as generous as possible. Remember all those wise sayings about not living by bread alone, and realise that money is there to be used, not hoarded away. Your high hopes will come to nothing unless you actually get on and do something about them! 
SCORPIO, This is a fairly powerful period emotionally, but in many ways less intense than you have come to expect at such moments. The cause celebre of the day could be money, and if you're wondering just what is going on, give yourself a little more time. 
SAGITTARIUS, Get off to an efficient and organised start today. There is no time for early morning blues. Given that there may soon be a brief, stormy period at work, it's in your interests to be fully prepared. In fact, you&#039;d be advised to steal a march on people at home as well. 
CAPRICORN, It may be an overstatement to say that this is a moment for unrestrained pleasure, but it is certainly a fine time to give the highest priority to your personal creativity and desire for self-expression. And don't let someone dent your enthusiasm, however hard they try. AQUARIUS Get back to basics today. For some of you, this could mean that home and family affairs take up so much time that you never actually get going on anything else. At work, try as best you can to create a cosy atmosphere. Make sure that colleagues know they can rely on you. 
TAURUS, You may well feel that other people have got away with too much - and that it's time to be a little more assertive. However, in view of the fact that partners are still a mite too touchy, perhaps you'd better let sleeping dogs lie. Another word of advice is always to be generous where money is concerned, for a helpful act now will build up credit for the future. 
GEMINI, You do get so awfully emotionally involved in your work, paid or unpaid, but you should leave your cares behind when you get home or you may fail to hear what family members are trying to say or do for you. Very soon partners will be coming to you with vital offers and valuable invitations and, when they do, you'll have to ask the right questions. CANCER The tantalising relationship between the Sun, expansive, optimistic Jupiter and Pluto, planet of ultimate truth, is triggering the artist in your soul. Your passions are stirring and you're looking for emotional outlets in the world around you. Allow lovers and loved ones to share in your excess of feeling. Begin a new cycle of domestic improvement as soon as you can. 
LEO, All those lingering plans to move home, or make any other drastic alterations in your family scene, will come to a head very soon. It's now time to make a firm choice: seize the chance for change or stay as you are. Only once in a while do your stars give you such a strong opportunity to resolve a financial blockage. Oh, and listen carefully to older relations. 
VIRGO, It seems that nothing can shake you from your pedestal. Only the most self-effacing and humble of Virgos can fail to realise that all members of your sign are blessed by beneficial fortune until well into next year. There's just one snag though - that you have to let other people take the lead. And that might not be easy! 
LIBRA, A partner, close friend or collaborator is becoming more energetic, impatient - and plain pushy: that's why you'd better work out a quick compromise! You'll reach a financial turning point mid-week, although what's important is not the amount of cash in your pocket as much as what you do with it. Save the end of the week for trips and outings. 
SCORPIO, Hang on tight: life is already turning into something of a roller-coaster, largely thanks to sensational lunar alignments. You may come to a full stop but then shoot off into hyper-space. Get on the launch pad now and welcome loved ones on board as well! And just to give you some deeper advice, try to get in touch with your more intense, long-term motives, especially those which relate to the dim, distant past. 
SAGITTARIUS, Contradictions, dilemmas and paradoxes flood your horoscope even more than in the past. The question you must answer now is whether you should tell what you know or not - and whether you should act on a hunch. As a true Sagittarian, you are better fitted to deal with such complications than most people! Close friends are talking sense, by the way, so listen well. 
CAPRICORN, You rely far more heavily than you imagine on advice from friends, especially people who have an intuitive feel for the situation if not an appreciation of the facts. Listen well and listen carefully. Mars' current position, by the way, indicates that if you look after others now, they'll return the favour when the time comes. AQUARIUS Emotionally you have nothing to lose and everything to gain, and you still have time to make that bid for triumph at work. Issue proposals, attend interviews, send applications and promote your own wares. If it's romantic adventure you're after, try midweek, perhaps because that's when your organisational skills will be at their best, but deep passions will also be present. 
TAURUS, Your solar chart's best feature is that it allows you the freedom to withdraw from stressful and angst-ridden emotional confrontations and enjoy pleasurable and passionate encounters. Much depends on your willingness to alter your perspective. Pay a little extra care to finances lest you throw good money after bad. 
GEMINI, Although there will still be times during the weeks ahead when you feel inspired, you must take note of planetary movements that are now advising you to be a little more down-to-earth and business-like. You'll soon be changing your mind, shuffling your long-range plans, so don't allow partners to pin you into a corner. READ | IPL 2020 Live Updates: Countdown to CSK vs MI opening match CANCER Many of the emotional and psychological undercurrents revealed in your current planets are very subtle and therefore tend to be overwhelmed by daily cares and concerns. However, I suspect that you are now aware that you have commenced, or are about to commence, a major new partnership cycle. 
LEO, Although your energy is at a peak right now, you must not imagine that this situation will continue for ever. You must therefore use the current surge of emotional power to reform and revitalise your relationships in a spirit of compromise, not confrontation. 
VIRGO, You are famous for the ruthlessness of your logical brain, yet at times like these, you must temper the cutting edge of your ideas with an understanding of the frailty of the human condition. In other words, don't expect people to deliver what is beyond their capacity or ability. READ | Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare review: Alankrita's film opens spaces and dialogue around the thorny subject of female desire 
LIBRA, You must now move without delay to patch up the financial situation, especially to compensate for any bitterness or hurt which has resulted from recent conflicts or differences of opinion. You're already feeling more buoyant emotionally. Next week will justify your optimism in a number of pleasant ways. 
SCORPIO, Today's watery mood gives you all the emotional support you need. Leisure and travel stars are now both beneficial and highly stimulating, although many of you may have to adapt your plans at the last minute, in order to cope with changing circumstances. Can you make some spare time? Please try! 
SAGITTARIUS, It's time to catch up with yourself. Areas of your life which deserve extra attention include higher education and legal questions, both of which may implicate relatives or partners. Any crisis in holiday or travel plans should now be resolved, while relations with children should be made your top priority. READ | As MPs test positive, Covid concerns may cut short Monsoon Session of Parliament 
CAPRICORN, When the phrase 'lateral thinking' was coined, it was exactly for the type of conditions that you meet today. Break out of old problems with radical, innovatory and revolutionary insights. And don't be afraid to look back to the past. It may be that the old ways were the best ways - and it takes a Capricorn to acknowledge that one simple truth. AQUARIUS The chances are that you will now have to lay down the law and let loved ones, partners and colleagues understand that they have definitely overstepped the mark. Yet you in your turn may bite off more than you can chew. One word of advice: don't neglect your health. There is no time like the present for getting - and keeping - fit. READ | Play Store drops Paytm for ‘gambling', restores it after scheme changed 
TAURUS, It is unlikely that anyone will be interested in apologising for recent hurts or withdrawing grievous allegations. Yet the manner of your response is a question for you alone to decide. You will shortly be off on a new path at home, one which could change your life for ever - and in more ways than one! 
GEMINI, Mercury, your planetary ruler, may be the bringer of wisdom. Yet there is an irresponsible side to this celestial body, and it is this which is dominant today. There will be little inclination to compromise, so why don't you stay away from controversial questions? CANCER This is no time for the thin-skinned and sensitive amongst you. The sensible members of your sign will be withdrawing into the safety of their protective shells, hiding in their personal emotional bunkers. If there's anything you want to do, in any area of life, from climbing Mount Everest to flying to the Moon, from daily routine, to your wildest dreams, do it now. 
LEO, Partners may be perfectly well-intentioned, but that doesn't excuse them from responsibility for some of life's biggest blunders. It is difficult to remember a time when the planets were less inclined to agree or see sense. However, there is one simple solution: keep smiling and remember that a sense of humour is vital. 
VIRGO, Today is frankly far from dull. You will be better placed than most to extract the unusual, interesting and stimulating snippets from the disputes and arguments which seem to be raging amongst friends, partners and colleagues. However, gentle Taurean influences suit your earthy Virgoan temperament and see you through unscathed. 
LIBRA, While you may feel under considerable personal pressure, these are just the sort of conditions in which your stronger qualities should come out. You really must now use all your considerable experience as a diplomat and fixer, to restore a level of peace and understanding. 
SCORPIO, Without in any way appearing to score points, you can now afford to say what has been on your mind for some time. It is possible, though, that nobody will take any notice, or even understand your message. And, if that is the case, why don't you just bide your time and keep your secrets? 
SAGITTARIUS, Clarity and honesty in your dealings with partners and colleagues over the next few days should ensure that you are not out of pocket. However, you must now rethink your financial plans. In love, partners could be excessively sentimental, yet sometimes you'll find their refusal to face the future deeply irritating. 
CAPRICORN, You must speak your mind and get a number of frustrations off your chest. Yet, at the same time, you should be prepared for other people to say things which you may not want to hear. This is the price you must pay for honesty. Unfortunately, you have still to find out that the truth as you see it, is not the truth as partners see it! AQUARIUS A deeply challenging planetary set-up indicates that an emotional tie remains a source of anxiety. Your work may suffer, as may your health, if you allow such fears and worries to continue. This is, by the way, an ideal moment for dealing with health matters, including your spiritual well-being. 
TAURUS, Go over all bills and demands for payment with a fine toothcomb. The reason is simple: at a time when the planets are indicating increased earnings, they may also cause extravagance and waste. You're still in a romantic mood, so if you want to wallow in sentimentality, go ahead - and don't let anyone put you off. 
GEMINI, Venus and Jupiter combine so benevolently that you may count on negotiations or transactions being finalised on time. Such is the helpful nature of the current moment that you may also assume that the results will be in your favour. Partners should back you to the hilt, but only if you do the necessary persuading. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER The world is in a state of flux and one particular tie or association is now being put to the test. It is not easy to know what to do for the best and you may wish to wait and respond to other people's initiatives. You should have made up your mind by the end of tomorrow. 
LEO, The answer to a current personal situation is well within your grasp. However, any optimism needs to be qualified by the recognition that other people may not share your perspective. You may be prepared for a possible reversal, only to be surprised by a sudden breakthrough. 
VIRGO, On the surface everything appears to be relatively straightforward. Yet the most perceptive among you are aware that intense and turbulent passions are boiling away below the surface. Happily, the Moon's transit through your chart increases your chances of worldly success. Follow coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
LIBRA, Your planets will be beneficial, benevolent and thoroughly enjoyable. We may look beyond light-hearted forecasts of pleasure and fun, and say one more thing about the current planetary line-up: you are being called to recognise the deeply spiritual realities which underpin your life. 
SCORPIO, Today's surprising planetary configuration could produce some startling headlines. Whether you are personally drawn into confrontations and conflicts depends on your level of self-understanding and self-discipline. You seem to be well on the way to a new conquest, perhaps a romantic one. 
SAGITTARIUS, Partners are bound to be more than a little blunt. Rude, some would call it! Yet you can take the odd rebuke or criticism in good part and accept that you may be partially responsible for whatever is now taking place. The only problem is that you still don't really understand what is making particular individuals so agitated. Follow coronavirus situation in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana 
CAPRICORN, It's a fact that someone close to you has been hurt recently, even if unintentionally. It is now in your interests to come up with a plan to restore goodwill. If you can work out a formula to put harmonious relationships on a long-term basis and protect your own interests, so much the better. AQUARIUS You may now feel even more like a square peg in a round hole, and your discomfort may be aggravated by people who are alternately reckless, impatient and unwilling to offer any concession or compromise. In love, take it easy, play it cool and wait for suitors and partners to make the first move. 
TAURUS, There still seems to be solid support coming from the helpful relationship between the Sun and Venus, your ruler. What you should realise now is that everything, including events which are frankly unwelcome, has a purpose. Keep an eye on your purse, as you could be misled or otherwise overcharged. 
GEMINI, If colleagues and associates have been attempting to discourage you from taking the plunge or accepting a tempting offer, the reason is not because they wish to hold you back, but that events have left them behind. The Moon's occupation of your chart sets you up for the top job. Can you take the plunge? CANCER Make the most of all those deep, colourful and transformative experiences which are taking place in your personal life and partnerships. However, some of you may currently feel rather reserved and suspicious of other people's motives. Yet if someone else has undermined you, they probably did so unintentionally. 
LEO, Taking a short-term perspective on current trends, it seems clear that lady luck is smiling on you. The only problems arise from your own failure to control your passions or take responsibility for your own intense emotions. You will soon discover just how much a close partner has been helping you - without your even knowing. 
VIRGO, You're in an ambitious mood, anxious to do your best and eager to take first place. Much depends on your general approach to partnerships. You should now be prepared to open up and acknowledge the powerful role that other people, not just close friends, have to play in your affairs. 
LIBRA, Jupiter is playing a beneficial role in the active sector of your solar chart, and has been for some time. Seeing that this planet's presence is being reinforced by Venus, it is clear that the prospects for a pleasurable holiday or long-distance adventure have never been brighter. Make plans now! 
SCORPIO, Some people are undoubtedly well-disposed towards you. Others are not. In either case your main task is to manage personal relationships with tact and wisdom, giving credit where it is due. When a tricky choice comes up you can probably both have your cake and eat it, going for every available option at the same time. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon's relationship with your house of marriage is a welcome sign that partnerships will move to a higher level. There are a number of issues which need to be handled with kid gloves, especially as emotional undercurrents could lead to enforced changes before very long. Tread carefully and with regard for everyone's feelings. 
CAPRICORN, There is still a chance that sensational planetary aspects will fire your imagination and enable you to make enormous strides. You still have some way to catch up if you are to make up for lost ground. Don't worry too much if partners are still stressed out. Life will be more relaxed soon. AQUARIUS Since Mars and Venus are sending a mixture of challenging and helpful aspects to your sign, you must expect partners to keep you on your toes. For those of you in search of pleasurable experiences, there are no limits. And, if you are hoping to fall in love, hang on; it could just be your turn next. 
TAURUS, Today's lunar alignment is designed to boost your psychological immune system, protecting you from whatever fate may throw at you. It should even be enough to get you through the week's domestic tension and family meetings. Your romantic mood is scheduled for a welcome shift later in the week, so take it easy for now. 
GEMINI, There is no question that financial pressure is intense, yet not all of you are passing through a cash crisis. Others are still buoyed up by an innate optimism and determination to succeed. It could be Friday before confusion or chaos is cleared up so, until then, you may want to leave vital matters to the experts. CANCER If ever there was a time to use your imagination, trust your intuition and amaze everyone with your breadth of vision, it is now, just as the planets are completing an inspired ten-year cycle. Don't worry about the confusion which seems to be coming into view, like some hazy sea-mist. It brings its own pleasantries and pleasures. 
LEO, Passions run high, but bearing in mind that love and hate are two sides of the same coin, the question is - which way will you jump? It is impossible to escape the fact that the wise will take the path of love. Within two weeks Venus, bringer of affection and ruler of seduction, will be safely in a fresh part of your chart. 
VIRGO, You should be ready to change the direction of your life. At any rate, the motivation to implement a number of positive improvements in your lifestyle is now pressing. Social contacts may strengthen your resolve, yet you should keep your diary relatively free and open to last-minute arrangements. 
LIBRA, A stroke of financial good luck should come as some compensation for the stress and strain of recent times. At least you can now see that your professional ambitions are likely to work out. A legal or marital matter moves to the top of your agenda, so see to it that whatever agreements are reached are in your favour. 
SCORPIO, You can afford to be confident now that the Moon shifts the balance firmly in your favour. Plus, a superb relationship between the Sun and your sign ought to get matters moving and enable you to exercise considerably more influence over your affairs than in the recent past. Do protect yourself against accusations or excessive demands from employers. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your spirit will be lifted by certain key developments. Specifically, you may be the fortunate recipient of a financial windfall, possibly one whose source is far from clear. Secret, generous gestures will work in your favour, and you'll soon come to realise that giving and taking work well together! 
CAPRICORN, There's still no let-up from dynamic planetary aspects. What can be said, though, is that the key to success or failure lies totally in your own capacity to organise your priorities and arrange your affairs. If recent events have taught you anything, it is that in the final analysis, you are in control. AQUARIUS So much has been concealed from you over the past few weeks that you may have given up hope of ever uncovering the answer to a particular question. Concentrate on what you can do to improve working conditions and don't let pessimistic people put you off. 
TAURUS, Take a deep breath in anticipation of the exciting times to come. You will be able to confide in partners or close associates and try to make them realise why you feel as you do. For your part, you can surely understand just why they should now be anxious. Happily, the Moon's gracious presence in Taurus offers full celestial protection. 
GEMINI, You're heading for prosperous stars. A tie-up between your second and sixth solar houses brings superb chances of an increase in your earnings, perhaps as a result of a long-held dream, or a vision of how you could help make the world a better place. You're also in a generous mood, so likely to end the week worse off! READ | China watching: President, PM, key Opposition leaders, Cabinet, CMs, Chief Justice of India…the list goes on CANCER It may be time to leave professional matters alone except inasmuch as they are closely bound up with your personal feelings. Everything in your life centres around your management of emotional partnerships, so give total devotion to people who have earned your support. And never imagine that you can go it alone! 
LEO, Personal success is now assured, but you must be prepared to take other people's feelings, hopes and desires into account. Then you may find that the current period is one of great fulfilment in all intimate relationships. A secret is about to come into the open, so make sure you have your side of the story ready. Explained: Hybrid warfare: What data they collect, why cause for concern 
VIRGO, Your perspective at home could change around mid-week, when you will come to see the importance of adopting a clear long-term strategy, rather than being over-obsessed by trivial or unimportant details. At work, co-operation is vital, even if it means your taking second place for a couple of days. 
LIBRA, It is probably still too early to assess the state of play either at work or at home. I can only reassure you that, in the longer perspective, the potential of the current period is utterly remarkable. When Venus and Mars shift their positions next week, friends and colleagues should come to your aid in magnificent style. READ | 5 PMs, two dozen CMs, 350 MPs across all parties tracked 
SCORPIO, One planetary aspect is assuring you that all is well. Another is about to sweep the carpet from under your feet. Your advice for the week is to remain on the offensive but to remember that magnanimity in victory is a great virtue. Keep an eye on travel plans, otherwise there's an outside chance you'll get lost! 
SAGITTARIUS, There's been an excess of emotion, even of deception lately. It may be just as well that others have shown themselves in their true colours, and that you know the truth. Hopefully, you were alerted with enough time to sever any dubious or potentially disastrous financial involvements. 
CAPRICORN, Astrological predictions may be the last thing you need right now. However, it may offer you a sense of the larger scheme of things to understand that you are currently in the middle of a planetary battle royal. It should also help to know that, by next week, the storm clouds will have passed by. READ | On list: Chief of Defence Staff; military, science top brass AQUARIUS Perhaps you should be thankful that so much has been, or is about to be, forced into the open. This is more than you could normally expect at such a time. All will be revealed when important planets align themselves with your house of partnerships next week. 
TAURUS, It's always pleasant when Mercury and Venus are creatively placed, if only because your social life will benefit. It's important to make a stand based on your principles, but not to criticise others for their beliefs. You must play second fiddle in family relationships, if only because partners' whims must be satisfied. 
GEMINI, Mercury continues its rapid passage, sending you a bumper crop of harmonious cosmic alignments. Romantic contacts are dominated by the need for discretion and a desire for secrecy. The entire scene at the moment is one of uncertainty, so do accept change when it comes, and make the most of evolving circumstances. Cancer Perhaps you have been let down by someone close. Actually, it may just be that your hopes and expectations were unrealistically high. There's an increasing likelihood of personal disputes, but nothing which can't be avoided with a little goodwill. 
LEO, Your stars are moving on and you must make an effort to see the world through other people's eyes. If you refuse to alter your attitudes you may fail to realise that you are being offered some very helpful advice. It may be time to say goodbye to a particular liaison which has outlived its usefulness — and to make space for another. 
VIRGO, It seems that you are entering a period in which you must pay more attention to partners' wishes. If you team up in a new partnership, the quality of life will receive a massive boost. The Sun acts fast to relieve pressure on professional matters, making it easier for you to enjoy social affairs. 
LIBRA, Venus remains in a profoundly businesslike position, and that's a reason why you are still bogged down with family and domestic chores. However, have you realised that there is now an entirely new way to go about your daily tasks? Delays at work will be offset by welcome family engagements, much to your relief. 
SCORPIO, Around the weekend, something will happen to make you think more deeply about your hopes and wishes. You might decide that it is now time to make a firm choice between different options at home. By the beginning of the week you will be well on the way to establishing yourself on an entirely new footing at work. 
SAGITTARIUS, Now that the Sun is moving through an encouraging region, you must turn your attention to those issues which are fundamental to your existence, such as the happiness of younger members of your family. Money affairs are still dominated by your overwhelming urge to spend, spend, spend. 
CAPRICORN, Now that the magical planet Mercury is so supportive, you must face up to those knotty financial problems, such as whether to spend on luxuries or necessities, and how to go about increasing your earnings. The one risk is of carelessness. So take care and keep up your guard. AQUARIUS Money matters begin to loom large now that Mercury and Venus are rushing on through your chart. You are not the best business person in the world, so be sure to take expert advice before committing yourself to major purchases. Romantic affairs are still shrouded in mystery. 
TAURUS, There's a strange restlessness around. In fact, travel is in the air, and you may like to promote an exciting future by going for the most innovative and unusual options. This is also a day to watch out very carefully indeed for the moral and ethical situation. Horoscope September 11: Check here 
GEMINI, Even though this might be a good time to express gratitude, you may be inclined to pull the rug from under the feet of those who have not helped you in the past. However, if money is involved, you had better be as careful as possible, otherwise you might sabotage your own interests. CANCER The strongest planetary aspect today is a lively solar pattern. This is the point at which you may dump old commitments and take on radical, revolutionary and high-tech activities. It pays to be optimistic, by the way, and faith in yourself could generate an aura of success. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates 
LEO, On no account should you become involved in any form of intrigue, or gamble with your future. Not unless you have taken all vital precautions, that is! Also, seize this opportunity to smarten up your diet and exercise and get in shape. That's the sensible option! 
VIRGO, Commonsense and a few hard knocks have done you a good turn, teaching you that associates' claims are often outrageous, having little to do with reality. From tomorrow, partners will once again be ready to listen to your extraordinarily wise words. 
LIBRA, You may be hard at work today but, if you have any time at all to pursue leisure activities, you should focus on those which bring attention and acclaim. If you're competing for a prize, certain problems should lie in the past. Oh, and don't be complacent on personal issues. Follow coronavirus situation in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana 
SCORPIO, You may use this opportunity to settle family arrangements, mainly as far as older people are concerned. Relationships with, and responsibilities for, children or younger relatives may assume a higher priority next week. In the meantime, enjoy yourself! 
SAGITTARIUS, The Sun and Venus now give you a nice idea of how cash can be spent to provide extra luxury or, at least, a little more comfort. The best solutions seem to be those which break with tradition, or which remove some of the pitfalls which are left over from the past. 
CAPRICORN, If you're still not happy with financial arrangements, you may give them a last little bit of attention today. Also, you should take criticism constructively, for there will always be something you can learn from it. And don't imagine that just because partners disagree, they're having a go at you. Follow US elections LIVE updates AQUARIUS It's a day for labour-saving devices. If you can possibly cut your level of tasks and commitments, if necessary by unilaterally dumping those which serve no practical value, please do so. It's fine to be sentimental, but not at the cost of damaging your current prospects. 
TAURUS, Venus, lady of love, is the planet to watch today, and by all accounts you should spare no effort in your drive to restore contacts with loved ones from the distant past or far away countries. You may have been stung by a partner's harsh words, but that only reinforces your determination. 
GEMINI, Do yourself a favour and spend a little extra on loved ones today. The way to someone's heart is through your wallet, so don't stint when it comes to little gifts and mementoes of your esteem. If you get someone on your side now, they could become the most loyal of supporters. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER The Moon's passionate presence gives you an emotional edge today. With just a little additional subtlety, you will be able to manoeuvre yourself into whatever personal situation you desire. A partner's consent will be necessary, but it should be forthcoming. 
LEO, You should do your best to put all bad feeling behind you, realising that what's done is done, and that you have to get on with the future. You may now feel happiest in the company of people you've known for a long time, or friends who are capable of arousing emotional intensity. 
VIRGO, Nobody is currently prepared to put in as much effort as you. Your main skill at the moment is to pick up on the vital details that tend to elude lovers and partners. But if you get too closely involved with colleagues then you might be infected by their amazing ability to create confusion. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
LIBRA, Your home and family commitments have been weighing on your shoulders for some time now, but all the signs are that you're  at the end of the tunnel. It's a marvellous moment to open new contacts, contemplate fresh options and make optimistic plans for the future. 
SCORPIO, Today's emotional alignments should convince you that the world is on your side, boosting your morale in the process. With your new-found confidence, you should spend at least some of your valuable time planning an emotional adventure. Also, keep half an eye on ethical issues. 
SAGITTARIUS, Given that today offers some wonderful business options, you may use the opportunity to be as generous as you can. You might still be suffering from doubts in at least one relationship, but these will diminish over the coming few days. An older relation's support should come in handy. Follow US elections LIVE updates 
CAPRICORN, You may do well to surrender the initiative and follow other people's lead. In spite of what some of you believe, you have had it your own way much of the time, and colleagues should now be encouraged to have a crack of the whip. You need to trust that they can succeed, and that may not be easy! AQUARIUS Communication has been a little rough lately, but you have a good chance now to cement a relationship and confirm your plans. You don't have to keep your feelings to yourself for very much longer. You may find willing listeners today, so choose your words with care. 
TAURUS, Cash issues are important, but possibly not as much as they may seem. The underlying questions still concern authority, the ways in which you cope with it and your ability to exert your own influence on affairs. You might have to stand up to somebody who has been trying to pressurise you unfairly. 
GEMINI, Try to run things your way, but realise that to guarantee personal success you must take on more responsibility and look after partners' interests as well as your own. The boundary between selfishness and selflessness is so narrow that it's almost invisible! CANCER There is much to be said for keeping your thoughts to yourself, especially where money is concerned. The fact is that your intuitive grasp of what needs to be spent, or invested, can be much better than that of the so-called experts. Take all opinions into account and make a fair judgement. 
LEO, The general planetary situation is still tense, and a great many people seem unable to distinguish fact from fiction. Your purpose is to maintain the balance, especially where family members are involved. Don't be too hard on people who misread your intentions. Perhaps they can't help it! 
VIRGO, You could be walking a tight rope at work. Play your cards right and success will exceed your expectations but, if you glance down, you'll be sucked in by the many distractions offered by lesser mortals. It's all a matter of striking the right note. 
LIBRA, Don't allow simple matters of cost to set the agenda. What is rather more important is to question the value you place on certain relationships, and to turn the tables on people who have taken you for granted. You need to be appreciated - and now! 
SCORPIO, There's a certain ruthlessness in the air, which means that you may be unprepared to give up without a fight. This is a lesson close associates, lovers and relatives will learn to their cost! You should complete all outstanding tasks as soon as you can, preferably over the next couple of weeks. 
SAGITTARIUS, There's a distinctly mystical mood around today, suggesting that you can dispense with the facts and concentrate on the underlying meaning and worth of what you want to achieve. A little quiet contemplation could do some good. But you may also learn the lessons that come with long-distance contacts. 
CAPRICORN, Venus and Mars are still in a sufficiently significant relationship to suggest that there's passion if you want it. Plus, a financial trauma should now be over. The worst threat to your prosperity could come from rash actions motivated by emotions which owe nothing to the present and everything to the past. AQUARIUS There's an old astrological law which states that no ending is possible without a new beginning so, as you jettison old commitments, you'll be opening the way for new ones. Romantically, by the way, there are still a few secrets to hang on to. 
TAURUS, It's an argumentative day, no doubt about that. Take a positive and fresh approach, looking upon this as a perfect moment to clear the air and make decisive choices. You should also realise that once you've committed yourself, there may be no going back. 
GEMINI, You are in control, but it won't always be easy to maintain a commanding position. Keep an especially close eye on all matters affecting the law, morality or long-forgotten disputes at work. You might have some big secrets, but whether now is the time to reveal them, only you can tell. READ | First time in 45 years, shots fired along LAC as troops foil China's bid to take a key height CANCER It's a time for breaking and challenging taboos. Mind you, you might not be too happy when other people offend your sensibilities. You'll have a great deal on your plate, most of it thrust at you by relations, partners and dependants. So, the last thing you want now is an unnecessary spat! 
LEO, The day's little crises will either be connected to profound issues like deep, buried emotional resentments, or purely superficial domestic questions, like trouble with the plumbing. Do your utmost to bring about a real, secure and lasting agreement, whatever it takes. 
VIRGO, There are bound to be one or two sharp words at work, and possibly a few concerns about domestic matters as well. Actually this is a useful time to remember that a little worry here and there is the perfect spur towards long overdue improvements. READ | Leading developers say will not release Covid-19 vaccines prematurely 
LIBRA, There are powerful planetary pressures urging you to gamble, perhaps to take an emotional risk. Whatever the outcome, you should remember the old maxim that it is more important to compete than to win. In other words, it's the travelling that is helpful, rather than getting there! 
SCORPIO, You may have difficulty coping with the facts, possibly because they're not clear, perhaps because you don't like what you hear. However, this may be one occasion when people you live with, or are related to, may be speaking the truth. That's a pleasant surprise! 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon's challenge to your sign indicates that you can indeed ask for assistance. The most important thing is to make every effort to talk about your deepest hopes and fears, coming closer to understanding yourself in the process. Once you've figured out your own motives you'll be able to rearrange your priorities. 
CAPRICORN, Social costs could be rising, but financial commitments can be eased with a little extra effort. Your best assets at the moment are quite probably a determination to get your own way, together with your ability to make as many friends as possible in the process. READ | Bengal: Gangraped, 2 tribal teen sisters consumed poison, says family; one dies AQUARIUS Your goal may be to persuade other people that you're right, but figures in authority, such as employers, may be willing to listen to reason. You'll need to use all your wiles if you are to turn a reluctant rival into a willing supporter. An old-fashioned leisure pursuit could be surprisingly enjoyable. 
TAURUS, Even trivial and apparently insignificant events could reveal the true gravity of your situation. And even if life is complex, you should do your best to see that there is some sort of guiding pattern. It seems that simple solutions are never that far away. READ | Jaishankar on India-China standoff in Ladakh: ‘Serious situation… need deep conversations at political level' 
GEMINI, You may be confused. In fact, seen from one perspective, the more bewildered and muddled you are, the better, for you'll have a chance to question your current commitments and relationships. And once you adopt a critical eye you'll soon identify areas which are ripe for improvement. CANCER Forget rivalries. Teamwork is essential, but probably because of what is likely to take place tomorrow, or the day after, rather than what may happen today. To that end, you should make sure that you have plenty of allies, especially if there's a financial connection. 
LEO, You may press ahead with professional goals, even if it seems that others are holding you back. Those of you not at work should concentrate on activities which bring you enhanced status and prestige in the community. What you're really after is respect. I hope you get it! READ | Actor Jaya Prakash Reddy passes away 
VIRGO, There are emotional pressures  at work, but one part of your horoscope indicates escapist tendencies. Do yourself a favour and plan a long-distance trip or, at least, spare some time for a decent day-dream! I mean, you really should spend more energy on yourself. 
LIBRA, Business and financial affairs may be complicated, but that's an indication that there's increased opportunity for the odd profit. It's therefore a suitable day for bargains for idle shoppers, and smart moves for those in the property market. Oh, and don't be put out by partners' rash judgements. 
SCORPIO, As much as family members or people you live with may be determined to go their own way, they will also be ready to listen. This is therefore an ideal moment to persuade partners that you are indeed right. But will they pay attention?  Yes, if you choose your words with care! READ | Explained: In India-China standoff in Ladakh, why Chushul is critical 
SAGITTARIUS, There's a fair degree of stress around at the moment. Astrologers blame that old planet, Pluto. You might want to look closer to home, and be aware of causes of discontent amongst people you live and work with. Take evasive action now and you'll thank yourself later on. 
CAPRICORN, Although the stars are pushing you this way and that, keeping you busy, the Moon's position offers you some time off. If you are especially determined, you may make this a day of leisure, putting duty to one side. If someone expects you to wait on them, perhaps you need to set them straight. AQUARIUS The world is moving your way, and you'll have a brief moment to seize opportunities. It's important to exert your own authority, especially at home. Perhaps surprisingly, family members may be happy for you to draw the line and define the limits beyond which they may not pass.

TAURUS, You are on to a winner. Jupiter, planet of optimism, expansion and success, is on your team, urging you to greater achievements. All you need to do is keep your feet on the ground and take care of the facts. When your natural skill combines with the power of the stars you are unstoppable. 
GEMINI, Nobody would blame you if you kept yourself to yourself. After all, there are times when even you have to go in for a spot of quiet reflection. Always ignore rumours and gossip, by the way for, if you act on unsubstantiated information, you risk damaging your reputation. CANCER You're now in the clear on a personal matter, but you may be wondering why certain other people still refuse to be pinned down. An unlikely romantic goal now begins to seem attainable - at last. And, if a partner doesn't respond to pressure, you may try persuasion. 
LEO, Although good communication is absolutely necessary, it's by no means certain that sticking to the facts will do you any good. You would do well to try and give reluctant partners a picture of how much better life would be if only they'd agree with you! They might not, though! 
VIRGO, You should spare a thought for ethical issues, like whether what you are doing is right and proper. If it is, all well and good. If not, make the necessary changes tomorrow. Romantic individuals, by the way, are about to receive an additional shot of passion. 
LIBRA, Joint financial affairs could do with a little attention today, so why don't you clear paper-work and settle any debts that are due as soon as possible? Once new creative projects are under way, tried and tested solutions should offer the best route to success. 
SCORPIO, The slow passage of planets through the most sensitive quarters of your solar horoscope suggests that, at the moment, personal motivation is everything. Employers may have to respect your desire to do things your way. But, if you follow your own path, it's even more essential that you do better than ever. 
SAGITTARIUS, There is a lot to be said for having a last burst of extravagance before the present financial cycle comes to an end. You would be wise to consult as many people as possible before committing yourself, though, for your judgement may not be at its best. 
CAPRICORN, Venus and Mars are still linked, and given that these are the planets of love and passion it follows that the emotional temperature is still high. You should aim for activities which are enthusiastic, optimistic and idealistic - and involve other people. AQUARIUS You'll have to take more notice of family obligations and domestic routine than expected. You should also set aside sufficient time to accomplish whatever is necessary. This is not the moment to stick your head in the sand, so face real life head on! 
TAURUS, You must by now be aware that moral and legal questions always need to be taken into account. So, if you're already formulating little schemes for the coming twelve months, check out the broader consequences, now. If you're looking for love, make the first move. 
GEMINI, Your planets gradually, but inevitably, shift into new regions which favour all domestic improvements. I doubt if you'll wait around for other people to do their bit. Instead I should think that you'll be giving the orders. But you'll probably still be involved in tedious and routine financial questions.

What you can and can't do, even in affairs of the heart, is therefore partly a question of what you can and can't afford. It would be a shame, though, if you allowed a shortage of funds to inhibit your sense of fun. At work, let other people know what's happening when you're good and ready. 
LEO, Your tougher, more ambitious side should be much in evidence. There may even be moments when you could be quite ruthless - but with yourself, as well as with others. You need to push yourself hard if you are to achieve your goals. It's unlikely that you'll stand for any nonsense, so partners should take care. 
VIRGO, The deeper message of the stars points you towards compromise, co-operation. With the Moon influencing your house of hopes and wishes, there can be no better time for making plans for the future. Social pressures will be stronger than ever, so have fun. You may have to take the lead, yourself, and make the practical arrangements. Read | After years, Govt plans new development bank for big infra funding 
LIBRA, For some time now most Librans have been caught up in family or domestic upheaval. These conditions are growing more intense, bringing greater scope for drastic improvements. In personal matters it is up to you to take the initiative, but you must realise that there will be bouts of confusion. 
SCORPIO, Family matters seem to be on your mind this week, and one of the best ways to use this week's excellent planetary energies is to imagine yourself this time next year. The next step is to decide exactly how you're going to get there.Put your pride to one side and seek help from those more experienced than you. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your stars are still pulling you in two very different directions, one speeding you up, the other slowing you down. The outcome is likely to be a feeling that you absolutely must do something personally fulfilling and worthwhile with your life. When you eventually decide which way you must jump, the results will surely be in your favour. Read | Steady rise in share of daily-wagers in suicides, 23% in 2019 
CAPRICORN, Your stars are in an adventurous mood. Let your imagination roam - and follow it wherever it leads. If you are on the ball, you will instinctively recognise just what your next step should be without even having to bother about the facts. Business partners will have good ideas, but only for long-term profits rather than a fast buck. AQUARIUS You could be in for a pleasant surprise over the next two weeks. While you may not like what you hear, there will be a lot of sense in what other people say.For this reason alone, you should consider acting on their advice. However, it is indeed out of character for any Aquarian to follow advice, no matter how well-intentioned. 
TAURUS, The Moon enables you to act with sensitivity and compassion, and this really is a case of least said, soonest mended. You may turn your attention to friends and loved ones who need your support, not a ticking off. Respect authority by all means, but don't be cowed by it. 
GEMINI, Discretion may be the better part of valour, at least for another twenty-four hours. At home you are likely to be in a crusading mood and, if aroused, you will fight other people's battles as if they were your own. Watch out that you don't shoulder too much responsibility, though. CANCER You may well feel that relations, friends and even business associates have been unreasonable, not to say unkind. However, over the next week or so, you will begin to see how you can gain the upper hand, especially in cash matters. If you do get an advantage, use it wisely. 
LEO, Your confidence is set to rise - a process which you can aid. If you abandon lingering pride, you will begin to realise that nobody has genuinely offended or slighted you. Perhaps you should give a partner the benefit of the doubt. You know it makes sense! 
VIRGO, Even current battles over matters of principle should do little to dent your interests. In affairs of the heart, you should concentrate on friendship rather than intensity and passion. If you're in an extravagant mood, you may now spend on pleasure rather than necessities. 
LIBRA, It's an imaginative moment, and artistic and creative types should redouble their efforts. This includes all of you to some extent, for what is common to your sign is an ability to perform every task with original and expressive flare. What's more, your valuable experience is also coming into play now. 
SCORPIO, It is perhaps too much to expect partners to compromise. But, then, why should they? You may have a very good instinct for what is right in general, but others have a much more appropriate notion of what is best in particular circumstances. Listen well, for you might hear something of value! 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a day for work. This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be tied to routine chores, but it does indicate that the most appropriate leisure activities will be those that keep you active - and involve new skills. In fact, you might find that a private interest could bring financial profit. 
CAPRICORN, Give a priority to pleasure today. It's definitely a moment to get out and about and all sporting and competitive types are favoured. You could well be ready for a quiet evening, or, if you're going out, some sort of serious entertainment. Old-fashioned pleasures could be most attractive. AQUARIUS Encouraging planetary aspects relate to money and to family affairs. If any sort of domestic spending is on the cards, even if you're in the housing market, the indications are exceedingly positive indeed. The best relationships are based around shared activities rather than raw passion. 
TAURUS, For quite some time you appear to have buried your head in the sand as far as one or two personal situations are concerned. With lunar influences so strong today, this could be a good moment to lift your head above the parapet and say what you think. 
GEMINI, For once your lively and controversial tongue may be stilled. In fact, it would do you a power of good to stop and consider all personal matters, especially family arrangements. The last thing you want to do now is reveal something which ought to be kept under wraps. CANCER If you have anything to get off your chest you should do so today, especially if friends are involved. Only if money is an issue may you prevaricate and put off the big day until tomorrow. Plus, of course, you don't want to offend someone that you rely on! 
LEO, You are being pulled in two directions. But which way should you jump? As far as anyone can see, you have done an extremely good job of standing your ground and, for that, you deserve full respect. Do yourself a favour and sort out a cash question sooner rather than later. 
VIRGO, This is an extraordinarily helpful day, even though it may be that the only matters you have to deal with are rather insignificant. If you have not yet bridged the gulf with a friend, do so today. And, if you have fallen out with someone, how about an apology? 
LIBRA, It could be an extravagant day, and the only reason for caution could be if you are spending other people's money. In love you need physical affection and reassurance and, at work, you should be considering promotion. It's about time that your true talents were appreciated. 
SCORPIO, It's an ideal moment to hold out the hand of friendship, even to people who in the past have been rivals rather than supporters. It would also be very useful to take a little financial advice before you are pushed into a corner - and make an embarrassing loss. 
SAGITTARIUS, A whole host of planets passing through challenging regions of your chart means that you must let other people seize the initiative. This is not obligatory, but if you try to take the lead yourself it may rebound on you, perhaps because you'll overlook certain fundamental details. 
CAPRICORN, You simply have to buy time in personal and romantic matters. You may continue to do your best, to make new friends, or to enjoy a current relationship, but you should realise that there are still many changes on the way. And, when they come, you might have to rethink certain long-term plans. AQUARIUS There are periods when you need to spend a little more time at home or dealing with important family issues. This is one of them, so hopefully relations will play ball. In love the lesson is that relationships need to be worked at - no effort should be spared! 
TAURUS, Your mood should lighten during the day, and hopefully you will become considerably more confident. You may even find that a mystery, perhaps quite a small one, will be cleared up to your satisfaction. It will be pleasant when the pieces of a very old jigsaw finally fall into place. 
GEMINI, There is much to be said for keeping yourself to yourself this afternoon and evening. Don't be unduly perplexed or alarmed by suspicions that someone is out to do you down. You may safeguard your interests by being as sincere and honest as possible. Read | Amidst calls for big push, govt spending up just 11% in April-July CANCER You should feel pleased with yourself for coping so admirably with many plans and proposals over the last few weeks, as even one or two setbacks haven't marred your general progress. Your task now is to take command by virtue of your emotional power. There'll be moments when you may be irresistible. 
LEO, Nobody can blame you if you haven't been entirely straight with the facts. The point is that not everything is clear, and much of that is due to other people's reticence in coming forward. In any case, romantic secrets can be fun; how about getting in touch with an old friend? 
VIRGO, You may turn your attention to travel plans and vacation arrangements, and also check out legal questions to make sure that you are on the ball. A family member far away may be trying to get in touch. It might help if you took the initiative. Read | Sahara red-flagged for fraud probe: Rs 86,000 crore from 4 crore depositors 
LIBRA, The new professional situation indicates that it's who you know that counts, not what you know. When achieving any major ambition, you should therefore exploit any and every personal contact to the full. But do so with good-will and your typical generosity of spirit. 
SCORPIO, One lesson you could learn today is to sympathise with other people's feelings. This is something you are quite good at anyway, but now you will have to bend over backwards to see their point of view. Actually, loved ones' ideas may be much more logical than they seem at first sight. 
SAGITTARIUS, So much water has passed under the bridge that you may find it difficult to remember the good times from long ago. As it happens, it's a fine moment to  repay debts from the past, including debts of gratitude. Plus, this is a day for companionship rather than raw passion. Read | Indian moves in Chushul sector aimed at forcing complete China pullback 
CAPRICORN, You ought to be aware that this is a crucial moment for personal relationships, and that you must now say what is on your mind. Even if partners' responses are not exactly what you want, they will be sympathetic. And that's a start! Who knows? They might eventually offer you their full support. AQUARIUS The passage of significant planets through sensitive reaches of your horoscope is a remarkable indication that now is the moment to achieve family happiness. But is such a thing truly possible? Perhaps not, but at least you can try. The worst you can do is fail, but you might just succeed! 
TAURUS, You are set to gain emotionally and financially. This is not the moment to turn the tables on people who have got the better of you, but it is a fine point at which to stop and consider what can be done when your chance comes. As I'm sure you understand, there's no need to rush, and every advantage in moving at your own careful pace. 
GEMINI, A new partnership will bring great good fortune at home. First, though, you may have to face a little disappointment openly and courageously. Deal with this well and your eventual success will be all the greater. Plus, if you're ready to experiment with new social activities you might find that you really do enjoy yourself. CANCER You should always remember that you were born under an ambitious sign and have much to accomplish. The moment you forget this and begin to imagine that you are always a sweet and sensitive person, you'll miss major opportunities and your hopes will begin to unravel. 
LEO, You should always take the long-term view and make a point of broadening your horizons at every turn. It is time to take care of your own needs and aspirations, making it apparent to one and all that you are to be toyed with no longer. People who think otherwise may be in line for a shock. 
VIRGO, It's all too easy to jump to conclusions. Have you considered the possibility that you have got someone all wrong? It may be that you have interpreted a partner's behaviour more in line with what you would like to be the case, rather than in terms of what is actually true. 
LIBRA, You should be less inclined to worry about partners' and relations' behaviour, for you will only get yourself all steamed up, and still be unable to do anything about it! At work, you should concentrate on getting on with people, as you might need loyal allies in the future. 
SCORPIO, It's a useful moment to consider your physical well-being, taking whatever decisions are necessary to get into shape with diet and exercise. There's no need to go to extremes - just be sensible. And while you're at it, pursue a new interest now, rather than putting it off for ever. 
SAGITTARIUS, Some of your basic qualities are strengthened today, especially your adventurousness and your willingness to experiment with new lifestyles and ideas. Don't be afraid to break out, just as long as you have taken whatever advice is essential to avoid failure and guarantee success. 
CAPRICORN, There are sound reasons why this is not a good moment to finalise relationship matters unless you are one hundred and ten per cent certain. It is, however, a perfect period in which to open yourself to new partnerships and make new life-long friends. AQUARIUS Whatever praise or approval you now receive will surely be well-deserved, but never let flattery go to your head. Plus, you should watch out for creeping complacency. If you rest on your laurels for a moment, opportunity may begin to slip from your grasp. 
TAURUS, You might be a little secretive today - and why not! It may be that other people are not ready to hear what you have to say, or even that you yourself do not yet fully understand your deeper feelings. In that case, you have all the more reason to delay. READ | India's GDP growth contracts 23.9%: What is the economics behind the math? 
GEMINI, Teamwork will serve you best. If you must press on alone, it may be that financial pressures are paramount, or that money is just generally on your mind. Your attitudes are likely to be somewhat conservative and tied to the past, but there is nothing wrong with that! CANCER It's a special time of year - again! This doesn't mean that everything will be easy, but it will be positive, which is an entirely different matter. Events of importance are lining up. All you have to do is make sure you have the skills and experience to make the most of them. 
LEO, Bear in mind that very soon you will be under powerful pressure to come clean. It may be that you have nothing to hide but, in any event, you should be as honest as possible, and that means being straight with yourself as well as with others. Choose your words with care. READ | Pranab Mukherjee, the Man for All Seasons, departs 
VIRGO, You are known to be cautious in many matters, but you can be surprisingly assertive when it comes to joint finances. This is one such time, and you should make it clear that your desires must be respected. You might be surprised how willingly others do your bidding if you ask in the right way! 
LIBRA, Listen carefully and pay great attention to partners' feelings. If there is to be any emotional friction today, early morning and mid-afternoon are the likely moments, which means that around these times you should be especially diplomatic. Spread a little goodwill and you'll earn respect. 
SCORPIO, There are some indications that this should be a busy day, but not overwhelmingly so. While you will have your fair share of chores, there could also be opportunities to duck and dive and generally opt out of unwanted commitments should you wish! Just make sure that you don't let anyone down. READ | Pangong south bank new flashpoint: India says took measures to thwart China 
SAGITTARIUS, The times are looking positive, although finance is one area where you could feel uncomfortable. To be precise, it's joint monetary matters which could be irritating, and you may easily come to resent domestic costs. Ultimately, it's your status which is more important than your bank balance. 
CAPRICORN, If there is any question about your priorities, family matters should come first. Even at work, you will do best if your profession in some way concerns the home, domestic matters or family relationships. In love, stand back and let others set the pace. AQUARIUS You must accept whatever boundaries or restraints are necessary to enhance your aims, and not create any sort of rumpus, especially where joint agreements are concerned. Your major goal now should be to build up your long-term security - no questions asked! READ | Before 2019 polls, BJP flagged 44 ‘rival' pages, 14 now off Facebook 
TAURUS, The social dimension is important, indicating that, even in matters in which you've previously done quite well by yourself, you should now consider asking for help. In the final analysis, you might need no more than moral support. You may be able to achieve everything else by yourself. 
GEMINI, You may give first place to worldly ambitions, but make sure they're mixed with a healthy portion of idealism. The plain fact is that, for some reason, self-interest is often served best if you do what's best for others. But, then, life's strange like that sometimes! Weekly Horoscope, August 30  September 5, 2020: Leo, Gemini, Cancer, Taurus, Virgo, and other signs CANCER Pleasant emotional influences should help you chill out.  In plain English this means that you may relax and count your blessings! On a purely superficial level, you can sort out legal affairs and travel plans, and make sure that the relevant instructions are absolutely clear. 
LEO, You may pay a little extra attention to joint finances, especially if domestic duties are spiralling out of control. However, there are few indications of worldly stress today, and many powerful suggestions that you can sail off into a private dream world. 
VIRGO, You may make social plans and celebrations a priority, and listen carefully to whatever close partners say, as even if their words are apparently nonsense, there is a deeper meaning which could do you a great deal of good. You also stand to benefit from chance events, so keep alert to the ebb and flow of fate. 
LIBRA, One very interesting and rare planetary aspect reveals the possibility of great generosity. It is, however, unclear as to whether you will be parting with your money or receiving someone else's support. The first option would seem more likely. 
SCORPIO, There are ways and means in which friends can be of great help. In fact, there is one person who could be more helpful than you ever thought possible. It may be time to ask others to tell you the truth, no matter how uncomfortable. You will know what to do when you get the message. 
SAGITTARIUS, For some of you it will be pleasant to stay at home, safe within the domestic womb. For others, it will be money that's important and, if you're in the housing market or otherwise dealing with property, events could move in a highly satisfactory direction. 
CAPRICORN, Sometimes your life is just not your own! Partners will demand your attention even more than in the past. However, if you can manage to make a subtle shift in your perceptions, you should start to pay less attention to loved ones' words - and more to their actions. AQUARIUS Money can buy your dreams, but only to a certain extent. This is why it will help if you continue to be as practical as you have learnt to be so far this year. You are living in this world of the here-and-now, not in some other mysterious dimension. 
TAURUS, I wouldn't be at all surprised if you were feeling decidedly uncertain about the future. Mercury, planet of thought, is not only behaving badly, it's aligned with a foggy part of your chart. The only thing to do is relax, enjoy yourself and wallow in your daydreams. Horoscope Today August 31, 2020: Aries, Pisces, Leo, and other signs — check astrological prediction 
GEMINI, Your social stars are trucking along nicely, which means that you're in with a chance of an extremely lucky meeting. Even better, someone who has been bugging you may finally back off. Do get out and about as much as you can this week, for very soon you'll become much more reserved, secretive even. Cancer You may be rediscovering your ability to get the better of other people, but only at the cost of losing some of your more delightful, softer, sensitive qualities. But, nothing comes without a price. Also, tie up loose ends at work, but don't expect an early agreement. 
LEO, Good fortune is your forte, but just at the moment something seems to be coming unstuck. Somewhere back along the line you made a rash legal decision or a dodgy ethical choice. There is still plenty of time to mull over the past and do it all better second time around. 
VIRGO, A recent financial advantage may start to look less rosy, although if you begin to see the cons rather than the pros, this could be a rather refreshing change. Actually, if you focus on the potential problems you'll be prepared if they arise, and pleasantly surprised if they don't. 
LIBRA, You may battle on at work and let nobody tell you you're not good enough. Also, prepare for a major professional advance in about two weeks' time, and lay the groundwork now — just in case. Romance seems to be far away, which may mean that love is to be found in foreign parts, or with a complete stranger. 
SCORPIO, I know it is a pain having to go over old ground, but it can also be good discipline. The fact is that there are chores that you thought were done with a long time ago which must now command your attention. Traditional methods of doing things seem to be best. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is certainly an expensive time, but it's also a week to spend with friends and loved ones. You're approaching a busy period, so do let your hair down, sow wild oats and generally enjoy yourself whenever you find the chance. Jupiter is still supporting good travel prospects, by the way. 
CAPRICORN, You're building up to a sociable period. This means you could be making important new contacts as well as mixing with old friends. It also means you must accept invitations you'd normally turn down, otherwise you have no way of knowing what you're missing. AQUARIUS Saturn and Jupiter are now your two most dominant planets, but I doubt if they will swing into action just yet. Give yourself about two weeks to prepare the ground before some of the most stunning stars of the year shake you up emotionally, romantically, professionally and financially. 
TAURUS, Time seems to be slipping between your fingers. You will very soon begin to imagine that the moment is now past for improvement in your home affairs and family relationships. In point of fact you will have a welcome second stab at the cherry within three weeks. Weekly Horoscope, August 30  September 5, 2020: Leo, Gemini, Cancer, and other signs 
GEMINI, Happily enough, it is an ideal period for country trips and family visits. Try to spend some time enjoying the peace of the mountains, the ocean - or the desert. It is rare indeed that your stars are so straightforward. A financial crisis should now lie in the distant past. CANCER You may still be feeling a little wobbly, but a shopping spree now looks like the ideal way to lift your spirits. Remember that when it comes to money, your horoscope speaks of quality, not quantity. It's not what you've got but what you do with it that counts! 
LEO, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are still aligned with your sign, each in its own way, and represents a combination that integrates action with knowledge and wisdom. Even apparently impulsive behaviour may therefore seem surprisingly sensible. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! Rhea Chakraborty case Exclusive: Officials say WhatsApp trail led to two drugs suppliers, arrests soon 
VIRGO, You will probably feel like keeping yourself to yourself, but you have sufficient quiet confidence to deal with whatever social obligations are thrown at you. This means that if you do have a busy social or family weekend ahead you should make as much spare time as you can for quiet contemplation. 
LIBRA, Your social prospects are looking consistently lively, but romantic Venus is now definitely going to make you think twice about whether a particular liaison is really for you. Don't feel pressurised by friends into doing anything which goes against the grain. Also read: Why New Delhi will miss Shinzo Abe, who gave new shape to Japan's India ties 
SCORPIO, The entire range of personal possibilities is about to be extended, much to your satisfaction. Your professional ambitions will remain on the boil, but you may also be making yourself more time for serious social gatherings, building up contacts for the future. 
SAGITTARIUS, Do yourself a favour and don't accept any unnecessary compromises. It is other people who will have to bend, and if they are incapable of accepting the real you, it is a sign that changes must be made. That doesn't mean, by the way, that you should be unfair. Also read: Religious sentiments ‘hurt', Assam Police bans TV serial for two months 
CAPRICORN, The parts of your chart representing business and possessions are strong, so shopping, spending and all types of investment should come top of your agenda. Joint financial arrangements require special attention and whatever is decided now will yield fairly speedy results. AQUARIUS You are increasingly finding yourself as the person who has to say 'no'. You didn't ask to be put in that position and it is not pleasant to think that others might come to regard you as a repressive force but, if they're sensible, they will appreciate your wisdom. 
TAURUS, If there has been a slight hesitation on your part, I suspect that this is because you instinctively realise that there is more information to come to light. There is everything to be gained from making the most of family discussions. Get something off your chest. READ | Sushant Singh Rajput ceath: As CBI questions Showik Chakraborty, father appears before ED 
GEMINI, The tendency towards financial complications is increasing, but today is better suited to clearing up loose ends than creating further muddle or confusion. We can now see the first signs of increasing harmony in a special family relationship, and that has to be good news! CANCER If you are feeling emotionally drained, then you are totally in tune with your stars and ready for a few days' rest. If you are on top of the world then you are in some senses defying your planetary cycles! What links these two possibilities? The need to be different - that's what! 
LEO, Venus, the ruler of raw passion, has temporarily reduced its influence over important areas of your life, and you may soon begin to feel that an emotional opportunity has been lost. But when it eventually returns, as it surely will, you will have a chance to play your hand again. READ | Covid-19 in Strait Island: Alert in Andamans over impact on 59-member Great Andamanese 
VIRGO, You will now begin to feel more open and confident emotionally. Within about three or four days you will also be prepared to reveal a long-kept secret, although you must pick your moment with great skill. The last thing you want to do is cause offence, even inadvertently. 
LIBRA, The overwhelming preponderance of planets in your solar chart is urging you to bare your soul. If you are forced into a corner, you might as well make the most of it and brazen it out! You may also surprise partners by saying the opposite from what they expect. 
SCORPIO, You have so much more to give than you normally imagine, and you should recognise that other people are now ready to accord you the respect you crave. All you need to do is to play your full hand, including the trumps. You might even have one last ace up your sleeve! 
SAGITTARIUS, There is so much going on in upbeat areas of your chart that it would be a shame indeed if your responsibilities prevented you from acting on impulse. It goes without saying that adventurous holiday stars are growing stronger by the hour, and if you can't get away, you'll definitely be missing out. READ | Delhi: 3-hour search by cops after woman mails UK PM Boris Johnson about suicide 
CAPRICORN, A personal problem may seem far less important than it did only a few days ago. In the emotional arena it seems as if a distance is soon to be put between you and a loved one, which may actually be a pleasant development! But do everything you can to avoid losing touch. AQUARIUS If anything, other people are about to become even more demanding. So far you have been careful to spare someone's feelings, but eventually your attitude might be, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Or perhaps you can just sit it out until they change their minds. 
TAURUS, There's a fair amount of emotion in the air today, and that's what accounts for the possible misunderstandings. If you're arguing your case you might do best to work from your gut reactions, but recognise that what is important to you may be meaningless to other people. 
GEMINI, The fact is that no amount of effort is going to make this a day for reasoned discussion, so please don't imagine that you're being your normal rational self. Instead, it's a time for poetry, imagination and love, so don't argue over trivial facts. CANCER Some of your stars are at their most intense, romantic and imaginative, so you may reach the clouds, but could be let down if your hopes are unrealistic. I have a feeling that it may be something in the news or on TV which exerts the strongest influence on your delicate feelings. 
LEO, The line-up of planets in your chart really is rather intriguing, to say the least, but if you're too self-centred you may be knocked off your perch. The Greeks had a word called hubris to describe the pride that comes before a fall, and this is precisely what you should guard against. 
VIRGO, It's an important time of the month, and one when you would quite honestly do best to check out what other people are doing. It might be a good idea to team up with like-minded souls in a group or society of some sort. A social obligation might have to be abandoned to make the necessary room. 
LIBRA, The whole point about today's planetary picture is that it creates events which are utterly unpredictable. There is supposed to be an uncertainty about the future, but this is really a rather good thing, for it enables you to change your direction and approach in both personal and professional issues. 
SCORPIO, You may give free rein to some of your classic Scorpionic instincts, in particular your love of the exotic, of mysterious worlds and spiritual investigation. It's time to travel to the ends of the earth, if only in your dreams. But if you can plan a round the world trip, then how about it? 
SAGITTARIUS, If you have any financial concerns at all, you must devote whatever time is necessary to sorting them out, and don't rest until every last detail is clear. As ever, legal issues seem to have an important bearing on your plans. Do you know your rights? 
CAPRICORN, Everything that happens now will evoke fond memories, perhaps of last year. However, while I have nothing against nostalgia, this is no time to dwell on the past. Contemplate the future with hope and optimism, even if someone close is behaving strangely. AQUARIUS Two parts of your chart stand out today, and the most important areas of your life therefore involve work and love, including your emotional well-being. In each you should think in terms of a completely fresh start and a break with the habits of the past. 
TAURUS, You're now entering a period when there's a high chance of misunderstandings, an extremely high chance, in fact. This is precisely why you must make a point of being open, flexible and ready to listen. You should also avoid making rash and unfair judgments. 
GEMINI, If you jump to conclusions you may get away with it now, but you may be caught out within a few days. Play it safe, especially if money is involved. If you have unlimited credit, fine. Otherwise, think again and wait until a partner has decided exactly what they think. READ | Pulwama chargesheet: WhatsApp logs, voice of Jaish chief kin mark trail in Pakistan, says NIA CANCER There are lingering pressures at home. If you begin to feel slightly disturbed, it's because of the Moon's emotionally unsettling effect. While this is undeniably a time of great opportunity, the best advice for most of you is to take a few days off and do whatever comes easiest. 
LEO, Astrology, as I always say, is a matter of making your own future, rather than waiting for what fate has to offer. Therefore, I would advise you to get in touch with your deeper self and consider the mystical dimension of your life, gaining insights which will guide you through the next few days. 
VIRGO, You should make whatever efforts are necessary to team up with other people, bearing in mind that individuals you meet now could become valuable and vital allies in years to come. Everyone has a story to tell, so don't reject potential partners out of hand. Opinion | PB Mehta writes: Politics of belief is different from one based on fact and interest 
LIBRA, Sometimes deep philosophical or spiritual issues are reflected in the most banal events. It might sound strange to say it, but deep cosmic uncertainty at home is paralleled on the planetary level by quite trivial problems. Watch the plumbing, for instance. 
SCORPIO, If you're due to travel over the next few days, pay excessively close attention to every single little detail. Give yourself plenty of time and allow for others' mistakes. If you're connected with higher education, your ambitions could be about to take a quantum leap forward. 
SAGITTARIUS, It now looks as if money will be the controlling factor over the coming days. In other words, what you do should be completely dominated by what you can - or can't - afford. It's probably joint arrangements that require the very greatest care. 
CAPRICORN, I don't think you need fear the prospects for muddle and confusion. In fact, all events will go well for you if you accept whatever happens with a good grace. Over the next few days, life will be a little like one of those crazy rides at the fair. READ | Jamtara is back, this time in a new e-SIM phishing racket AQUARIUS When all is said and done there seems to be a great deal to be gained from making the most of opportunities at work, even if it means taking on extra responsibilities. Stay calm if all around you people are losing their heads, and try to figure out your next step. 
TAURUS, All seems to be well at home. However, I suspect that many of you might be surprised to hear that in view of partners' often stroppy behaviour! What the stars are really saying is that even if you take a bit of a battering in the short run, the consequences this year and next will be in your own best interests. 
GEMINI, In some strange way the Moon is selecting you as a sort of cosmic revolutionary. What this means in practice is unclear, although I suspect that this is an ideal day to flex your emotional muscles and exercise your authority over colleagues and associates. CANCER The fact that the Sun is still forming a series of intriguing relationships with other planets could mean that you are gripped by a yearning that can never be satisfied. Realise that in some senses your dreams are just that - dreams! But if someone close to you should share them, then you're a lucky person indeed! 
LEO, Things are moving fast behind the scenes - very fast! In view of the fact that there's a certain restless influence in your solar chart today, you would do well to talk to everybody about everything as much as possible. That way, you'll steer clear of looming misunderstandings. 
VIRGO, There is no need to feel sat upon, hemmed in or exploited. Now that the Moon is influencing the very summit of your chart, you should make a point of being self-interested for a change. If you expect a little respect, then you'll almost certainly get it. 
LIBRA, In some manner which is not easy to understand, achievements in the big wide world will be balanced by an increasing sense of private uncertainty. One option is to stand back and let Fate take its course - and to step into action when the time is right. 
SCORPIO, I have a very strong feeling that a number of ambitions are about to work out as you always hoped they would, mainly because a series of separate planetary cycles is about to coincide. You might still be surprised by the change in a partner's opinions, though. 
SAGITTARIUS, There doesn't seem to be anything to be gained from going it alone. Indeed, I'd say that it was almost essential to team up with other people, even if that does mean letting them take the lead and set the pace. Your emotions may be a little uncertain today, but you'll settle down later on. 
CAPRICORN, You are communicating your message fairly well - but there's still room for improvement. Do yourself a favour and tune into all romantic possibilities, recognising that you can be as romantic about places, or even memories, as about people. Wallow in nostalgia and do the minimum work necessary to keep afloat! AQUARIUS You should spare as much time as you need to enjoy yourself and taste the delights of love. This is not a matter of being slack or self-indulgent, but of recharging your emotional batteries. Other people should recognise it as such - and give you the benefit of the doubt. 
TAURUS, The very fact that the Moon is making such a particular alignment with your sign means that, symbolically speaking, the world lies at your feet. You can do yourself a great deal of good by using every trick in the book to boost your self-confidence. 
GEMINI, To some extent your behaviour will be quite out of character, in that you will be inclined to keep your feelings to yourself, at least until lunchtime! Such will be the change during the day however that, by evening, indiscretion will be your watchword!

LEO, The one plain and simple fact is that your sign is now enjoying planetary influences which are more buoyant, optimistic and good-hearted than any since at least 1992, if not a great deal longer. Do yourself a favour and avoid utterly unnecessary and pointless confrontations. 
VIRGO, It's not always easy to broaden your horizons, but you could have a go! Consider the ethical and moral issues of your actions, and check out all and any overseas implications. It's a good moment to finalise travel arrangements, and spiritually it's a time to grow. READ | ‘Non-Gandhi Cong chiefs couldn't restore lost ground': Adhir Ranjan 
LIBRA, You can think the unthinkable, but do pay a little more attention than usual to financial affairs, especially as far as they concern other people. Fortunately, any fears or worries may now turn out to be no more than the vague stirrings of your too vivid imagination. 
SCORPIO, You will be obliged to take serious notice of good advice, even if it is not exactly what you wanted to hear. There is really no doubt about that, but you may find that there is almost unlimited flexibility when it comes to putting your plans into action. 
SAGITTARIUS, Pain is usually followed by pleasure and, having dealt with purely routine and unexciting tasks, you will be free to enjoy the fruits of your success. In many ways today should be like a miniature version of the good life: work hard this morning and relax this afternoon. READ | Phase 2 trials of Oxford vaccine could begin at 3-4 sites this week 
CAPRICORN, You are now in the build-up to the next major lunar pattern, an event of deep significance which will enable you to embark on significant new initiatives. If this makes you feel important, it should, for you will have a chance to take a prominent role in your community. AQUARIUS Your solar chart is not a good tool for monitoring physical well-being, but right now we can conclude that your very sensitivity makes this a perfect moment to move in and take whatever steps are necessary in terms of diet or exercise to boost your fitness. 
TAURUS, Increasing secrecy is the trend of the times. However, one thing you will be open about is your feelings, and this will help you to get on socially and at work. Employers and colleagues will be pleased to hear about new schemes towards the end of the week. 
GEMINI, Mars still seems to be the most important planet, which means that you'll be kept on your toes. However, at work and at home, you can afford to slow the pace as the week progresses. You're entering an extravagant period, so pay attention to underlying financial conditions. READ | First pushback: 23 senior Congress leaders stand up, write to Sonia Gandhi calling for sweeping changes Cancer You don't need reminding how emotional you are, but with assertive planetary patterns so strong at the moment, you might do best to bite your tongue and look the other way. Don't worry if prosperous prospects seem to be delayed, but concentrate on building up solid long-term investments. 
LEO, Fiery planetary alignments are about to grow more intense, so you can look forward to a more adventurous period. Higher education is favoured, as is long- distance travel so, one way or another, you should be expanding your horizons. Also, you must act only out of the most ethical and moral of motives. 
VIRGO, Partnership matters should now be settled, or at least put on a safe and established course. You must leave yourself free to deal with finances, especially all joint investments. At work, you should do your best to see that everybody sticks to their decisions. READ | First time, Dawood on a Pak list, but denial option open 
LIBRA, One thing looks pretty certain over the coming few weeks, and it's that you're going to have no choice but to pay very great attention indeed to other people's needs, wants and desires. At work everything depends on what colleagues say, at home on what relatives do. 
SCORPIO, Don't worry too much about professional delays or disappointments, and use any extra time to see that you prepare the ground properly for next time. Your romantic stars are thriving, thanks to the presence of that most beautiful and loving of planets, Venus. 
SAGITTARIUS, One by one the stars are swinging into a pleasurable, creative and spontaneous region of your horoscope. It doesn't matter whether your interests are high-brow or low: the only important thing is that you make personal satisfaction and fulfilment your goals both at work and at home.

CAPRICORN, The Sun, the Moon, Mercury and Venus are all secretly on your side, and will also challenge you to make a success of yourself in future. Pay attention to private needs first and, once you've sorted out your personal life, tackle professional goals or worldly ambitions. AQUARIUS If anything, your money stars are due to grow stronger. This doesn't mean you'll be showered with pennies from heaven. It does mean that you should snap up bargains, sort out your investments, pay bills and collect debts while you've got the chance. 
TAURUS, The most simple reading of your chart indicates nothing more than pleasant shopping trips. I have a feeling that superficial pursuits suit you best at the moment, partly because relationships have been so intense that you could do with a break. Ganesh Chaturthi 2020: Puja vidhi, muhurat, timings, samagri, and mantra 
GEMINI, Partnership and matrimonial questions should be given a priority today. There are few indications of stress, which is precisely why it is useful to make certain positive moves to heal old problems. You'd be so happy if people put you under less pressure! CANCER Before very much longer you will have to deal with someone who seems to be in a perpetual state of emotional tension. This is doing nobody any good, but it may be up to you, as a compassionate Cancer, to step in and help to heal personal hurts and upsets. Ganesh Chaturthi 2020: Wishes, images, quotes, status, messages, wallpapers, cards, and photos 
LEO, Decisive action is called for, but may not be possible. Actually, this looks like one of those days when you may duck out of all your commitments and dedicate your life to self-indulgence. Perhaps partners will agree that it's all for the best! 
VIRGO, The general state of the stars is deeply intense, and somewhat crisis-prone. I would not be surprised to see a number of Virgos walking around with feet firmly placed in their mouths, saying the wrong thing without meaning to! Helpful talks with relatives should straighten you out. 
LIBRA, A set of serious financial influences has been sending cash matters into a spin. Try to stop caring so much about money, and you might find that some difficulties are exacerbated by your own failure to get personal and professional priorities in order. Read | As with Pak, select China entities face extra visa scan 
SCORPIO, It's well-known that spending money cheers people up! This is just what I'd prescribe for you right now! Don't take risks, though, because an air of complacency suggests that you'll overlook certain essential details. You don't want to throw good money after bad, now, do you? 
SAGITTARIUS, Within twenty-four hours you will experience a planetary combination that conclusively ties professional and public prestige to financial prosperity. This is part of a five-year cycle dealing with deep, but positive, undercurrents, so don't expect instant results.

CAPRICORN, If you're not sure what's going on, it's because you're looking in the wrong place. This is a day to welcome mystery and intrigue. In the final analysis your day-dreams may mean more to you than so-called 'real-life'. They might even reveal the answers to tired old problems. AQUARIUS Professional demands are still so intense that many of you may be unable to relax sufficiently to enjoy the Moon's sociable functions. Even leisure pursuits will need to be competitive and ambitious. Whatever you do, whoever you do it with, you'll want to come top. 
TAURUS, Begin to check out the financial situation, especially if there are tricky domestic implications. I am afraid that there is still little you can do without permission and support from partners, so you must take their wishes into account at every turn. 
GEMINI, It may be tomorrow before you can make yourself understood, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't launch an attempt today! Happily, partners and colleagues will be increasingly prepared to listen. You never know - someone who once stood in your way may soon offer you helpful advice. CANCER There is much to be said for pressing on with work and routine chores, even when all the indications are that you will be increasingly impatient and dismissive of small daily duties. That's fine as long as you have experienced people doing your bidding. Otherwise you'd better be more circumspect. 
LEO, Finally, other people will be able to have their say, and you will be ready to heed good advice. You may be more prepared to hear what children or younger relatives have to say than some other family members. You'll build up credit, and may even receive a major favour. 
VIRGO, One possibility not mentioned so far this week, is a chance of unexpected short journeys, perhaps a nostalgic trip, probably for a romantic purpose. Today's stars shift the emphasis towards family visits, or at least communication with people you live with: get talking! 
LIBRA, It's been a confusing week for many people, but today you can set a lead by restoring good and clear communication. One way forward is to get more involved in a charitable exercise, or pursue activities which are designed to make the world a better place. 
SCORPIO, You're getting mixed messages, so by now you may be feeling a little perplexed, even for a Scorpio! Your planets are still urging you inexorably towards emotional confrontation, but try not to be totally uncompromising. There may be a great deal of truth in what a partner has to say. 
SAGITTARIUS, Quite a number of people have been suffering recently, many of them emotionally. Regardless of other considerations, your celestially-inspired task today is to begin to pick up the pieces. You could be much closer to solving a long-term question than you think. 
CAPRICORN, You are not normally considered secretive, but that doesn't mean that you don't like to keep things close to your chest. Other people must remember that they have no right to take you for granted, or to examine your very private and intimate affairs. AQUARIUS Pleasant social influences reign for the next forty-eight hours, so life should be just as you like it. You may be in dire need of relief from more pressing emotional complications, including some which directly involve your work. Stay cool: they won't last for ever! 
TAURUS, Sometimes doing something is worse than not doing anything! If you refuse to listen to partners, or attempt to challenge them on their own ground, you will only magnify your problems. You could do yourself a favour, take an ethical stand, and try to explain the difference between right and wrong to colleagues. 
GEMINI, A splendid relationship between one set of planets aligned with your house of business, and another related to your house of work, means one thing: you must now make one final effort to increase your income. Or at least, you should steer clear of money-wasting activities. Explained | What serosurvey results imply CANCER The Sun relates to magical Mercury, serious Saturn, mystical Neptune and secretive Pluto. You're therefore on a sort of emotional and creative helter-skelter, meaning that, true to character, you will pay very much more attention to your feelings than to the facts. 
LEO, Jupiter is now beginning to complete a series of aspects which indicate that you will be one of the first to feel the benefits of changing conditions. If you have a problem over the next couple of weeks then it could be impatience, so see to it that every gain you've made is guaranteed. 
VIRGO, An emphasis on serious, deep thought helps students, people attending interviews and anyone with long-term proposals to make. The best approach requires a devotion to the truth and a high regard for colleagues' feelings. A little selflessness goes a long way towards helping you achieve your goals. READ IN HINDI | Horoscope Today, August 20, 2020 
LIBRA, You are on the verge of making a major breakthrough, and may finally have the resources, or the courage, to implement a number of significant domestic reforms. Emotionally, you will at last come into your own, but you might have to leave one personal question unanswered. 
SCORPIO, It is now almost time to begin new enterprises, whether romantic, professional or domestic but, according to all the ancient rules of astrology, you may do best if you can pause just a little while longer. You can watch, wait, and pick your perfect moment. 
SAGITTARIUS, When the Moon changes its position, you should begin to feel much happier, and also to see the truth underlying a number of recent emotional complications. Don't abandon your dreams, but do put them into context. You might realise that you misunderstood somebody's perfectly reasonable suggestions. 
CAPRICORN, You probably imagine that it's a long time since other people did you any favours, but, in some curious manner, even those who have tried to do you down in the past, will now give you a helping hand. A reversal of fortune should work out to your advantage! READ | Sushant's family on SC verdict: All those involved in the dastardly crime will be brought to justice AQUARIUS Powerful stars motivate you to assert yourself and insist that other people obey you, not the other way round. However, never imagine that the person who makes the loudest noise now will win out in the long run. It can be the quiet people, who are never noticed, who come first. 
TAURUS, No doubt you feel pulled between two emotional options, trapped, perhaps, between the devil and the deep blue sea. Hopefully, today's fresh lunar alignments should help you make up your mind, or at least arrive at some sort of temporary solution. READ | Horoscope Today, August 20, 2020 
GEMINI, There is a great deal to keep you busy, and a good thing too! The main consideration is probably that you tackle underlying problems, but don't push yourself so hard that you end up exhausted. You'll be no good to anyone if you're flat on your back. CANCER Passionate influences reach a peak very soon, but that doesn't just apply to matters of love - or of hate. Many of you will be deeply involved in a purely private project, rather then connected with another person. You're on a quest for perfection, but will you ever find it? Perhaps not, but at least you can try! 
LEO, Venus and Jupiter have been boosting your prosperity, although the absence of pressures to save and conserve means that you are now as likely to be in the red as in profit. This could perhaps be one cause of current domestic friction. Perhaps a partner can help! 
VIRGO, This hardly looks like a day for small talk, and even those Virgos who like cracking jokes will have a profound point to make about the human condition. You can maintain a diplomatic silence under pressure, and only speak when you're truly confident. 
LIBRA, When financial matters come to a head, the causes may lie in the distant past, even as far back as three years ago. By the same token, your current actions may have repercussions for the long-term future, so be positive. But don't imagine that you can get away with anything! 
SCORPIO, The Sun and Moon are just two celestial bodies making repeated alignments with intense Pluto, by now a regular fixture in your calendar. In all matters, personal and professional, there is absolutely no room for compromise over principles, at least, not just yet. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may be slightly disturbed by various mysteries or half-understood developments. Avoid rumours and unfair suspicions, and take the opportunity to dream a little. There is much to be said for indulging your fantasies. After all, what is life without dreams to strive for? 
CAPRICORN, Although your social stars are bright, there is a vague chance that certain people will indulge in rumour-mongering and back-biting. Such types are to be ignored and avoided, for you have higher things on your mind. Others may not listen to you, but that is their problem. AQUARIUS There is no room for time-wasting at work. Neither should you be surprised if employers or people in authority are over-emotional, and for your own self-protection you should tread very carefully. You don't want to give the wrong impression, especially not now. 
TAURUS, There is a great deal to be said for putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Only then will you see just how they are feeling, and therefore also what you can do to help. Don't worry if professional burdens increase - it should be purely temporary. 
GEMINI, Mercury and Saturn continue to form one of those downright sensible planetary aspects that encourage you to put frivolity behind you. Work out exactly what you want and how to get it without further delay. The more initiative you show, the more you'll impress other people. Follow coronavirus India LIVE updates CANCER There'll be a steady build-up of passion during the day, but this doesn't only just refer to relationships. You may, for example, be enthused by a creative venture. Or it may be children and younger relations who are letting their emotions out all over the place. 
LEO, There are now serious indications that substantial domestic changes are imminent, including anything up to a move of home. What is certain is that family members will need placating over the next few days. You might have to say sorry, even if you don't want to! 
VIRGO, You have a great deal to be thankful for, not least of which is the care that other people have taken to help you at various stages in the past. What you must do now is pay your debts, and acknowledge all such assistance, perhaps even offering a favour in return. READ | Embassy in Moscow in touch with developer of Sputnik V 
LIBRA, The dominant romantic influences are still discreet, even secretive. Perhaps someone close to you is not ready to say what they mean. What seems to be absolutely clear is that only when other people are ready to listen, will you be able to confess your real feelings. 
SCORPIO, Get ready for the next lunar phase by clearing the decks of all unwanted chores and outmoded relationships. Above all, take domestic duties seriously, and don't blame family members for holding you back. It may well be that they have been doing their best to assist you. 
SAGITTARIUS, Although the professional situation continues to be broadly helpful until well into next year, both for you and for partners, the one thing you can no longer do is rely on personal contacts to help you through. Increasingly,it will be up to you to shape your future direction. READ | Explained: Who can fly abroad, and where 
CAPRICORN, It's time to stop being the dull, materialistic Capricorn of popular myth and develop those imaginative, inspired and intuitive qualities that most astrologers fail to mention. For the next five days you may day-dream to your heart's content. You never know - you might even come up with some brilliant ideas! AQUARIUS This is no time to be ashamed of your ambitions. The fact is that being part of a team may not be the right thing at the moment. There's no reason to cause waves, but you must follow an individual course, and partners just have to recognise that you have needs which you must fulfil. 
TAURUS, On the whole it's a good day for routine work, so there are no big surprises there. On the other hand, it's a week for grand romantic passion, so slip out of your Taurean taboos and inhibitions now. It's time to show that you care! Even if you surprise someone! 
GEMINI, The most significant factor today is the movement of your planetary ruler, Mercury, aligned with your house of relationships. This is a firm indication that from now until the very end of the month you must, at all times, remain in dialogue with partners on all matters. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER As from today you will begin to think anew about working commitments, but I suspect that you have a great many passions and pent-up feelings to release before you can formulate your thoughts coherently. You need to get your head and your heart working together. 
LEO, So much hinges around home and family relationships that it is difficult to imagine your achieving anything without the benefit of your unique past and background. For some of you it will be memories that dominate your actions, rather than actual people. 
VIRGO, One factor in your chart suggests domestic purchases, another endows common sense. Don't expect excitement, but do realise that the more you accomplish now, the more time you'll have to yourself later on. You may also expect a favour to be repaid, although don't hold your breath! Follow coronavirus situation in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana 
LIBRA, Today's lunar prospects are bound to give you more confidence but will, from time to time, bring up slightly painful memories. Actually, this is a perfect moment to assert your will in family relationships. You never know - perhaps partners will respect you more for your determination. 
SCORPIO, If you can't put your finger on exactly what's going on, don't worry - you're almost certainly in good company. Only when other people have made you feel that you are wanted and valued will you be able to look back and see what you have been going through. 
SAGITTARIUS, The requirements of social stars don't just mean that you'll be mixing in friendly company. Even at work, it will be your ability to get on with people and operate as part of a team that determines your success. But, at home, you need to give people a good reason why they should do what you tell them! Follow coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
CAPRICORN, In the romantic department it may be too late to grasp a distant opportunity. Perhaps it was all an illusion in any case. On the other hand, quite aside from daily ups and downs, this is a week to bring out and develop your creative fantasies. AQUARIUS There should be a sense of triumph in your life this week, almost as if you are about to get something right when other people have for so long doubted your true qualities and talents. You will soon prove yourself, so stick to what you know to be right. 
TAURUS, There is much to be said for pressing ahead with every routine chore necessary for your own survival. There is also a welcome absence of difficult planetary aspects, which means that you may clear the decks of all unwanted and unfinished business — as soon as you can. 
GEMINI, If you can shift various chores and duties until next week, there seems to be no good reason not to do so. About the only responsibilities which do seem hard to deal with concern children and younger relations. You might even do well out of being more light-hearted yourself. Read | Citing business reasons, Facebook opposed action on BJP-linked hate posts: WSJ report Cancer Mercury now settles into a harmonious relationship with Venus, an almost perfect indication of passionate encounters and intimate, almost cosy, times with loved ones. Give the top priority to pleasure and remember that, if you enjoy yourself, so will others. 
LEO, You may expect unscheduled journeys and should anticipate that the reasons will be for business, or at least for some other serious reason, rather than for pleasure. Your general approach should be solid and sensible, so don't follow idle distractions. 
VIRGO, It looks very much as if it will be how much things cost that now determines what you can and can't get away with. It would be wrong, though, to place a cash value on personal relationships which require rather more serious consideration, but then you always knew that. Also Read | Blue fades but MS Dhoni will linger in yellow 
LIBRA, The Moon is now set to gallop through your chart at a fair old pace. Interestingly enough, you can now plan for romantic success, so a partner must come to terms with the fact that you are the boss. Cash questions  should clear up very soon, so don't panic. 
SCORPIO, The most perceptive amongst you will already have realised that the inevitable must happen, while the wisest individuals know that when it does it must be welcomed. One eventual outcome should be vastly increased security at home, so take the necessary steps. 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus makes an alignment that is quite extraordinary, though very fleeting, bringing with it amazing emotional contacts with the past. You're hoping for the best and that means someone really should return from your old life, hopefully bringing fond memories. Tavleen Singh writes | Past 12 months may be defined as India's year of hatred 
CAPRICORN, This should be a rather satisfactory moment for all professionally-minded people. The basic planetary disposition is favourable for most of the day, raising the possibility of friction only later this evening, but then only if you haven't set time aside to relax. AQUARIUS You're now entering a new phase during which the only promises or commitments you make should be ones you are prepared to keep. Many active and lively individuals are now bringing legal questions to completion, or at least to a more satisfactory stage. 
TAURUS, While it is true that the general planetary trends are on your side, I do feel that this is the time for measured responses. In spite of what astrologers often claim, you can blow up, but this is perhaps not the best time to do so. There's nothing to be gained from blaming the first person who crosses your path. 
GEMINI, You should listen to other people instead of lecturing them. When partners are given a fair hearing, they may contribute some extremely useful advice. It is now the moment for you to realise that your ideas must be backed up with true facts. The time for bluff is over. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER The financial situation is looking more and more favourable, although you would be foolish to take a large risk. You must always keep sufficient in reserve to cope with any contingencies. You might do well from mixing business with pleasure. 
LEO, You may either be putting in some overtime, or otherwise doing more than is necessary. But don't forget important leisure activities; stay active, keep moving and take steps to develop a new interest. If you go for a confrontation, you must take your share of the responsibility. 
VIRGO, You can fulfil your social engagements if you wish, but your stars are looking so monastic that the ideal way to spend the next few days would be far away on a spiritual retreat. One way or another, you must make more time for yourself, but family members overseas do offer a fruitful point of contact. Follow coronavirus situation in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana 
LIBRA, Leaving to one side more profound issues, this is a day for retail-therapy, window-shopping, browsing through catalogues and generally involving yourself in the consumer society. A generous gesture will help happy social gatherings go with a swing. 
SCORPIO, What transpires between now and eight weeks' time will totally transform many of your opinions and attitudes - and some of your decisions. Hopefully, a few hard knocks will also help you smarten up your act and enable you to see just how well-off you are in many respects. 
SAGITTARIUS, Part of your horoscope is shouting about fun, another is pulling you towards spiritual and philosophical dimensions. The solution would seem to be to enjoy yourself but never lose sight of the meaning of life. A loved one from far away is about to get in touch, so wait for the news to arrive. Follow coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
CAPRICORN, There is some way to go before you need experience any further shake-up. I know that some of you are still feeling bewildered and confused, but such feelings will pass, especially if you realise that you must get on with ordinary life. Plus, someone will surprise you by coming up with the best advice. AQUARIUS While it's true to say that your solar chart is generally light-hearted, this is a very appropriate moment for serious discussions and important choices which will affect your practical affairs for a very long time indeed. A partner has the answer to an old question - if only they knew it! 
TAURUS, There are so many planets affecting your home and family background that it is difficult to know where to start. As a matter of interest, any enquiry into your origins will help you understand your present situation. You'll gain insights into your behaviour by finding out what your parents or grandparents did. 
GEMINI, I know that some Geminians prefer a good read to the endless chatter for which your sign is renowned, but even you will be growing more verbal by the day. You are shortly to earn your reputation as the poet and orator of the zodiac. You'll be able to persuade virtually anyone that anything is true. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER It is never easy to let go, but that is precisely what you must do. The point is that only if you open space in your life for new things and people to enter, will you then go on to find the happiness you deserve. What a partner really needs now is your trust. 
LEO, The tally of helpful and hopeful planets at your beck and call is now four, so you really have no excuse for not making the best of things, even if others have a head start. Look far afield for inspiration today, and try to find new solutions to age-old problems. 
VIRGO, Your solar chart is in a distinctly discreet and retiring condition. While you are quite entitled to keep your thoughts, feelings and activities to yourself, be open and upfront in all joint financial arrangements. But do enjoy a secret friendship or flirtation. Follow coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
LIBRA, Your deep need for partnership has been discussed often enough in the past, so the only observation we need make now is that, while everything is broadly going extremely well, this is just the sort of time when you drift into emotional dependency without even realising it. 
SCORPIO, Given that a financial question should now be settled, and that family affairs are moving slowly on an assured course, there is little going on in your chart that doesn't affect your job. Many of you are soon to become officially registered workaholics! 
SAGITTARIUS, Take a break from all pressing and urgent matters, with the sole exception of developments concerning the law, higher education or travel. Adventure, by the way, is looming on all fronts and, at last, you may see your way to exploring an old ambition. Follow coronavirus situation in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana 
CAPRICORN, Given that yours is a sign strongly associated with business, we are surely about to see you coming into your own. It doesn't matter whether your approach is strongly materialistic. What matters most is your motivation and sincerity. Do the right thing and others will support you. AQUARIUS When we look ahead and see that the possibilities include either marriage, a new and wonderful friendship, or a partnership that will transform your professional hopes, we can see just how important other people are to your dreams. Even at work, relationships matter most. 
TAURUS, There is some way to go before you can truly call yourself free of the past, indeed in many cases this may be an impossible goal. What does seem to be certain, though, is that memories of the present time will overlay thoughts of long ago to the extent that these may be effectively forgotten. 
GEMINI, With so many irons in the fire it is hardly surprising that you are hard-pressed to know what to do next. If at all possible, you should attempt to discriminate between choices, meetings and trips which are vital and those which may be put off until tomorrow. CANCER There is no time for a backward glance. You are famous for your determination to hang on to the past, but now you must realise that there is no going back. All you can do is resolve to create a wonderful future. You can also decide to do your best by someone who has been so loyal to you. 
LEO, There is now every chance that you will come through with flying colours. However, if you are to be derailed, it will be because you refuse to accept the need to initiate radical change and go for increased efficiency in all work and routine tasks. 
VIRGO, Entertainments should be unusual, eccentric and odd, not to say completely outrageous. If you go for the same old thing, you'll never know what you missed, so you may disregard all rules, regulations and taboos. Perhaps it's time to set your own limits. 
LIBRA, If a move of home has been mooted, or any similar domestic upheaval considered, today is the day to begin to make it a reality. Initiate any worthwhile steps as soon as you can. Also, watch out for gadgets that seem to be developing a mind of their own. 
SCORPIO, Sometimes you just have to stick up for yourself, and you seem less ready than ever to compromise. Now, everyone who has any sense knows that you are right, but it still holds that if you fail to notice changing circumstances, all you have striven for will come unstuck. 
SAGITTARIUS, Although some of the direct alignments with your sign are weak, the overwhelming nature of current planetary patterns is favourable, more so indeed than at any time since last month! As you can see, you're therefore now operating on a very significant monthly cycle. 
CAPRICORN, The pressure towards some sort of separation is overwhelming, but is so general that it is impossible to be more specific about what sort of connection you're going to give up. It may be, for example, that all that is required is a clean break with the bad habits of the past. AQUARIUS It is rare that every single member of your sign is affected by a very major planetary transit at the same time, yet that is now the situation. While agreeing that the present moment is significant though, only you can decide whether you must put your plans into effect now or later. 
TAURUS, Approaching stunning planetary movements are casting a shadow backwards in time, one which may get you moving with surprising speed. If you're travelling, don't be surprised if you encounter a spot of chaos over the next three days, but try to make the best of it when you do! 
GEMINI, You must take great care of all joint financial arrangements, and don't let anyone put you off your stroke. The best purchases and investments, at the moment, are either radical or high-tech, which gives you quite a choice. But your guiding principle should be whether your actions benefit everyone - or just you. Read in Hindi: Horoscope Today, 12 August 2020 CANCER There's a sense in which your current stars are electrifying. This means of course, that you may receive a shock any time over the next three days. But, rather than dwell on any unexpected events, why don't you take control and spring into action? 
LEO, There is one final word to be spoken, one last thought to be had, before you come out into the open. You have been very adept at revealing your feelings while concealing your thoughts, a display which has left others feeling a mite confused. Follow Coronavirus India LIVE Updates 
VIRGO, Children and younger people may need careful handling over the next few days, yet don't criticise anyone for being difficult. Instead, help them express their feelings and give direction to some very unusual and original aspirations. The differences between you can be the very qualities which make for a dynamic relationship. 
LIBRA, The domestic situation is looking uncertain and unstable, but you may have no warning of someone's intention to up sticks and move on. The best thing you can do is encourage others in their adventurous desires. You might even be able to enjoy their success at second-hand. 
SCORPIO, To start with, you need to look at what is right and what is wrong. Having checked out the ethical questions, you may now throw yourself wholeheartedly into professional achievement. There is everything to be gained from letting rip and working twenty-five, or even twenty-six hours a day! 
SAGITTARIUS, Hopefully you have thought in great detail about your financial commitments and checked out the most tiny minutiae. Only if you are word-perfect will you transform a current opportunity into a massive profit. You may also have to convince a family member that your plans are right for them as well.

CAPRICORN, It is unclear whether it is you or a close partner who is pulling back from a number of ties. If it is them, then they are probably unconsciously doing your unspoken bidding in some strange sort of way, as if it's you who is secretly reluctant to make a commitment. AQUARIUS You might disregard all rumours and suspicions as time-wasting cul-de-sacs. But do, however, devote as much time as is necessary to investigating strange mysteries and figuring out just what makes someone tick. If a partner seems confused, it's because they are! 
TAURUS, Delicate planetary alignments provide a veil which may obscure the stormy emotions beneath. An additional social gathering or romantic encounter will certainly take your mind off more pressing problems. Any temporary diversion o distraction will cheer you up. 
GEMINI, You seem to have a better idea of what went wrong, and how to put it right. Your will to succeed will be strong, but what you need out of a work situation varies. Today, it looks as if your real priority will be a sense of community the feeling that everyone is working towards a common goal. CANCER Your lunar alignments really are splendid today, a fact which should more than compensate for recent disturbances or upsets. You are still in danger, though, of letting your feelings run away with you. If you're too sensitive then you might imagine that someone's trying to get at you, even though they're not!

LEO, Something still seems to be very secret, so much so that even you might be in the dark. It may be too late to stop one particular course of action, but firm agreements may be deferred for another five days. You have to wait until you're absolutely certain. 
VIRGO, The entire situation is in a state of flux, but you may find that when people change their minds it doesn't affect what happens. Just carry on in your ow discreet way and nobody should bother you. And, if someone pours cold water o your ideas, it doesn't mean that you're wrong. 
LIBRA, Mercury is soon to shift its position again, meaning that your golden time for interviews, conferences and meetings is coming to an end. The deeper indication reveal that by the end of the week you will have to impress people with the breadth of your knowledge rather than the depth.

SCORPIO, People at work are bound to find you more congenial if you make a dramatic switch from criticising their weaknesses to praising their strengths. The funny thing is that one is as true as the other, it's just that, with the latter, you will get what you want! Diplomacy always works best. 
SAGITTARIUS, Home and family affairs should take priority now and over the coming two days. Fortunately, there are no indications of crisis or trauma, just pleasant sign that the more you get done now the happier you'll be. If you put off the inevitable then you'll only delay awkward questions. 
CAPRICORN, Partners are not always as reliable as you'd like. There does seem to be a very real indication that someone is about to change their minds or drop out of an arrangement. If you sense that something is wrong, you would do well to take the initiative and call a halt right now. READ | In Supreme Court, Rhea Chakraborty cites Bihar polls, says being made ‘political scapegoat' AQUARIUS Spare a little time for financial affairs, nothing important, mind you, just the inevitable paper-work and purchases. That might sound tedious, but don't worry because, on a personal note, your chart is still looking nicely volcanic! Expect fireworks soon in a good way. 
TAURUS, Professional concerns must be of paramount importance for all of you who are currently pursuing a vital working objective. Whatever your ambitions, you should see yourself as moving forward as part of a large family rather than as a solitary individual. You're not alone! 
GEMINI, Long-distance and travel interests require attention although, from today's picture, it doesn't seem that anything is going wrong. Perhaps it will do you good to check, though. Also, give a little more space to any mystical or religious beliefs and aspirations. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER Horoscope Today August 10, 2020: Capricorns, wrap up all agreements and arrangements over the coming days, although there's no real sense of urgency, even as far as money is concerned. Indeed, if someone has been pressing you to make a financial decision, you might be well advised to put the brakes on. Pause for thought. 
LEO, Partnerships hold the key to your happiness today, although it does seem very likely that you are feeling resentful or even bitter. You must choose whether to face up to people who have given you a hard time, or mix only with amiable and easy-going types. 
VIRGO, This certainly seems to be a time to keep busy but, quite aside from the inevitable work, you should put a little thought into your physical well-being. The Moon's recent relationship with Pluto suggests that this is a good moment to deal with long-standing complaints.

LIBRA, The overall planetary picture is still pressured, but it just so happens that what may be difficult for other people seems to be relatively easy for you. Perhaps you will gain from someone else's bad luck. If so, please see to it that they share in your good fortune. 
SCORPIO, Having put long-distance or long-term arrangements to one side, or satisfied yourself that all overseas contacts are up and running, you should then check out any outstanding legal questions and consider all the ethical issues. You need to occupy the moral high ground. 
SAGITTARIUS, Tie up any loose ends in the financial area over the next few days - today if possible. You must realise that if you ignore any outstanding business, you could be in danger of tipping a vast amount of money down one of those mysterious black holes that appear from time to time.

CAPRICORN, It's a pleasant day for distractions like shopping, or even just plain old-fashioned window-shopping. However, on the personal note, it is quite important to make sure that everyone is absolutely clear about your thoughts, opinions and intentions. AQUARIUS The tide of fortune flows your way today. My one concern is that you could be a little over-emotional, but then this might be no bad thing if you have been refusing to face up to certain awkward feelings. You will get nowhere by denying your desires. Instead, you need to understand them. 
TAURUS, It's all happening. Stunning relationships between planets like the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn will wake you up if nothing else does. I can promise you that very soon you'll be a new person. I'd also like to advise you that everything depends on how and when you say your piece. 
GEMINI, Venus is a good enough ally to have in times like these. By that I mean that you'll need every friend you have when the missiles start flying. Perhaps you can talk a bit of sense into people who seem determined to make the worst of a bad job. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates Cancer This is not the easiest of weeks to indicate what's what and who is who. However, at a guess, I'd say that you'll give as good as you get. Just remember that to be a good general you must have a strategy, and that to win every move you make must be absolutely faultless. 
LEO, Your financial stars are looking stronger by the day, which should come as some consolation. You see, employers, partners, relations and just about everyone you know will be unreliable, irascible and utterly contradictory. You'll need the patience of a saint, and that's just what you'll get! Read in Hindi: Horoscope Today, 09 August 2020 
VIRGO, It will be your job to supply the sticking plaster. Granted, you may feel mildly miffed or offended, but that doesn't change the fact that you must remain responsible. Money matters may be resolved after the next weekend, perhaps when somebody with more experience enters the frame. Follow weather live updates 
LIBRA, You have a great deal to be thankful for, not least of which is that Venus is in such a protective position. Overseas contacts and distant connections may be beneficial, and anything to do with higher education looks set to do well. Plus, your many efforts should be rewarded. 
SCORPIO, The Sun is but one of four planets which are shortly to send the world into a spin. At times like this it is always best to remember that yours is the sign of the healer. You may channel subtle cosmic energy into creative directions and counter the angry influences of your partners and colleagues. 
SAGITTARIUS, Oh, for the wisdom of a Sagittarian! Jupiter, your planetary ruler, is currently holding the world together, which means that you must come up with the answers wherever and whenever you see children or colleagues going in for a spot of mindless conflict. You may be the perfect peacemaker! Read | US, Pak, China watching, so didn't upload defence reports: outgoing CAG 
CAPRICORN, Would you believe it if I said you occupied a commanding position? Well, strange as it may seem, you are the instigator of the week's unusual happenings. You also hold most of the solutions, because only you have any idea of what is lined up for the next two years. AQUARIUS Sometimes we astrologers look ahead and say that the world will never be the same again. I can't say whether the changes in your life over the next two months will be bumpy or smooth. What I can promise is that when you look back on this period in your life, you will see how incredibly significant  it all was. 
TAURUS, It is said that although you were born a fighter, you have the heart of a peacemaker. In other words, although you naturally take command, you long for co-operation. Today is a good time to find it. It all looks very complicated though, so there really aren't any easy answers. 
GEMINI, Mercury's challenge to your sign should be teaching you the value of what great mystics call non-attachment. In this case it is your attitudes and opinions which should be abandoned, even if you've held them since time immemorial. A little more belief in the future would come in handy. Follow Kerala plane crash LIVE updates Cancer Seldom have you needed so much guidance and support. You probably won't let on, but inside it feels as if much of what you have striven for is unravelling. It isn't, of course, but your feelings still cry out for reassurance. You should get it in the next few days. 
LEO, There are increasingly strong signals that you're about to receive a series of welcome invitations. Rather than sitting next to the phone, waiting for it to ring, though, how about getting the ball rolling yourself? You never know, you might get the response you're hoping for.

LIBRA, One particularly encouraging aspect is setting you up for an emotional whirlwind. The main proviso is that you initiate new enterprises and adventures yourself, taking advantage of Jupiter's confidence-building influences. Also, keep a very close eye on cash opportunities. 
SCORPIO, You will probably be completely unaware of what is being planned at home or within your family. At the very least you can afford to be the recipient of welcome generosity. What makes more sense to you, though, is the old adage that it is nobler to give than to receive. 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll soon be able to strike out on your own, mainly because you have your own ideas. You'll no longer have to pay lip-service to employers, or anyone in authority for that matter. The fact is that you probably know more than they do, so  it's up to them to make the compromises. Read | As Lebanon fears food and medicine shortage, India plans to lend a hand

This makes for a complex situation in which debts of honour are as important as monetary ones. Plus, of course, there's the little question of a friend, who owes you a favour, to be considered. AQUARIUS You hold a full set of emotional trump cards at the moment. Whether you choose to play them today or save them until next week is another matter, but in general it's a case of the sooner the better. In fact, what's good for you might just be good for others, too. 
TAURUS, It's an excellent moment to get on with work that has been delayed for too long. If you face a mountain of chores, don't despair. Start at the beginning and you'll be surprised at just how little there really is to do. It's all a matter of arranging everything in a logical order.

Whether you choose to play them today or save them until next week is another matter, but in general it's a case of the sooner the better. In fact, what's good for you might just be good for others, too. 
TAURUS, You may well feel a little hurt or betrayed, but today's stars urge you to put the past behind you and get on with practical affairs. There is no point at all in raking over matters which are best left alone. Also, perhaps it's time to be kind and let someone else off the hook. 
GEMINI, A lively Moon is a pleasant presence in your chart. By reducing your general level of irritability, it could make you much more sympathetic to others, increasingly able to charm partners, and hence that much more successful. With friends on your side, a number of obstacles will soon disappear, as if by magic. CANCER In a strange and somewhat perverse way, you are probably enjoying this period. Mars' movement through intense regions of your chart brings out your latent conservatism, your feeling that many things are best left as they are. And maybe that's no bad thing. 
LEO, Take all due care and attention with financial matters, especially because if anyone is going to lose money or be over-charged, it's you! You should also take a practical attitude to social arrangements, and ignore the frankly impossible. 
VIRGO, Mercury, your planetary ruler, is beginning to make its lively presence felt, and a chance remark or encounter could give you the lever you need to force new items on to the agenda at home and at work. First, you have to stand back and give someone some extra space to sort themselves out. You know it makes sense! 
LIBRA, Sensitive planetary activity brings out your confidence. In particular, it makes you increasingly sure of your ideas, and it gives you the necessary poetic skill to express yourself to good effect. That alone has to make the future worth waiting for. 
SCORPIO, Personal dynamics are increasingly complex, as you are only too well aware. Other people have only been able to put you down in the past because you have allowed them. Now it is definitely the right time to pay more attention to your own needs and aspirations and lead a full life. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon is bound to get you thinking, and make you realise that physically, financially and emotionally, you need to redefine your centre of gravity. For now, all you should do is plan. Action can be left until later - even if sooner than you think! 
CAPRICORN, The Sun and Mars are now in a relationship which signifies a great deal of intensity on your part. You also seem to be suffering from an attack of doubt or a lack of confidence. The simple remedy is to get on with practical tasks until you succeed. AQUARIUS Your emotional situation is looking ever more buoyant, but everything revolves around the choices you allow yourself to take. At the heart of all your feelings is the question of commitment, and the need to decide whether to go, or to stay - or to dither! 
TAURUS, Venus, the planet which heralds emotional changes, is in many respects very well positioned indeed, so try to make things easier for yourself as well as others by being more flexible over long-term arrangements, especially at home. Try to understand a partner's point of view, even if you do disagree with it. 
GEMINI, Other people may be stealing your ideas. You may find this terribly irritating, but if you stop and think for a moment, you'll remember that imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery. You can actually change your attitudes completely - and offer a rival your help! READ | Ayodhya Ram Mandir Ground Breaking Ceremony Live Updates CANCER Anyone who believes that you are a placid and unambitious individual must be living on another planet, or just confused by the fact that, at the moment, many of your concerns are private and personal. Still, it's your right to be a mystery, if that's what you want. 
LEO, You may feel that you have been hoodwinked and manipulated, but you must remember that people who have reneged on promises or commitments may not have done so intentionally. They might have had little choice over the matter, and you can give them plenty of time to come round. 
VIRGO, It has been said that your perfectionism is at once your biggest strength and your greatest weakness. The problem for you now is that it will mean that while you succeed by other people's standards, you fail according to your own. Sometimes you're much too harsh on yourself!

LIBRA, Mars's magnificent role in your solar chart indicates that you are in perpetual danger of facing hostility from people who blame you for their own shortcomings. Such resentment may be brushed aside with the contempt it deserves, but you should also find time to smooth a loved one's ruffled feathers. 
SCORPIO, Serious problems only arise if you refuse to alter your stand on career or professional matters. If you accept whatever new responsibilities are pushed in your direction, you will gain in both confidence and experience. It will be a pleasant feeling when other people look up to you. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should be aware of just how fortunate you have been recently, for although Pluto, which signifies emotional upset, is a difficult planet, it is often much kinder to you than to anyone else. Now you can look forward to helpful developments at home. READ | Bandish Bandits review: Naseeruddin Shah towers over web series 
CAPRICORN, Although there is nothing you will receive with so much reluctance as advice, it should pay you to listen carefully. There may be many hidden meanings, and it could take someone with your sensitivity to pick them all up. If you do, then the results will definitely be to your advantage. AQUARIUS You may allow events to take their own course over the next few days, and wait for certain friends to make up their minds. This will happen very soon, but you can't say exactly when. All you can do is keep trying to make partners see sense. Perhaps you should also come off the fence. 
TAURUS, Taurus: There are times when you can be so very stubborn, but once you have let go you will be able to turn almost any situation to your advantage. At the present time it's all very much a matter of confidence. If you are to do your best, then you need to know that you actually can succeed! 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mercury, the symbol of bright ideas, has a reputation for stirring up mischievous behaviour. This is bound to be enhanced under its current imaginative relationship with Neptune and Pluto, so you may break the rules - all within reason of course! CANCER Cancer: All your instincts must be telling you to stay and put up a fight. However, the danger is that you'll be fighting old battles and, even if you win, it is unlikely to do you much good. And then there's the little matter of whether other people will back down - which they probably won't! 
LEO, Leo: What is revealed now may make you realise that people at home were keeping you in the dark long before you ever suspected it. Hopefully, your sense of humour is sufficient for you to take practical jokes in good part. If it's not, then please lighten up now - while you still have time. 
VIRGO, Virgo: On a day when the Moon is roughly on your side, the opportunities for self-improvement are limitless. You may even return to activities from which you were once inexplicably barred. Hopefully, you yourself are also no longer making the same old excuses. 
LIBRA, Libra: You should never try to blame others for your embarrassment, or for any irritation you feel over a current dilemma. There is no need to hold others responsible, for you can rectify the situation without their support. It will be tougher by yourself, but you might have a greater sense of satisfaction at the end. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You should now be beginning to feel very much more optimistic about your family situation, and confident that before the week is out the expected light will be well and truly at the end of what has been a very long tunnel. In other words, you can live in hope! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You may turn your gaze to professional affairs and see to it that all details are safely covered, if not by you then at least by others who are competent and responsible. There is no point in hanging back, not when there is so much to gain by moving forward. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Your urge to make a stable nest and build a firm emotional base is powerful, but must now be paid for. Your financial hopes will have to be justified by your available resources, otherwise you'll have to think again. But when it comes to finding the answers, perhaps two heads will be wiser than one. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You may be spoilt for choice. The only drawback is the possibility that you're so used to being told that such-and-such a thing is not for you, that you'll completely fail to notice when a golden opportunity passes by. Keep your eyes open! 
TAURUS, Taurus: Your first reaction to a new proposition will probably be to accept it without question, especially if it relates to home or family matters. Only later will doubts begin to creep in. Knowing this, you may wish to take more time in the first place! 
GEMINI, Gemini: Today's dominant planetary alignment is nicely helpful, and will enable you to bring out your legendary qualities - such as your ability to talk at great length about almost anything! But will anyone else understand you? Well, perhaps it really doesn't matter! CANCER Cancer: The first thing to be considered now is your role in an emotional relationship or joint undertaking. The heart of the matter could be financial, including the question of who pays for what. That might be an issue you can't solve now - so put it off till tomorrow! 
LEO, Leo: A relative or colleague may now believe that you can be brow-beaten or otherwise forced to accept second-best. If only they knew that the Moon was on your side, they'd see how wrong they are! The stars' first advice is to stand your ground, and only to compromise when you know the result is going to be fair. 
VIRGO, Virgo: It's because you put on a brave face and conceal your true feelings that others often misunderstand your real intentions. Now, before you can talk about your emotions you need properly to understand your motives. If you then say what you mean, other people might actually sit up and pay attention. 
LIBRA, Libra: Loved ones may be argumentative, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong which can't be smoothed over with a little kindness and compassion. Friends can be called in to help if extra assistance is required. See to it that you contact the right people at the appropriate time, though. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You may be wondering how long it will be before underlying tensions can finally be satisfactorily resolved. The answer is not for some time yet, so continue to take whatever evasive action you feel is necessary. Your next step might actually be to look at the financial implications. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Mercury, ruler of deep thought and wisdom, is now approaching a supportive relationship with Jupiter, planet of inspiration. The psychological impact finds your intellectual processes becoming sharper, to the point where your judgment will be beyond criticism. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: No one can prevent you continuing a feud for as long as Mars arouses your irritation - or even anger. But you can decide for yourself whether it is really worthwhile letting the distant past colour your present actions - or allowing chance events to disturb your emotional equilibrium. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Workwise you have been through a period of change, and it's now time to make the necessary personal adjustments. If you have in any way neglected your social life or ignored old friends, now is the moment to correct the balance. Get in touch! 
TAURUS, Taurus: The Sun and Mercury are certainly in a sociable mood, so this is no time to cut yourself off from other people, or turn down attractive invitations. You would be wise to push yourself forward at work and take the initiative. Moneywise, your stars are in the mood for a risk. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mars is still pushing you forward, urging you to express yourself, and seize the high ground. You'll receive a great deal of credit at work if you burn the candle at both ends. Mind you, is other people's respect really worth the extra effort? That's a calculation you'll have to make. CANCER Cancer: You're such a sensitive soul, but this is no time to whinge or whine. Stellar alignments based around gentle and friendly areas of your chart suggest that you can get away with anything. Well, almost anything! By the way, you'll do well to get financial deals settled by the middle of the week. Follow coronavirus in India Live updates 
LEO, Leo: Jupiter and Saturn are now but a hair's breadth away, celestially speaking, from one of their periodic stunning alignments. You may capitalise on your good fortune to broaden your social circle and rake in the profits. At work you'll probably be concerned with routine detail rather than grand plans. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Once again the accent is very much on personal affairs, but this time you may play every single trump card in your hand. The present emotional game should last about two weeks, so pace yourself and don't be hurried. Your financial stars are strongest at the beginning of the week. 
LIBRA, Libra: It's often difficult to let go of the past, and you might have your share of regrets. But maybe you should realise that you have been freed from a burden you are happier without. Venus is setting you up for some splendid social gatherings or romantic encounters. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You seem to spend a great deal of your life keeping other people happy. Complex planetary indications suggest that family members are bound to come up with some new complaint or argument. You are a big enough person to be able to forgive and forget. Covid-19 virus tracker, August 2: Clinical trials of Russian vaccine over 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Although the general mood is optimistic, certain adverse planetary indications signify that you must keep your wits about you. That's partly because you seem to be growing busier by the hour. Plus, it's possible that a valuable item could be lost, or an arrangement misunderstood, so keep everything above board. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Sometimes the universe seems to typecast you. It is said that it is better for you to save than spend, advice which you have often, but not always, followed. It probably doesn't matter what you do now, just as long as you talk everything over with everyone who is involved. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You may put all your prejudices to one side and make sure that other people respect you for acting out of the very highest of motives. Remember that old saying that it is nobler by far to give than receive. Also, you may be called upon to exercise authority over wayward youngsters, never an easy task.

TAURUS, You could be at your most persuasive. This really is a sociable day and you should make great play of your ability to bring people together. Prospects for those in the property market are distinctly better than average but, as usual, your planning has to be perfect. 
GEMINI, The various relationships between Mars, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter are perfectly optimistic in their inclinations, and should suit you down to the ground. This is a time to get on with your favourite tasks, to exchange information, make short trips and generally chase your special ambitions.

You'll need all the courage and confidence at your disposal. 
LEO, Slowly but surely you ought to be reassuring partners of your loyalty and dedication. The lesson to learn at the moment is that partnerships must be worked at. This simple truth is quite compatible with the fun, pleasure and enjoyment that come from special associations. 
VIRGO, Other people hold the key. It doesn't matter whether your speciality is a working partnership, a romantic liaison or just friendship in general. All that is important is that you open your heart. Once you do that, then other people may respond in the ways that you always hoped they would.

LIBRA, What you can do now is take a much firmer line with children. You should also realise that there are many chores to be completed and tasks to be done, even if you are in the mood for a day off. Your best approach is to call in a long-forgotten favour. 
SCORPIO, As the Moon moves to and fro between challenging regions of your chart and harmonious ones, the chances for romantic happiness improve. You should seize the opportunity to enjoy yourself, regardless of whether your interests are high-brow or low. 
SAGITTARIUS, Once again, home and family affairs occupy your attention. It may be a day to indulge in your favourite practical tasks, or to enjoy the company of your favourite relations. Friendly communication with everyone is the top theme for the next twenty-four hours. READ | Lootcase review: A bland comedy-drama 
CAPRICORN, There is a great temptation to talk about subjects of which you know nothing. If you can get away with a bluff, do so by all means. On the other hand, if facts are important, you may care to get a second opinion. That's especially the case if you're risking your own cash. AQUARIUS The time has come to clear the decks, as I think you know. As long as you have major personal matters in hand, you may indulge a financial whim. If spending plans are your top priority, then it looks as if frivolities may be a better buy than necessities. READ | I believe I will get justice: Rhea Chakraborty 
TAURUS, If a promised move of home or major domestic change is held up over the next six months, the reason is that you should stay where you are and address fundamental questions. It may be that you need to work at a current relationship. Or it possibly that solid repairs and substantial building work are necessary. Which is it to be? 
GEMINI, I don't think that anyone should tangle with you at the moment. If they do, they must reckon on the fact that you're in a martial mood, and that you will therefore undoubtedly give as good as you get. You are not about to give way gracefully if there's no reason to do so. Follow Coronavirus LIVE UPDATES here CANCER Money matters should now be settled, at least as far as the short-term is concerned. You may now like to consider other questions, like where on earth you're going to go on holiday this year, if anywhere. You see, the important connections seem to lie a long way away. 
LEO, You can make great strides forward at this time. Hopefully, personal matters may be put to one side. In that case, you could direct your thoughts towards the financial situation. There are indeed purchases to be made, but savings seem  more perfectly to suit your mood. 
VIRGO, Your role and purpose must be to renew bonds with individuals who have drifted apart. The chance of a dispute at work can be postponed with some fancy footwork and a few words of reassurance. The fact that a partner may be feeling uncomfortable with current arrangements is enough to encourage you to look at how they can be improved.

LIBRA, Did you know that you have a reputation amongst astrologers for being lazy? Actually, I think you are misunderstood. The fact is that at times like these you quite properly resent tasks which are beneath your dignity. You don't like to waste your talents. It's as simple as that. 
SCORPIO, Your partnerships are not always straightforward. This you know well enough. Your long-term task now is to simplify all family relationships, get down to essentials and strip away the waffle. You might have to wait while a partner gets their act together, though. 
SAGITTARIUS, Given that you may have to delay decisive moves at home, you may still do your bit to improve your lot. Your strongest emotional contacts are with family members or people you live with and, if you recognise this simple fact, then a number of problems will disappear. 
CAPRICORN, Do get on with plans, proposals and intuitive ideas. If you talk to people today you should find them sympathetic listeners, and this knowledge may encourage you to confide feelings you'd normally keep to yourself. But don't tell them anything that might cause embarrassment. AQUARIUS The heavy hand of Saturn is now a semi-permanent influence on your life, but I must say that it is a very favourable one. It could bring eventual security, even though today you may have doubts over your financial future. You'll get your way through cautious and consistent planning. 
TAURUS, The period you are now entering will put amazing pressure on you to move home. I'm talking, by the way, in terms of a time-scale of at least six months, but the point is that any premature decision will either not come to pass or be severely delayed. 
GEMINI, Long-buried feelings and desires should come to the surface, and quite right, too. This is a positive phase, favouring all long-term adventures and far-flung possibilities. Integrity is a must. The moment your standards slip, then your plans will begin to come unstuck. CANCER You must be at some pains to point out that obstacles are not your responsibility. However, if you can possibly also spread the word that you are not solely to thank for a number of favourable moves, and that other people should share the credit, then your humility will eventually be rewarded. 
LEO, Please don't imagine that you have been passed by. There is enough in today's stars to indicate that should you accept first that cooperation is vital, and second, that other people's feelings should be taken into account. In other words, selflessness wins the day! 
VIRGO, There's still no let-up at work. In fact, there is every indication that life is about to get even busier. Please don't grumble, for consciously or unconsciously, you are inviting fresh responsibilities and letting yourself in for extra hard work. 
LIBRA, Your romantic and social prospects are not perfect, but you're ninety-five percent there. Do give all personal contacts, from the most intimate liaisons right down to casual meetings, your fullest attention. The last thing you want to do now is make a slip that will upset someone who matters to you. 
SCORPIO, Everything that I have said about the potential for change at home continues, yet in a far more intense fashion. If I were you, I'd wait until the dust settles before acting on current feelings. Perhaps, though, you can press on with small and unimportant plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you're holding discussions, conducting a debate or attending an interview, well done: you are absolutely and totally in tune with your stars. In any case, please do make a point of sharing all your desires, hopes and plans with everyone who is concerned, however remotely. 
CAPRICORN, The financial indications are contradictory, but I'd say you're in with a better than average chance of a windfall. The important point is not to get bound up with the details of income and expenditure, but to resolve to deal with money better. A positive attitude now equals prosperity in the future. AQUARIUS Get into top gear and take control. At work, at home, in love and in business, this is the day to make a fresh start. Psychological and material spring-cleaning should be comprehensive, thorough and all-embracing. Leave no stone unturned. 
TAURUS, I am sure that a loved one has been all too ready to pursue a cavalier approach. It has been easy to dodge personal issues by immersing yourself in work or some other worldly ambition, but perhaps you do now need to face up to intimate, deeply emotional questions. 
GEMINI, Push yourself to the limit. The best estimation of your prospects indicates that you must make up for lost time in addition to coping with fresh responsibilities. Don't fall back on old excuses to avoid facing your destiny. Have courage, Gemini!

I am not telling you to turn your back on opportunity, but I do think that you should be more selective in future. Concentrate your energy on areas which are bound to bring success, and avoid time-wasting offers. 
LEO, You are almost certainly unaware of deeper planetary movements which are even now affecting the most hidden recesses of your psyche. But do be assured that for the rest of the year, authority, tradition and stability are the keywords in your personal life. Explained: Why Ashok Gehlot — or Sachin Pilot or BJP — is not asking for a floor test in Rajasthan 
VIRGO, There's no rest for the wicked, as the old saying goes. There's no rest for you either, so you may as well recognise that relaxation will be in short supply. Keep your nose to the grindstone and get as much done as you can. The more you do now, the more time you'll have off later on. 
LIBRA, All you have to do is be yourself. Easy advice, I know. I also realise that this may be the hardest thing in the world to achieve, but there's no harm in trying, is there? The general planetary picture is very optimistic, so set off with a song in your heart. 
SCORPIO, There's been a great deal of talk lately about the need to save face. This is a concept which means a great deal to you, and people you live with had better recognise this. The best way to placate you is to make you feel that you've won - even if you haven't! 
SAGITTARIUS, Reassuring relationships connect Mars, Jupiter and other helpful planets. In plain language this means that personal relationships dovetail with overseas links. A perfect time for a long-distance trip perhaps? You should certainly pay special attention to all foreign connections. Also Read | On Delhi portal, job-seekers call in from Bengal to Kerala 
CAPRICORN, The benevolent planet Jupiter balances the aggressive planet Mars. The result? Well, for a start, I'd say you're being set up for an increase in your earnings. Luck doesn't come into it. Instead it's all thanks to your own hard work. Give yourself a pat on the back. AQUARIUS It will be a rare individual who doesn't recognise that every difficulty conceals a host of benefits. There is so much going for you at the moment that you may finally have your cake - and eat it! Other people may be envious of what they see, rightly or wrongly, as your good fortune. 
TAURUS, The truth of your situation should now be becoming clear. You may, for example, be about to realise the importance of authority and tradition. At work, there is no way to evade the powers that be. Your most positive approach is to do what you have to for now, and try to turn the tables when the time is right. 
GEMINI, You may be about to amaze loved ones with a display of energy. I'm not advising you to be aggressive, but I would like to see you being more self-assertive in the very best sense. Stand up for what you know to be right. If you take the easy way out, then you won't respect yourself - and neither will other people. CANCER There will of course be times when you don't see eye to eye with loved ones, but you may head off potential confrontations by biting your tongue, turning the other cheek and allowing  people to learn from their own mistakes. That might be the best approach for them as well as for you. Read in Hindi: Horoscope Today, 28 July 2020 
LEO, There is no point in advising you to ignore what is happening at home. You may get away with burying your head in the sand now but, if you do, your problems will escalate over the summer. Therefore, you must deal with all those fundamental issues, now. 
VIRGO, The general planetary set-up indicates that you are still unclear whether to press ahead with your own individual goals or muck in and help out with tasks that are primarily others' concern. The answer is to do what you want today, but do what you have to tomorrow! 
LIBRA, You should be ready to stand up and be counted. You must also be ready to put your back into achieving special personal goals. Don't ever expect to attain your goals without putting in sufficient effort. The cosmos just doesn't operate like that. 
SCORPIO, Astrology is infinitely complicated, and today's stars are completely overshadowed by alignments that take place in two to four days' time, so don't be mesmerised by short-term developments. Do yourself a favour by talking about your plans and discussing your hopes. 
SAGITTARIUS, The moment may have come to spring a few surprises, but there's a supreme irony here. The way you can astound people is by being utterly conservative. Radical ideas are out of date, and traditional values are in - at least for today! Tomorrow may be different! 
CAPRICORN, Personally and emotionally this has been a trying time. Today's fascinating stars vary from being totally superficial to utterly profound. There is no middle way, so don't be complacent. You will have to decide which path you're taking and then follow it through. AQUARIUS Don't concern yourself with what happens today. It's the evening that counts, and if I were arranging your movements, I'd advise you to stay in bed until later. It may be impossible to fit in with such an awkward planetary schedule, but do your best! 
TAURUS, It's fair to say that your planetary patterns are favourable, all the more so if your inclination is generally inspired, visionary even. The closer you come to practical responsibilities, the greater the need for additional care and caution 
GEMINI, Partners can't read your mind, so tell them what you think. If your aims are professional, and if you're planning a spot of personal promotion you could do worse than set your sights on the next few days. You may just receive a windfall, even if only on a modest scale. Omar Abdullah writes| While J&amp;K remains UT, will not contest Assembly polls CANCER The Moon is normally such a sympathetic planet, but today it leaves you in no doubt that it is other people who require your loving care and sympathy. Reach out and offer the hand of support to those in need. They will pay you back in their own way - when they can. 
LEO, There's no escape from busy planetary pictures and hence no way to avoid your responsibilities. The best course may be to get as much achieved as you possibly can, in order to give yourself more scope for relaxation tomorrow and the day after. Have a break. Put your feet up! 
VIRGO, You may see creative self-expression as a voluntary activity, but the planets don't agree. Today, in so many little ways, you may be compelled to be an individual and be true to your own utterly unique talents. Employers please note! And family members please take care!

LIBRA, There seems little doubt that home and family affairs will dominate your thoughts and feelings today. Even if you are determined to give the highest priority to work, it will be deep and fundamental issues which demand your attention, including your domestic relationships. 
SCORPIO, Some celestial indications suggest that you may be called away from home, possibly on account of work or a similar responsibility. In any event, the main goal is to communicate clearly and make yourself properly understood. Someone else may owe you an apology, but don't hold your breath! 
SAGITTARIUS, Business affairs will occupy your attention. Your financial stars are looking considerably less complex than this time last year, and today you may cut across a whole series of irrelevant hangovers like the proverbial hot knife through butter. Read| How Covid has hit learning; what's the way forward? 
CAPRICORN, The ball is in your court. Tackle private affairs and deal with professional activities only if you feel a deep personal motivation. Romantic encounters and sentimental journeys are desirable, if only because the results may be much more delightful than expected. AQUARIUS Any feelings of uncertainty or confusion should be short-lived, and by late tomorrow you could be back in the driving seat. In the meantime, remember that you're now into a fantastically productive long-term cycle. The world will judge you by your deeds rather than your words. 
TAURUS, You are talented than you imagine. Astound competitors and colleagues, not to mention friends and allies, with your business flair. The entire financial situation is somewhat complex at the moment, but if you bring your impeccable sense of taste to the fore you could pull off a major coup. There could be bargains galore. 
GEMINI, Your stars are looking more powerful than for many weeks. Mars, the planet of energy and aggression, is encouraging you to feel a great deal more intense than usual. This is precisely why you must now review all personal obligations and professional ties. You may have made a promise which you will find it impossible to keep. Read | Ayodhya 2.0.2.0: 'Bigger temple, 3 domes, double the sandstone' Cancer The Sun's relationship with Jupiter has one very specific meaning - large pay rises for all whose income has suffered or has not reflected their best efforts. In any event, emotional riches are in the offing, so one way or another you're bound to benefit. Your heart is more important than your bank-balance, so keep a proper balance in your affairs. 
LEO, Somewhat challenging planetary patterns still relate both to your family scene and events which may have taken place a very long time ago indeed. Yet, if by any chance you have moved beyond certain people, don't let them drag you back. Quite aside from which, your romantic stars are shining brightly. 
VIRGO, Pleasurable planets are sure to play their part. Home entertaining and joyful family gatherings are strongly signified by midweek stars. There is a suspicion that something may be arranged without your knowledge. You'll be doing your bit to help the needy, much to your credit. Read | In the time of a pandemic, when will we dress up and go out? 
LIBRA, It's a good moment to turn your back on the past and focus on the future. If you want to get all your domestic chores over in double-quick time, try a spot of lateral thinking, take a risk and turn everything on its head. If you're travelling, short journeys seem to fare better than long. 
SCORPIO, It's time to turn your gaze outwards. If personal affairs are just too much, how about having another crack at some public ambition or worldly enterprise that you have ignored or forgotten? If shopping sprees are lined up, you'll probably find that luxuries are a much better bet than necessities. 
SAGITTARIUS, Remarkable opportunities to enhance your reputation are highlighted by a superb series of relationships involving planets such as the Sun, Saturn and Jupiter. Foreign and long-distance connections could come up trumps, although you should be very careful to avoid legal complications , unless you've got the benefit of impeccable advice.

CAPRICORN, It's all change in the celestial spheres. Mercury, that most lively of planets, is now setting the agenda, hopefully with the very best of results. Within the week you are liable to receive a flash of inspiration that could help you completely remodel and rearrange your affairs. First, though, take a long look at the past. AQUARIUS You may still be caught in the crossfire. Jupiter and Pluto are definitely at odds and you are teetering on the edge of far-reaching changes both on the home front and at work. Midweek may bring the liveliest family influences, with much pleasure to be found in the company of children. 
TAURUS, The Sun and the Moon have both recently come to your aid, and you should be set up for a very positive future. Today's stars put the accent on domestic affairs, so family relationships should come first, and people you live with will be hogging the limelight. 
GEMINI, Short journeys beckon, so you may accept any invitations that take you away from home. Mind you, they're as likely to be for business as for pleasure. If you are waiting for someone to get in touch, wait no longer. Take the initiative, make the first move and never doubt yourself. READ | Use pandemic lessons well: Centre gives 6-point mantra to surge states CANCER You may feel the need to be a little more secretive than usual, yet without being deceptive or manipulative. Your romantic stars are at a height, and even the slightest change will find you feeling much more sensitive than usual. Still, it's good to be in touch with your emotions. 
LEO, This is certain to be a time of emotional ups and downs, with an emphasis on the ups. However, only determined action will shift a log-jam to do with work, or resolve deep-rooted irritations at home. First of all, though, you need to work out what partners really want. 
VIRGO, Dream on. Your imagination should be at its peak, which means that there could be extra worries, but that you should also emphasise all the positive angles in your life at the moment. Concentrate on the ethical issues, and raise moral standards all round. READ | Dil Bechara review: Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer is equal parts dirge and catharsis 
LIBRA, Some sort of financial crisis is looming, so fancy footwork will be necessary if you want to avoid bad feeling and save yourself some of your hard-earned cash. If you're in the housing market, or otherwise contemplating large domestic purchases, follow a hunch. 
SCORPIO, Watch out for emotional squalls, and be aware of the extent to which you may be responsible for any ructions. This doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong, but there may be things which you have left undone, which in their turn have left someone else high and dry. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your imagination may lead you a merry old dance, and feelings like resentment, jealousy, anger and the desire for revenge are lurking. However, first you should make a fair and reasonable assessment of the situation. Let the facts speak for themselves.

CAPRICORN, Seldom have your stars looked more passionate - at least not for a month or so! Such feelings will of course have intense repercussions for your romantic affairs, but will also influence other areas of your life. Adopt a bold and colourful approach. AQUARIUS You are much stronger than you think, and even apparently disastrous developments will turn out in your favour. You must pay special attention to partners who are swept by feelings they can't understand - and don't tangle with authority, either!

TAURUS, Keep your wits about you at all times, mainly because what is now taking place away from your gaze will affect your future interests. It may be next week before you discover what partners are doing. The simple solution is to see to it that your own plans are watertight. 
GEMINI, At work and at home you must keep the talking going, aware of the need for agreement. At the very least you must make sure that loved ones know your views on a promised gathering or engagement. If you explain yourself, then they can't pretend they didn't understand you! CANCER It's time to get out and indulge in a spot of shopping therapy, hopefully today, but tomorrow will do if you really are tied up just now. There's nothing like spending a bit of money on an overdue treat to lift your morale. But, then, you still need a long-term solution, so don't imagine that you're off the hook! Read in Hindi: Horoscope Today, 24 July 2020 
LEO, You are bathed in beneficial lunar alignments, and these are bound to make you feel increasingly emotional - and more compassionate. You may also be a little gullible, and hence a soft touch for some! So, keep a weather eye open for roving confidence tricksters. 
VIRGO, You do tend to worry, and sometimes you wonder if you've backed the wrong horse. However, right now you should allow yourself a great deal more space to consider the options and give current developments time to work themselves out before making rash decisions. 
LIBRA, Your social stars are beginning to look more buoyant, and you should keep your eye open for new friends and fascinating meetings. Where romance is concerned, it looks very much as if security is increasingly the main issue. You want to hang on to what you've got. 
SCORPIO, Strident planetary aspects force you to choose between home and work, between family interests and outside ambitions. Once you have made your position clear, others should give you the freedom to go your own way. But is that really what you want? You won't know unless you've got it! 
SAGITTARIUS, Let the past take care of itself and concentrate on the untried and untested solutions of the future. It will do you a power of good to improve conditions at work, spreading a bit of colour around and generally raising the quality of life. And while you're at it, why don't you reassure people you live with that you're right behind them? 
CAPRICORN, Perhaps long-term financial commitments and obligations are causing concern, but you will have to understand that partners may not share your outlook. Relax and trust a little more in the healing power of time. It's strange how what is so important today can be completely forgotten tomorrow. AQUARIUS It's a fairly stressful day, but by no means a bad one. Much depends on how far you are prepared to welcome change, and to what extent you can turn friction to your advantage. It may be a cliche, but do look on the bright side, won't you? After all, optimism breeds success. 
TAURUS, You should not expect to get your way over a professional matter. If you do succeed, all well and good, but otherwise you should be patient and accept that for any ambition to be fulfilled, the time must be right. There's little to be gained from fighting battles you can't win - and a great deal to be lost. 
GEMINI, You may be inclined to distance yourself from certain events in your past, and in the future you might concentrate more on schemes designed to broaden your horizons. The crucial factor, though, is how much you can really afford. The first step, then, is to count your cash. CANCER There will definitely be a few emotional ups and downs today, and even the occasional misunderstanding, most likely around midday. Stay on your toes and keep an eye on the beneficial long-term pattern. And don't get too upset by people who pick up the wrong end of the stick.

LEO, There could be a mystery to solve, perhaps a lost possession or mislaid instructions. There could even be an element of farce if other people fail to keep appointments or just generally miss the point! The best advice? Probably to hang on to your sense of humour. 
VIRGO, Once in a while you are given a moment to pause, to come up for air and take your bearings. This must be one such time, and if you can possibly work out exactly who is doing what, you'll get a very much better notion of your own future role- and a good thing, too! 
LIBRA, Events which take place now could make you less inclined to count the cost of a relationship which may have lost its glitter. In other words, be thankful for what you have, and don't expect people to be things they're not! Sometimes happiness flows from appreciating what you've got. 
SCORPIO, There are no simple solutions. However, you can ensure that others take you at your word, and give you the necessary backing. The emotional situation at the moment could be rather fraught if you fail to notice that partners require ten times the normal dose of affection.

SAGITTARIUS, You have learnt many harsh lessons in the past, but now you must take on the hardest of all - to trust other people. Fortunately, the emotional issues seem to be slight, so only practical problems need to be faced. Partners will appreciate a businesslike approach. 
CAPRICORN, Your chart is like a maze, and it's all a question of finding your way to the heart of the matter. For reasons best known to yourself you appear to be caught between two emotional choices. These seem to relate to family members rather than friends or lovers, and the solutions are right under your nose! AQUARIUS An opportunity which materialises some time over the next few weeks could enable you to make a completely fresh start. The absolutely vital point now is to talk about all your plans, even at the risk of being thought silly. If partners don't understand you, that's their problem!

TAURUS, It's a useful day to travel, make contacts and extend discussions which may have got off to a faltering start. Good communication is of the essence, and anyone attending interviews or other important meetings has a perfect right to be confident. 
GEMINI, For the next month or so you may be tremendously open and upfront, but, in reality, keeping all your most important and intense feelings deeply hidden! However, consider this: if you want to communicate with loved ones you might have to be a little more direct. CANCER It's time to take control and insist that other people see things your way. This doesn't mean that you should ignore their interests, but it's about time you had a fair and unbiased hearing. Perhaps you should spend a little longer preparing your case. 
LEO, Daydream to your heart's content, and don't let other people make you feel strange for wanting to spend time by yourself. At work, it's very much who you know rather than what you know that carries you through. There's nothing wrong in exploiting personal contacts - is there? 
VIRGO, Your social stars become stronger, which means that even at work it is personal connections which count most. However, you may put the details to one side and look at the long-term, making every effort to broaden your horizons. Besides, there's a surprise just around the corner. 
LIBRA, It's time to be more forthright about your ambitions, including professional aspirations. Also, bear in mind that you can no longer shrug off partners' irritation, for there appear to be deeper issues at stake than you once thought. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you. 
SCORPIO, You may check out the legal situation, putting the  emphasis on your own rights, but not forgetting your responsibilities. Don't let other people make the running when it comes to setting standards, for their view of what should and shouldn't be done is less rigorous than yours. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is an adventurous moment, and you should know now that you can't be held back by social taboos which have lost their meaning. Your competitive instincts must be released if you are to come out on top. However, it's not so much a matter of finishing first as doing the best job. 
CAPRICORN, Partnership affairs are central to your life today, so you really should attempt to reach a compromise. Partners and colleagues may be muddled, or they may be unable to express themselves clearly, but that doesn't diminish the relevance of their message. AQUARIUS There's so much planetary activity in the lower reaches of your chart that maximum change must be expected at home. It could be about another twelve weeks before you're clear about what your part must be. People could be coming and going, but what you really need is security. 
TAURUS, From now on you will have to move very carefully, flitting about behind the scenes, doing your best without being spotted! The coming phase in your life is one for discretion, so plan accordingly. Also, if a friend or partner lets you down, don't be too hard on them: they might have no choice. 
GEMINI, This should be a somewhat sensitive day. But, on the other hand, your confidence should be growing. The golden rule is never to take offence, and always realise that little slights may be unintended. Partners really are in need of your care and understanding, so you'll have to be patient. CANCER You are undoubtedly well aware of certain emotional undercurrents, and it's thanks to your intuitive skills that you're more in tune than many other people with the choices that should now be faced. That doesn't mean that you'll come up with the right answers, though, so tread carefully. 
LEO, Don't expect any let-up in the pressure in the long-term, even if today's stars are more relaxed than usual. You should realise that any friction can be turned to good use, giving you the excuse to make long-overdue improvements, especially at work. 
VIRGO, This is one occasion when partners may be better equipped to take control. At work employers should be listened to and obeyed, although they in their turn should recognise your role as a conciliator. It's all a matter of mutual respect - and of striking the right balance. 
LIBRA, The best relationships at the moment are those based on joint interests, and the happiest social life is that built on good conversation. Consider the legal situation, and make sure that, above all else, you know your rights. And don't give anyone the wrong idea about your intentions. 
SCORPIO, The cycle you're now entering is one which warns you about the danger of burning yourself out, but offers you the chance to get your physical well-being together, cleaning up your diet, improving your exercise and tackling niggling chronic complaints. 
SAGITTARIUS, Partners and business associates will eventually reveal facts which you think they ought to know. However, when it comes to dealing with people in authority, extracting the truth may be like getting blood out of a stone. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't continue to try! 
CAPRICORN, Areas of your life which are now being spotlighted indicate exactly where you should streamline your affairs and how you should reorganise your relationships. Consider any and all changes at home, no matter how radical. You never know - they might receive a warm welcome. AQUARIUS Circumstances beyond your control may now force you to abandon certain schemes, or at least reach a major compromise. Family plans are still in a state of some uncertainty, while domestic entertaining looks favourable. Take advantage of any opportunities for pleasure! 
TAURUS, It's time for a fresh start. Emotional and psychological spring-cleaning should encourage you to put the past behind you and face the future with an open heart. You seem to be keeping a secret - and you may hang on to it for just a little while longer. 
GEMINI, You may now have to come into the open, so have your story ready and make sure you're capable of making yourself understood. Throughout the day you should find that your self-esteem is restored, and that it's no longer necessary to take refuge in your day-dreams. CANCER It's quite a good time to keep yourself to yourself, to find the time and space to listen to your imagination. You may even consider cancelling a social engagement. But before you take any precipitate action, realise that when the time comes, your feelings might have moved on. 
LEO, You may feel as if you are being forced to do something against your will or against your dignity. However, the best advice now is to press ahead and concentrate on making colleagues see your point of view. Gentle persuasion might work better then brute force. In fact, I'm sure it will! 
VIRGO, You will soon be afforded a splendid chance to travel to somewhere you've never been before. In any event, you'll do yourself a very big favour if you extend and develop all contacts with companions in distant parts and people from different cultures. 
LIBRA, Problems of a partnership or matrimonial nature should soon be faced. You may find that once you talk about your concerns, they begin to disappear and your innate sense of well-being returns. An old expense is about to return, but it's also time to collect a debt. 
SCORPIO, Much as you'd like to be the centre of attention, you still have no choice but to listen to other people, understand their feelings and try to satisfy their desires. Financial choices are now  appearing, but there is no need for a final decision just yet. 
SAGITTARIUS, When dealing with finances, business or property matters you should make a point of being as clear-headed as you can. Your heart tells you one thing, your wallet another, so seek expert advice. This is not a good time to give people the wrong idea about your intentions, so make sure you're not misunderstood. 
CAPRICORN, This looks like a busy day, and it's time to call on your more versatile talents. In view of emotional complications, it seems likely that you'll have to juggle different balls in the air at the same time. It may not be easy, especially if a friend or colleague backs out of a commitment. AQUARIUS Favourable planetary alignments are  perfectly balanced by challenging ones, which means that you could have the best of both worlds. This should also be an ideal moment to put your plans into practice. Thought and action should go hand in hand, and your heart and your head should be leading you in the same direction. 
TAURUS, Putting others first is a reasonable Taurean trait. However, the balance should now be restored and I advise you to be a little selfish for a change. If you feel uncomfortable with this, then just think about how much more helpful you can be to friends and family if you're happy and fulfilled. 
GEMINI, It's all change as Mercury, your witty planetary ruler, undertakes its nifty journey through regions of your solar chart relating to some of your most intense ambitions. There is every chance to get to meet new people and come to terms with a partnership which may have hit a rocky patch. It's time to consider new and exciting ideas. Follow coronavirus in India LIVE updates Cancer You have no single plan of action this week. Instead you can opt for variety. Some of your planets are usually so serious, but lately they have been urging you to let your hair down and party. I hope that you have taken advantage of such celestial possibilities because you're now returning to routine activities and work. 
LEO, By all the laws of astrology most Leos have recently moved home. What's more probable is that you have recently experienced a number of major improvements in your domestic conditions. But the real way to interpret Such alignments is that they point to your increasing desire to understand what you're doing on this planet. 
VIRGO, The Moon is playing up this week, indicating that other people don't always see eye-to-eye. Domestic and family spending will be well up the agenda and impulse buys should be kept to a minimum. This is very much a time to broaden your horizons and focus on the most productive ways to use your funds. 
LIBRA, You are not alone in finding that money is the strongest feature of your horoscope for the week. You may do best to hunt around for bargains, but you'll probably miss out unless you team up with friends. Romantic news arrives soon, and you may have cause to celebrate, perhaps on a friend's behalf. READ | Ram temple Trust fixes Aug 3 or 5 for start of work, requests PM to join in 
SCORPIO, Some planetary patterns are good news for you, if not for the rest of us, so be kind to people who get left behind. This really is the moment at which your individual astrological year gets going. It's time for a spot of emotional spring-cleaning - and a few firm resolutions to carry you into the future. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your noble and generous personality is beginning to win new friends. You should be comforted to know that others genuinely appreciate your willingness to keep certain information to yourself. They have also finally noticed your selfless activities and readiness to offer helpful advice. The latter part of the week should favour financial transactions. 
CAPRICORN, The answer to a current question may not be supplied for another few weeks. In the meantime, you may firm up any new friendships and social links and develop all ideas you've had for doing a spot of good work. Think twice before going behind somebody's back as your plans may come unstuck. AQUARIUS If you are determined to follow through with plans which are bound to alter the working pattern of your life, then you must also be prepared for others to make their feelings known. Put minor details to one side and start to look at the larger picture. You need to consult the experts, so talk to people who know more than you. READ | On Call: A day with Delhi's ambulance staff 
TAURUS, An upheaval on the work front may have been delayed. Today's planets put the emphasis firmly on home and family, and you may have to face up to duties you'd hoped would go away! Your financial stars begin to look easier, so that's good news. Whether your costs are actually cut is another question! Follow Coronavirus LIVE Updates 
GEMINI, Mercurial alignments often bring out the best in your character. Today is therefore a moment for rapid thought, plenty of chat, and lively social visits. Don't let routine chores get in your way, for your first priority should be pleasure. CANCER The emotional pressure you've been under should now begin to lift, which means you are unlikely to experience any lows, but you may miss the highs as well. You might appreciate the drift towards a more settled existence, welcoming the opportunity to restore a sense of order. 
LEO, Now that the Moon is so strong, you can call the shots. There is no reason for other people to hold you back, and if they don't dance to your tune, that is their problem! In love, your dreams may be of a spiritual union rather than raw passion. Not that there's anything wrong with that! Follow Rajasthan Government crisis LIVE updates 
VIRGO, You may spend as much time as you like by yourself, and make sure that other people don't pry into your affairs or extract secrets which they have no right to know. For the business-minded, the best investments are to be found in the world of ideas or communication. 
LIBRA, You may still be wondering what hit you, or why other people seem so reluctant to apportion blame. At least, in future you won't have to work so hard to keep everything nice and pleasant. That task can be left to people who think they can do better. 
SCORPIO, Leisure activities are likely to be affected by certain long-standing ambitions, and the best course of action today is one which increases your status, prestige and self-confidence. Even romantic connections will be affected by your pride! On the other hand, there are people who might be put off if you appear to be too arrogant. 
SAGITTARIUS, Time has moved on, and old problems are really not so important. You can now begin to look at home and family affairs with fresh eyes, free from the uncertainties of the recent past. Never forget the lessons that have been learnt, and remember that sometimes the old ways are the best. Read | Silence on Depsang may be linked to Pangong resolution 
CAPRICORN, It's time for romantic optimism, perhaps to get in touch with loved ones who are far away, or who have been keeping themselves to themselves for far too long. You may bring travel plans up to date now, or risk a series of messy misunderstandings. And there's no point in that, now, is there? AQUARIUS You want to do your best, to be noticed and appreciated but, above all, it's a day for partnership, for taking care of loved ones, and for doing everything in a spirit of teamwork and co-operation. If others appear to be taking a lion's share, be gracious and give them their due. 
TAURUS, Your burden has been increasing over the past couple of months, but not necessarily in an unpleasant manner. Your problems could be those borne of success, and any frustration could arise from the fact that your expectations are increasing, perhaps beyond the point where they can be met. 
GEMINI, A new fact could offer the missing link, providing the answer to a long-standing question. Do pay more attention to business connections, however small the amounts involved. Somewhere along the line, your ideas have parted company with a friend's, but it's important that you see eye-to-eye. READ | Kurta Pajama: A typical Tony Kakkar song CANCER It's impossible to tell whether affairs of the heart or professional hopes are most important, but what is certain is that your deeper emotional aspirations are now being buffeted by a cosmic squall. Hang on tight and seek reassurance wherever you can. 
LEO, When you're dealing with finances, property, or anything which connects your prosperity to others, you must realise that there can now be no quick fixes. It may be necessary to devote more of your energy to partners' interests than your own, but not for too long - hopefully! 
VIRGO, You have been led a merry old dance by certain people. It's been fun, but it could be time to move on. Someone who once seemed so reliable has lost touch with circumstances and may no longer know what is needed. It's up to you to recreate harmonious conditions. 
LIBRA, There is no telling exactly what will happen now that other people have decided to go their own way, but if you have made your peace with authority you should be on a fairly safe path.  All that can be said with certainty is that nothing is certain, so keep your options open! READ | Severe lung damage, blood clots: Covid-19 signatures that linger 
SCORPIO, A major alteration in the pattern of your working life could be the consequence of personal changes. You could also be pleasantly surprised by the results. A trip to your romantic past may also soon be accomplished, but don't wait around waiting for someone to get in touch. Take the initiative! 
SAGITTARIUS, Recent emotional situations have absorbed much time and energy and left you feeling somewhat drained. However, the real problems may be other people's rather than yours, so please extend sympathy and support wherever and whenever it is required. 
CAPRICORN, You're still in the midst of sensitive, delicate and vulnerable planetary aspects, so if you feel slightly wobbly it's only to be expected. However, all artists should produce their best work, lovers could be about to hit a new peak and mystics will be reaching a fresh high! AQUARIUS Travel plans may have to be altered, mainly because your ideas are now changing, and some of the information on which you've been acting no longer seems to be valid. In love, it's now vital to talk about your feelings. If you don't tell other people what you want, then they can't be blamed for misunderstanding you. Read news on Rajasthan Government crisis; India Coronavirus Live Updates 
TAURUS, Unless a final agreement is reached now, it will be some time before you are prepared to re-open negotiations, perhaps because your ideas no longer seem so wonderful. You're entering a period which can best be described as one of contemplation, and your most interesting ideas will not be for public consumption.

GEMINI, Whatever is currently taking place either at home or at work, remember that you may be required to pay up. So, you should be very cautious and avoid all rash financial commitments. You might now be a good influence on people who have broken the rules once too often. CANCER Some personal pressures are easing, but others are waiting in the wings. You feel as if you should take control, but is that really wise? If you give yourself as long as you need to consider the consequences, you'll decide on the best course of action. Think things through! READ | Three stand-up comics post online apologies for ‘hurting sentiments' 
LEO, You have become involved in associations which could be helping your self-confidence. Only one question is now outstanding, and that is whether current relationships are based on genuine honesty and understanding. As a matter of interest, it's a suitable moment for telling someone how you really feel about them - in a positive sense, of course. 
VIRGO, You appear to be on the fringes of a rather complex emotional situation, for which there now seem to be two possible outcomes. Either it will all blow over, or it will be removed from your hands. One way or the other, you can afford to be more relaxed. 
LIBRA, The only way to form successful partnerships now is to do what you have always done best - compromise and consult. Plus, you can leave people at work to sort out what they want before attempting to reach firm decisions. After all, if they don't see eye-to-eye then joint plans are unlikely to get very far.

SCORPIO, What is difficult for other people could be very helpful for you. Therefore, please do concentrate on making the most of any and every opportunity which comes your way, even while you're helping partners out of any difficulty. Consider social arrangements carefully, because by tomorrow your needs will have changed. 
SAGITTARIUS, You can still make heavy weather of home and family matters, perhaps because you have been confused, even dumb-struck, by relatives' changes of mood or opinion. It is quite acceptable to press on with practical improvements without waiting for permission. 
CAPRICORN, Mercury is soon to alter its position so, if you've reached a firm decision, you may have to think again, even if only to confirm your original choice. The time for straight talking will return very soon, but until then you should concentrate on getting the facts straight, and on clearing up misunderstandings. READ | Twitter hack snags Obama, Biden, Gates accounts in Bitcoin scam AQUARIUS Maximum confusion is likely at work and in all routine chores, so if you drop, break  or lose vital items, you'll know why: it's all thanks to the muddling effects of  Neptune, delicately aligned with Venus and Mercury. Mind you, it's a fine moment for artists and lovers. 
TAURUS, Travel plans should be pushed up the agenda, for there will be no better way to lift your morale than to dream of foreign parts. Professionally, you can probably afford to rest on your laurels, but only until the next series of extraordinary demands arrives. 
GEMINI, Some reassuring aspects to your sign make it clear that your wishes are paramount. The nature of your lunar alignments could mean that, in the absence of fresh responsibilities, you'll have time to put your feet up. The clock is ticking away though, and a deadline could be here sooner than you think. CANCER It may not yet be the right time to play your trump cards, even though the pressures are growing. You'll be able to make a bigger splash in around two or three days' time, so hold your fire. At home, it's best to concentrate on what you can do to put matters right rather than worrying about what went wrong. 
LEO, There is so much that needs to be said, and so little time in which to say it, but one way or another you must prepare your ground properly. You will very soon realise that material security was not the real issue, and in future you may be more prepared to cut loose. 
VIRGO, You decided to alter your course or direction some time ago, but there is still time for the implications of your actions to sink in. Don't be surprised if partners are in the process of changing their minds, for they're only following your lead! You should have sympathy for their predicament. 
LIBRA, Times are still busy and getting more so by the day. For a while it looked as if you were about to return to square one at work, but this may no longer be the case. Everything is up for grabs. Some of you are feeling worn out, but you've learnt an important lesson - to pace yourself properly next time round. 
SCORPIO, This is a fine day to take care of joint financial arrangements, although it doesn't look as if anything particularly important will be decided. It will also be nice if you have a chance to spend someone else's money. Secret information could be revealed soon, so have your story ready. 
SAGITTARIUS, During the past few weeks you have probably imagined that loved ones and partners have taken leave of their senses - and you  could be right! But then you of all people should understand their need to be irrational and unpredictable! If you see the world through partners' eyes, then you'll expand your own horizons. 
CAPRICORN, You should take care to deal with all routine chores, paying every attention to all minor details. That's the only way to ensure that when the time comes to enjoy yourself, all cares and hassles are safely resolved. Don't let the past blind you to the pleasures of the present. AQUARIUS Sober Saturn's progress through your chart is now at a critical stage, suggesting that a plateau has been reached. It could therefore be time for a breather, and you should allow partners to take some of the strain. Step in to help as and when you feel you're needed. 
TAURUS, Two regions of your chart are particularly significant, one to do with business, the other connected to spirituality and mysticism. One logical and likely outcome could be a growing involvement in a charitable enterprise. At the very least you should look at what you can do for others, rather than at what they can do for you.

GEMINI, Your best course of action now could be to allow both professional and intensely personal matters to take their own course. Financially, consider imaginative proposals and purchases, but you should be very wary about committing yourself. CANCER Keep your thoughts to yourself if that is what you want, but realise that you will have to come clean by the end of the week. You should turn your attention to a legal matter or ethical question sooner rather than later, for the better other people understand your position, the sooner a solution will be reached. 
LEO, Try to recall what has happened over the past six months and understand exactly how your present situation developed. Then you will realise just how and why other people are depending on you. If someone is indeed relying on you then you are honour-bound to do your best by them. READ | Experts Explain: The case for using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 
VIRGO, Active social stars emphasise the extent to which you are now obliged to consult and collaborate at every turn. Your mission, at the moment, should be to simplify matters which have become unnecessarily complex. Turn for advice to people who are older, wiser, and have been here before. 
LIBRA, Your mind will be concentrated wonderfully on what exactly you need from other people, and on whether this is a time for being in love or holding yourself aloof or, more likely, fluctuating between the two! If you're confused, imagine how other people feel! READ | Sambit Patra tweets Dehradun ‘in Sanskrit' on station board, Railways says not changed 
SCORPIO, At heart you are quite a competitive person, and you're always ready for a fight. Right now, the battle is likely to played out at work, but you're probably concerned most with what people are thinking rather than what they're doing. You may shift unwanted responsibilities on to other shoulders. 
SAGITTARIUS, One set of stars indicates that you'll be tempted to gamble, another that whether you win or lose is not in your hands. You should realise that even in emotional risks, there is no way to calculate the odds in advance. So, what's the answer? The first thing is to make sure you've got a fall-back position.

CAPRICORN, You might not be able to persuade people in authority to alter their stance, so it could be up to you to shift your position. Even slight signs of flexibility on your part could enable other people to compromise. Any way of avoiding conflict has to be worth it. AQUARIUS Don't think too much about money as, in spite of appearances, that may not be the most important factor. What is important is that you keep other people up to date, otherwise they'll begin to think you don't care. It would be a shame if someone who has looked up to you decided that they were wrong.

TAURUS, The Moon's occupation of important regions of your chart is a symbolic indication that you hold the centre stage, and can therefore afford to dictate the pace. It's very much a favourable time for romantic Taureans, so let your imagination roam free. 
GEMINI, You are famous for your reliance on the facts, but there are times when even your legendary objectivity slips. You may do better to concentrate on creating a good impression in subtle and intuitive ways. If there is anything which you can do to ease a loved one's burdens, please do so as soon as you can. Read| Evidence of immunity is a glimmer, but data show lasting Covid-19 damage CANCER Strong social stars today reveal that even if you're at work you will have to pay great attention to partners' needs and desires. But if you're preoccupied with matters of a more personal nature then you may consider cancelling one particular engagement. Don't be hasty. 
LEO, Finances are obviously a major bone of contention, but probably because you know how well you could do if only you had the chance. The best advice now is to dream on and hope that your intuitions come up with the answer. Check your fantasies against the facts, though. 
VIRGO, It's not the facts and figures that are important, but the message behind them. You should therefore do everything you can to avoid being taken in by appearances. You might take all financial offers with a healthy pinch of salt, if only because other people don't seem to have your grip on reality.

LIBRA, Crucial planets are now aligned with the very foundations of your solar chart. You probably still feel that you're being under-cut, almost as if everything you have always relied on is being steadily eroded. Don't worry about it, for a very healthy change is under way. 
SCORPIO, You may have every reason to believe that you have been wronged, and now that misunderstandings seem to be present on a potentially grand scale, your suspicions may be confirmed. Or so you imagine! Always bear in mind that the truth may be the very reverse of what you think. 
SAGITTARIUS, If today is about anything, it's about trust. You may allow loved ones or close associates all the freedom of manoeuvre they need to succeed or fail. Even though they may be slightly muddled, in the final analysis they have to take responsibility for their own ideas and actions. And all you can do is offer constructive advice and support.

CAPRICORN, If you are now confronted with obstacles or challenges at home, don't hold back or, worse still, decide to give up altogether. Even quite small developments may seem like a mighty step into the unknown, so it's important that you boost your self-confidence. AQUARIUS What you have experienced recently may make you wonder if a complete break or separation is necessary. On the other hand, you may feel that, at a time when there is so much to play for, you shouldn't be too hasty. The same old thoughts are likely to be wandering around your mind for some time yet! 
TAURUS, Mars moves through your chart making some unusual celestial manoeuvres, giving many of you a second crack of the whip. Perhaps you have abandoned a task which may now be completed. Or there may be a wrong to right. If you are offered a golden opportunity then move fast, for time is limited. 
GEMINI, This is one of those weeks when you just can't have everything your own way. Sometimes it's wiser to back down or back off for a while, and now that Mercury, planet of good ideas, is so uncertain, you should give yourself extra time for careful thought. Feel free to put personal matters on the back burner. Read| Kanpur wala: The life, times and controversial death of Vikas Dubey CANCER The coming months should provide you with just the opportunity you need to put your finances on a more profitable footing, but a spot of belt-tightening may be vital in the meantime. Also, if possible, try to find ways to cut down on all those irritating chores. Family members may need help, so respond to calls for assistance. 
LEO, Your greatest quality is your open-hearted sense of fun. If someone has let you down, behaved badly or otherwise caused a fuss, there is no time like the present to make amends. However, thoughts of revenge should be replaced by generosity and a spirit of forgiveness. Read| Amitabh Bachchan, son Abhishek test positive for coronavirus 
VIRGO, The planets are certainly busy this week. One of your current problems is having too much on, all at once. On the other hand, there is nothing in your solar chart to suggest that this is not a generally auspicious phase and that family celebrations should not go as planned. 
LIBRA, Your stars are changeable  and unwilling to be tied down! You should kick off the week on good form, even though the Moon does tend to make your emotions just the tiniest bit more wobbly than usual. You may save shopping expeditions for midweek and keep a close watch on family engagements. 
SCORPIO, There seem to be so many calls on your time that you may be reaching breaking- point. However, if the financial situation is now easing, as it should be, you can look forward to spending your way to happiness. Try to surround yourself with beautiful objects  they will be good for your soul. Opinion| Priyanka Gandhi's eviction from accommodation is an opportunity to evict everyone else as well 
SAGITTARIUS, This is, all-in-all, an optimistic time, so keep your mind focused on the positive. Perhaps you are still rather hot and bothered about your long-term financial security, but now that the Sun is heading for new sectors, help is at hand. Over the next week you should follow up any odd plans for weird and wacky purchases. 
CAPRICORN, Nothing stays the same for long  as you know. Accept the fact that one cycle in your life has come to an end and another is beginning. If you realise that the past has gone forever, you will be in an ideal position to benefit from certain friendly and lively developments which are now just around the corner. AQUARIUS It's decision time. It would now seem that you must decide once and for all if a personal project should be pursued to its logical conclusion or abandoned. On no account should you allow other people to pressurise you into making a hasty choice. If they're in a hurry then that is their problem. 
TAURUS, The pleasure principle is never far away. In fact, it's a reasonable day for a spot of extravagance, especially if you're spending other people's money, but if you do splash out it could be because you're trying to avoid the implications of certain long-term commitments. 
GEMINI, A loyal partner is likely to require your full and undivided attention today, so listen sympathetically and give them the best advice you can. You should also be able to make a number of important decisions - and put them into practice! Help is close at hand, and all you need to do is ask. CANCER You may start to get a grip on business matters, and consider your long-term future. You still seem to be shelling out on the basis of promises made some time ago, but you'll probably be able to turn the tables next week. You have to be sympathetic to a partner's predicament, though.

LEO, Modern psychologists talk about your 'shadow', meaning all those qualities, characteristics and actions which you are reluctant to acknowledge, but are no less you for all that. For once you must face up to everything that has been swept under the carpet. You might even find something there to enjoy! 
VIRGO, Home and family matters are in for a brief overhaul. Rather than curbing relations' basic instincts, you should set out to encourage them to establish their own limits and explore their talents to the full. They might even acquire respect for your wise words and rich experience. 
LIBRA, An emotional or romantic commitment should now be up for review. One thing that everyone can rely on is that your mood is very serious, and that you will take the right decisions for everybody. That, at least, is the theory. In practice there may be one or two embarrassments along the way! 
SCORPIO, You're standing at a crossroads, and there are major personal and professional choices to make. However, your perspective should be different every day, and today's questions concern cash matters and financial security. See if there's any way you can cut costs. READ | Breathe Into The Shadows review: A preposterous web series 
SAGITTARIUS, You have a certain amount of responsibility for other people, mainly in terms of making sure that their interests and welfare are protected. But, if you feel like escaping to a far corner of the globe, the signs seem positive. You need a break - and soon! 
CAPRICORN, You may well feel like spending as much time by yourself as you can, dreaming about the future. If you are to be especially active today, it looks very much as if it will be charitable matters which grab you. It's time to go in search of sainthood, and earn your halo. AQUARIUS Stability and security are gifts which you can offer your loved ones and partners at the moment. This may go against the grain, but if you act out of character life will take a very interesting course indeed. You might even wonder why you never did it earlier!

Actually, you might be surprised by the person who offers you the best advice. Read | Vikas Dubey shot dead, police say he tried to flee 
GEMINI, You may spare a little time to consider your physical well-being, and do yourself a favour by lowering the level of emotional stress. It's not that tension is necessarily any greater than usual, just that this is a useful time to improve your morale. CANCER Astrologers often fail to realise how adventurous you can be at work, including voluntary tasks, and now is the time to surprise everybody by showing that you have hidden depths and talents that colleagues never even guessed at. You might even hear something to your advantage. 
LEO, Today's Solar alignments are among the most important of the month. You are likely to experience hold-ups and difficulties, but the result could be to push you into a life that is so much more worthwhile. Plus, there's little that you can't deal with by being perfectly charming. 
VIRGO, Venus steps up its influence very soon, maintaining a relationship with several planets, including Jupiter, which will help you win friends and influence people who have never been susceptible to your charms. You can therefore afford to feel encouraged about the future! Read | Avrodh trailer: Amit Sadh leads this web series on 2016 surgical strike 
LIBRA, You're at a turning point in both social and romantic affairs, although you may not see the results just yet. The key seems to be a greater desire for commitment, itself born of a need for security. Can you achieve this and maintain your independence? I think you can. 
SCORPIO, The coming clash of aspirations will be between your private desires on the one hand, and the way you want the world to see you on the other. Try to find a middle way, reconciling family pressures with career and public ambitions. It could be easier than you think. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a serious sort of a day, and you'll be in a mood to make long-term commitments. This may mean, of course, that current obligations come under scrutiny, and you might decide you're not pulling your weight. Mind you, the pleasure principle remains strong, so enjoy! 
CAPRICORN, You may now day-dream and fantasise to your heart's content. The plain fact is that once you start seriously exercising your imagination, you'll begin to see the way forward through some very down-to-earth matters, like the next step in a financial venture. Follow Coronavirus India live updates, read news from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana AQUARIUS Life's not always been easy, but nobody ever promised it would be! There is now a light at the end of one very long tunnel. You'll catch sight of it over the next few days, and even though it will then disappear again, it should help guide you to a successful conclusion and safe destination. 
TAURUS, It may be irritating to be tied to what friends have in mind, but unless you want to be a hermit you will have to accept that others' feelings must come first. In love, you should abandon unrealistic expectations of what romance should or shouldn't be about. 
GEMINI, Domestic relationships should be worked at. There's no point in blaming other people because such-and-such a thing may have gone wrong, or because you may not have got your way. The past is the past, and the future must be tackled with hope and courage. CANCER You will be unwilling to perform any task which doesn't suit your personal wishes and interests. You may therefore be a reluctant employee unless those in authority entrust you with taxing and interesting responsibilities. It's partly up to you, but also up to them! 
LEO, Home and family affairs really must take first place in your list of emotional priorities. Take some time out to try and understand what has been troubling relations, and offer them whatever moral support is required. You might do best to keep your doubts to yourself. 
VIRGO, If you're wondering where all the good luck has gone, hold on for just a little while longer. It might be that partners are due to have first bite of the cherry. And while you're making plans for the future, understand that the best to come out of the present time will be enhanced self-knowledge. 
LIBRA, You often feel undervalued and taken for granted, sometimes with good reason. Yet, now could be the perfect time to turn the tables on partners and make them see that you are to be taken seriously, and that your feelings are worth every bit as much as theirs. 
SCORPIO, You're still in the driving seat, so you should gain personally from much of what is going on. However, when life is moving your way you should make a determined effort to look after other people's interests as well as your own. They'll return the favour when the position is reversed. 
SAGITTARIUS, A mystery of sorts should soon be cleared up, but the answer may lie within rather than without. In other words, because of your own preconceptions, you have misinterpreted someone else's intentions. Your vivid imagination may be to blame, rather than awkward circumstances. 
CAPRICORN, A great deal depends on how you get on with other people, even at work. Emotional undercurrents and beliefs count for very much more than the facts. Even in business, partners seem to be influenced by the way things once were, rather than the way they are now. AQUARIUS It's no use imagining that you're not ambitious. If you do give way to false humility then you'll doubtless miss out on a major opportunity. Push yourself forward and you may open the way to emotional fulfilment, together with applause and acclaim from your peers. 
TAURUS, Partnership comes easily to you, even if you do tend to set high standards. You know better than most people that everyone has a story to tell, and by listening sympathetically you will discover more about your own life, and what you should be doing next. 
GEMINI, It looks very much as if it's one of those relatively sober days when routine affairs call. There's no problem here, for the more you achieve over the next forty-eight hours, the more time you'll have off in the future. It's a matter of pain now, pleasure tomorrow! CANCER There is a great deal to be said for raising the level of passion in your personal affairs. Don't be embarrassed about showing your feelings, and shrug off unsympathetic responses from people who don't understand you. Frankly, that's their problem! 
LEO, The celestial weather is in a state of change. You're still recovering from the unsteadying effects of the last lunar whirlwind, and today's emotional influences may remind you of just how upset you once were. You could soon have a chance to kiss and make up. 
VIRGO, You have to talk to close partners, sharing your hopes and seeking reassurance for your worries. Some people say that a problem shared is a problem doubled, but that's a risk you'll have to take. This is no time for keeping yourself to yourself out of some misapplied and false humility! 
LIBRA, Superficially, everything depends on the amount of cash in your pocket. On a deeper level, you should be able to see that financial concerns could be but a symptom of discontent in a personal relationship. Try to face up to your real needs and desires. 
SCORPIO, The Moon is still curiously aligned with your sign, and your renowned intuition should therefore be even more intense than usual. Such is your ability to pinpoint the truth that it's impossible to believe you're not fitted with psychic X ray spectacles! 
SAGITTARIUS, You do seem more keen than usual to keep yourself to yourself, and partners may be quietly bemused by your willingness to abandon a commitment. You have the right to change, and change you must. If partners want you to stay as you are, they might have to be disappointed! 
CAPRICORN, One of your unsung qualities is loyalty to your old friends, and today may bring fond and sentimental thoughts. You may even decide to get in touch with former lovers, or renew a long-lost contact, probably with very pleasant consequences. A family member should be suitably impressed! AQUARIUS There is a gap opening between the way you see yourself and the way others see you. The fact is that they are likely to be completely unaware of your inner doubts and insecurities unless you take the trouble to spell them out. I don't think a partner can read your mind! 
TAURUS, You've got a great deal on your plate, and if there's hard work to be done, try to get as much as possible completed as soon as you can. Your mood will change before long, probably because you'll become very much more aware of partners' feelings and needs. 
GEMINI, There's a hint of friction in the air, but you could be partly responsible. Once you give way to impatience then you will forget that other people have interests of their own, which don't necessarily overlap with yours. A little bit of mutual respect would go a long way! CANCER There's bound to be some opposition to your plans today, but nothing that can't be dealt with relatively easily. Everything revolves around your ability to take responsibility without flapping about or worrying that other people are undermining your efforts. 
LEO, You can still charm potential partners, and even twist other people around your little finger, but not for much longer. So, if you've got important proposals to make, press ahead without delay. Partners will thank you if you show a bit of determination. 
VIRGO, By the end of the day you should be very much more aware of the need to discuss your feelings in detail. It's only by facing up to desires, hopes or fears that you normally try to ignore, that you'll get an important relationship back on the straight and narrow. 
LIBRA, There is a great deal to say for being a little more extravagant than in the past. The last thing you want to do now is count your cash too closely, for that is the surest way to cut yourself off from new experiences. It goes without saying, of course, that you should stay within your means. 
SCORPIO, You are about to become much more confident, but only briefly. Put yourself on the emotional starting line, ready to seize any passing personal opportunity as soon as the Moon alters its position. Stay alert and keep an eagle eye open for welcome invitations. 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll begin to be aware that all is not as it should be. Any such doubts will be extremely useful, for this is nature's way of making you check very closely on every single arrangement and every minor detail. Even a close relationship could benefit from careful scrutiny. 
CAPRICORN, No doubt you have checked up on all the available social options, but you will have to wait a little while longer for others to get their act together. The planetary message is be patient, but be true to yourself. Some would say that there's nothing else you can do! AQUARIUS The Sun is now challenging several planets, including Saturn. You will face old difficulties with fresh vigour, opening the way to much deeper self-understanding, and therefore to greater control over your affairs. A younger friend may come up with the best advice. 
TAURUS, There are some profoundly favourable influences today, but they happen to be extremely subtle. It's all a matter of being very smart and alert to the slightest passing opportunity. It goes without saying that you should push yourself to the front of the queue. 
GEMINI, Mars' fascinating alignments are opening opportunities and presenting you with a number of awkward choices. It would be wrong to say don't take risks but, if you do, make sure you're prepared for the outcome. Remember, if you're in control then you'll be better placed to get the best. CANCER Your financial situation is undoubtedly extremely complicated, but this doesn't mean to say it's all bad. It's just that outgoings look set to exceed earnings, perhaps because old commitments are about to return to haunt you. Maybe a loved one can help. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Delhi 
LEO, For some inexplicable reason the past seems to hold a greater fascination for you than the present. The most difficult choices should now be over, though, and you may even be able to get away with sticking your head in the sand! Other people might still insist that you have to face up to awkward decisions, but that doesn't mean that they're right. 
VIRGO, There'll be moments when a secretive mood takes you over. In love, you're still tempted to shut yourself away with romantic partners and let the world pass you by. However, do bear in mind that any secrets will be revealed soon, so keep everything above aboard. 
LIBRA, The Moon is sailing gracefully through your chart today, which means that while you should be more in control of routine situations, your emotions will be heightened. You should therefore be very careful not to misunderstand perfectly innocent remarks. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
SCORPIO, Discretion is an absolute necessity today, but then that's something you're very good at. Professional complications have been getting you down, but you should do well out of new personal contacts. You'll soon have to decide whether to pursue a family rivalry, or call it quits for now. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's always important to link up with like-minded people, and never more so than now. You're about to experience a change in your emotional cycle, one which is going to lower your expectations, and hence make you much easier to please! The results should be to your liking. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Telangana/Andhra Pradesh 
CAPRICORN, Now is the time to redouble your efforts, complete routine tasks and get on top of everything that's been holding you back. Even an emotional mountain which once seemed impossible to scale will suddenly appear much easier to tackle. So what's changed? Perhaps it's you! AQUARIUS Take heart from all and any moral support which comes your way, and be sure to fight for your rights. It's not a matter of sticking to the letter of the law, but of trying to make other people see the spirit. It's all about the need for justice and fairness. 
TAURUS, Opportunities are coming your way. You have two choices. Either you may ride out the storm and risk losing control. Or you may actively seize the initiative and assert your presence, insisting that others pay attention to what you need and want. Thursday's lunar alignments offer you the key to personal success. 
GEMINI, It's certainly a busy time, but you seem to be rather under the weather, or in danger of succumbing to emotional stress. You may not see eye to eye with one particular colleague. The advice is to relax and see to it that you have sufficient time to yourself. Cancer Mars and Venus, planets of energy and desire, are especially active at the moment. Your stars are nothing if not passionate, but do remember that when strong feelings surface, they can swing either way. As the old saying tells us, love and hate are different sides of the same coin. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Delhi 
LEO, Your stars are a mixed bag this week. Although you have excellent reason for optimism, if you fail to take note of reality you may find that the ground is swept from under your feet. Deal with all disagreements, otherwise family members are liable to take offence. 
VIRGO, Follow lunar eclipse 2020 LIVE updates It's time to talk, and I don't just mean about day-to-day affairs. You've a lot on your mind and friends and relatives can't advise you unless they know what you're really feeling. If you are frank, open and honest now, you'll stand a better chance of avoiding potential misunderstandings towards the end of the week. 
LIBRA, The overwhelming impact of your planets is felt on your finances. There are some expensive purchases lined up, but far-sighted Librans will be concentrating on saving. It's also a serious time, a moment to contemplate life's many unanswerable questions. Try to find some space for yourself, reviewing your progress so far, and making plans for the future. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
SCORPIO, You're bound to be the centre of attention — at least for a few more days. All eyes are now on you, and when the Moon offers you its support early in the week, you will be challenged to display your social and healing skills. By this I mean that while other people are falling out, you must come to the rescue. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may be pulled up short by something that happens towards the end of the week. Your sense of self-preservation will stop you doing anything silly, but you'll still have to step in to help a close friend out of a tight spot. Someone at work may need placating, so do your best. 
CAPRICORN, Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Telangana/Andhra Pradesh Your social stars are becoming increasingly lively, but no less serious for that. Most of you were never that interested in small talk and now, more than ever, you'll want to mix with old friends and companions who offer some sort of close commitment. At work, focus on long-term plans. AQUARIUS Intense trends strengthen as your planets form and re-form their relationships. If you're contemplating either a change of job or a new community commitment, now is the time to pull out all the stops. Don't compromise your principles. Family life is on a fundamentally positive path, even if there is a glitch. 
TAURUS, A high proportion of Taureans will be working hard, even putting in some overtime. Those of you planning to put your feet up should keep active, for this is nothing if not a day to accomplish practical tasks. You'll be much happier if you feel that you have actually achieved something worthwhile. 
GEMINI, The crucial planetary patterns today are civilised and enlightened, which is rather splendid considering that you are coming up with some fascinating ideas. Everything looks poised for sound, practical decisions and thoroughly sensible conversations! CANCER You need to sit down and talk to people at home, if only to get something off your chest. The key to a successful future is consultation and co-operation, so don't go off on a Cancerian tangent. You may do best to stick to familiar paths, and hone the solutions you've applied already. 
LEO, There will be a number of occasions when you must bite your lip if you are to avoid offending someone quite needlessly. Whatever your reasons or motives, you must remember that other people don't necessarily see the world in the same way as you, and you need to respect their points of view. Read| Some hospitals selected for clinical trials caution against ‘impossible' timeline 
VIRGO, You may be concerned by personal plans, but all new developments in your chart hinge on professionalism and high finance. It's probably that business and pleasure will begin to merge, perhaps because a loved one shows you the way to fulfil a worldly ambition. 
LIBRA, The next few weeks are likely to be crucial, and quite probably decisive in shaping your personal affairs over the next twelve months. Today's helpful alignments are ideal for rational thought and reasonable decisions, and favourable for family initiatives. 
SCORPIO, Read| Vaccine by August 15: Scientists say ICMR claim absurd and risky By some strange celestial quirk, your current planets hold a supremely Scorpionic phase of life; intense, secretive and mystical. Today, though, brings an entirely contradictory pattern of light-hearted conversation. Can you handle it? Yes, but only if you take partners' promises with a touch of healthy scepticism. 
SAGITTARIUS, If life is like a card game then I must tell you that your fellow players hold most of the trumps. Therefore, in love, at work, at home and at play, you must think very carefully before making your move. There's no reason why you can't win: it's all in the timing. 
CAPRICORN, A colleague is about to come to your aid, but what takes place over the next few days may not be public knowledge until next week or even the coming month. Whatever your personal situation, this is a day to stay busy and do what you're best at - or risk boredom. Read| India, China attend BRICS meet hosted by Russia AQUARIUS In many ways you are happy for current conditions to remain as they are, at least for a little while longer. What is decided now could have very far-reaching and practical consequences, probably way beyond your wildest dreams. It now looks as if partners will have to agree and admit that you were right all along! 
TAURUS, As the Moon sweeps through your chart, it forms a most tempestuous relationship with Pluto, one which can raise your passions, but also makes partners more intense. It is therefore incumbent on you to emphasise the need for charm, good manners and considerate behaviour. 
GEMINI, Something still seems to be eluding you, and you may fall prey to certain secret fears or suspicions. However, while the facts may still be obscure, in your heart you know the exact truth. It's just a matter of putting it into words - and making partners understand. CANCER Complicated planetary aspects denote that all forms of partnership are now up for review. That said, personal complexities may be avoided if you wish to socialise and go around in a gang. And if you want to tell someone just how you feel about them, do so while the going is good. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Delhi 
LEO, It is better by far to stick to conventional methods or tactics and prove by your behaviour just how experienced you are. Keep a weather eye open for hysterical employers and rogue authority figures, early in the afternoon. If you see trouble coming, keep your head down. 
VIRGO, There is no need to rush just because you're over-conscious of your deadlines. If you wish to put a precious scheme on hold for another few months, you may do so. It's not a question of abandoning the race, but of giving yourself sufficient time to make a go of it. 
LIBRA, Many people close to you have hopes for the future. Some may make extravagant gestures, but you are far too wise to be caught out. Even if some sort of unwanted financial outlay is inevitable, you should still adopt a cautious stance in other personal affairs. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Telangana/Andhra Pradesh 
SCORPIO, Your fixed, intense, emotional nature may crave security, but there will be moments when you feel like risking it all. In a sense it is your determined pursuit of the truth which leads you into such tricky situations. You will need to compromise, but the circumstances will be different in each case. 
SAGITTARIUS, The theme for the day is hard work, loyalty and the willingness to fulfil obligations. If you continue to bide your time and remain above the fray, you are bound to end up with your reputation and good name intact. If you bend the rules, then you may lose a friend. 
CAPRICORN, Take great care in anything you say or write, especially if you are chasing professional promotion, or dealing with authority figures or parents. It is necessary to be clear and practical, but also to be very considerate about a close partner's feelings. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Maharashtra AQUARIUS If you still feel that you will never be able to transcend or surmount certain serious financial obstacles, you are totally wrong. The first step in this, as in a number of personal affairs, is to realise just how much you rely on other people's help and assistance. 
TAURUS, Your chart today is what astrologers call 'exalted'. This one word should be enough to convey the impression that you are well on the way to improvements in the quality of your life. The respect you deserve is coming, and will be very gratifying when it finally arrives. 
GEMINI, There is only one thing left to say at home but, exactly what, is not clear from your chart! Having fitted one last piece into the jigsaw you may be able to go your own way and leave family relationships to look after themselves. Hopefully, other people will now co-operate. CANCER A plethora of planetary patterns progresses slowly through your horoscope. As they do so, you will become happier with your ideas and more successful in setting the pace at home. You will also cook up a new way of making one of your major ambitions come true. Follow LIVE updates coronavirus situation in Delhi 
LEO, Prosperity is indeed on the way. It just so happens that one very particular planetary alignment indicates a well-deserved increase in your earnings. I earnestly hope that the promise of the stars comes to pass! What you have to do, though, is take the initiative. 
VIRGO, The down-to-earth and the ultra-mundane will be intricately tied to the profound and the long-term. Therefore don't dismiss apparently meaningless people or events out of hand, for they may eventually have great significance. The most trivial developments may well be the most important. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Maharashtra 
LIBRA, This is the section of the week during which you should begin to think about money. Your solar chart denotes excellent financial skills, so I have no doubt that you are now poised to pick up a few bargains. Even when selecting partners, you need to shop around! 
SCORPIO, Sometimes you are guilty, like any ordinary mortal, of crossing the road and walking past when you see trouble. However, the impact the Sun has had recently indicates that for the next month you should make a point of helping people who are much worse off than you. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus situation in Telangana/Andhra Pradesh 
SAGITTARIUS, The current tendency in your chart is very much towards devoted hard work and dedication to your responsibilities. Even relationships must be worked at, otherwise events will slip from your grasp. As soon as that happens, then you'll have to deal with circumstances that you thought had been finished with. 
CAPRICORN, We cannot live by bread alone. What a remarkably true statement that is, and how amazingly relevant to your current circumstances. If you keep your eyes fixed doggedly to the ground, marvellous opportunities will fly by unseen. Raise your sights to the skies! Read | Chinese firms barred from road projects, investing in MSMEs AQUARIUS Only when others have been put right in no uncertain terms will you be able to get your way at home. However, it may be another few days before you have the very genuine satisfaction of having been proved right. Even then, you may not receive an apology! 
TAURUS, You may feel slightly resentful at the apparent ease with which other people are able to exploit you or treat you like part of the furniture. However, one way to fit in is to go along with the trend and be charitable, recognising the ways in which you can help strangers. 
GEMINI, Your new planetary developments are generally favourable. Perhaps you will now have a bit of time to stop, think and separate the lies from the truth. Someone has certainly been spinning a line, even though they probably believe every word of it. CANCER If you're a true Cancerian, you should come out from under your stone and head for the number one job. Forget past embarrassments and realise that everyone makes mistakes, not just you! You should also try to convince a friend or loved one that your feelings are genuine. 
LEO, It's good to give up when you are ahead. In view of current developments, you should look at whatever area of life is doing very well and do what you can to maintain your current position while beginning to put your energy elsewhere. Your timing must be perfect! 
VIRGO, It would do you a power of good if you got your financial situation on a proper footing. There will be suggestions and schemes coming up over the next year which require an injection of cash, and it will obviously be very useful if you are solvent. 
LIBRA, You may be puzzling over a mystery, or perhaps straining to keep a secret. My advice would be to maintain discretion for a little while longer, perhaps until the weekend. This shouldn't inhibit you from doing what you know to be right, or from setting a good example. 
SCORPIO, Just a quick word about your physical well-being: it looks as if you may be overdoing it. Indeed, some of you have already overdone it, so take as much rest and relaxation as you need to get back on course. You really should maintain a balance between competing pressures. 
SAGITTARIUS, There is so much planetary activity aligned with ambitious regions of your chart that you might now expect to receive public acclaim. But for what? All the signs are that your skills as an entertainer may soon be most admired, perhaps to your surprise. 
CAPRICORN, There are no signs that your chart is any less sensitive than before. Neither are you about to become any less assertive. What you must learn now is the art of avoiding banana skins. On a more mundane note, you can draw various domestic threads together, today. AQUARIUS You can't always be putting yourself under pressure to get things done, and in many ways this is a day to relax and take stock. At home help may come from a surprising source, while at work an employer may hold out the prospect of increased money or status - but will the price be worth it? 
TAURUS, There is no reason why everything should be black and white, and you must expect another day when all is not quite clear. The most ideal way to get the very best out of your planetary aspects is to enjoy your dreams and follow your instincts. Wear your sense of humour on your sleeve. 
GEMINI, Although you're renowned as a communicative sort of a person, team-work is not always your major strength. Somehow you now have to find a way of fitting in while at the same time asserting your very individual and totally unique version of what is needed. CANCER Forget your sensitive, retiring Cancerian qualities. Today it is time to bring out a different feature of your celestial personality, being more ambitious, tough and ruthless. Also, as a matter of urgency, expect the unexpected! You can never be too prepared. 
LEO, Venus is happy sailing through your chart, but will soon bring changes to your romantic hopes. Take all opportunities to enjoy yourself, but, bearing in mind the general irresponsibility inherent in today's mighty planetary aspects, you will have to decide where to draw the line. 
VIRGO, Powerful financial indications continue for a little while longer, but in view of the fact that the stars indicate carelessness and loss, you must question all ambiguous claims and suspicious details. Somebody may have misled you, probably without meaning to. 
LIBRA, I am afraid that you will have no choice but to listen to what other people are saying. If you do try to close your eyes or avert your gaze then you will actually provoke them into even louder announcements and proclamations! That doesn't mean that their words will suddenly make sense, though! 
SCORPIO, Keep up the hard work! Even if you are taking time off then you should keep active and flexible. If you adopt a narrow and dogmatic course, the ground may be swept from under your feet. Also, if you make a rash promise then a partner might take you at your word. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you are in tune with the heavens, then you have managed to extend a period of hope and opportunity. It's almost as if you are enjoying a sort of personal emotional revival. Do not feel bad about enjoying yourself if other people are working, and don't let them put you down or make you feel small. 
CAPRICORN, The only way to function today is to throw out every prejudice and pre-conception. This is something at which you excel, in spite of your rather undeserved stuffy astrological reputation. If you start again with a blank slate then you might realise that you misjudged a partner, and that they underestimated you. AQUARIUS There is much to be done that still seems to concern your long-term future. If you have lost sight of a number of goals, use your current planetary energies wisely to talk to the experts, chat to friends and seek advice from every corner, especially from people who have been here before. 
TAURUS, It's not always a good idea to reveal all. In fact, you do seem to have something to be secretive about. All things considered, I'd say that so sudden and so curious is the current change in direction, that it may be the end of the week before you discover what is really going on. Follow Coronavirus India LIVE Updates 
GEMINI, You may throw yourself into social engagements with one hundred and one percent enthusiasm. It's a wonderful day for differences of opinion, so if you have anything to get off your chest, do so today. The one qualification is that you must stick to the facts. CANCER The time will come when you have to consider a professional or other worldly ambition in a new light. The only way to learn is to make mistakes, so don't worry about whether something is going to work out as planned. Just do it! You'll get it right next time.

LEO, Today's energetic lunar alignments are splendid for all Leos everywhere. Focus on all adventurous schemes, throw caution to the wind and let yourself go. Hopefully, partners should take care of the practical ramifications. If they don't, then you can always sort them out in a few days' time. 
VIRGO, Fortunate planetary pressures are set to produce increased prosperity and popularity for poor old Virgo! Help might come from where it is least expected, perhaps in the form of hard cash, hopefully within the next three days. If nothing happens now, then you might have to wait for another month! 
LIBRA, The Sun extends its bountiful influence over you, indicating that a significant season is continuing. You may feel as if a family member is giving you a sideways push, temporarily knocking you off your perch. However, the lesson may be a salutary and much needed one.

SCORPIO, The theme for the day is hard work. In every area of life, even if you're pursuing a romantic goal, you should push yourself to the limit. There could be satisfactory developments for those of you contemplating major domestic upheavals, mainly because you're more determined than you were in the past. 
SAGITTARIUS, As from now you should begin to allocate a higher priority to your creative powers and instincts. Today's forceful lunar alignment suggests that this is a positive time to lay your feelings on the line. Just make sure that you've got the facts straight.

CAPRICORN, A number of planetary cycles reach critical points today. Ambitious Capricorns are about to hit an assertive professional phase but, before then, all Goats must make the necessary adjustments at home. You can't afford to overlook any detail, no matter how small. AQUARIUS Today's harmonious planetary picture offers you the chance to conduct a minor revolution in almost whatever area of life you choose. Financially, keep a tight rein on family spending, and a close watch on younger relations. You need to know where to draw the line. 
TAURUS, A wonderfully sociable atmosphere offers plenty of relaxation with pleasant partners, so set out to have fun. However, seeing as your current emotional cycles are sober, serious and intense, mature activities are bound to predominate. For example, you may attract people who are more experienced. 
GEMINI, This period should start on the right note although, you will have increasing difficulty in taking rational decisions. But, when all is said and done, there is nothing wrong with following your deeper beliefs, just for a change. Besides, sometimes you need to follow your intuitions. READ | First signs of trouble in Pangong was last September, days after Ladakh became UT Cancer You have every reason to be well pleased with your progress over the past few months. Now, however, you are reaching a genuine turning-point under a striking astrological alignment that last occurred ages ago. Make the most of it. And don't turn down an invitation now in the expectation that it will be renewed next month. 
LEO, Friends and relations certainly have the right ideas. What is more important is that they have the force of personality to make sure that their proposals are put into effect and that your own desires may have to wait for a while. You may therefore have to grin and bear it, making a virtue out of necessity. READ | Can you see me as I am, an Indian Chinese? 
VIRGO, It's a good time to pull strings, sound people out and try to get a word into an influential ear. What is really favouring you at the moment is Mars' impact on your house of romance and creativity. As Venus, lady of love, comes into the picture, and combines with other favourable planets, you may receive romantic opportunities. 
LIBRA, Once personal affairs are dealt with you'll be giving thought to cash and career matters. Heed the comments put forward by friends and lovers as you'll get a fresh slant on things and you might even gain useful information. As you move into gear, your romantic prospects will pick up as well, which has to be a good thing. 
SCORPIO, You often get the feeling that your life is subject to forces so great that they are beyond your control. However, the occupation of sensitive regions of your chart by Mars and Pluto, your two special ruling planets, means only one thing: the ball is now firmly in your court. Decide where you want to be in a month. Read| FIR against 5 over Covid ‘medicine' claim: Ramdev, Patanjali MD booked for ‘cheating' 
SAGITTARIUS, Take heart, for the financial situation can now only improve. When we look at the fact that Jupiter, your planetary ruler, is so helpful, the outcome of recent economic ups and downs will be a period of sustained prosperity. Younger people may come up with the best advice. 
CAPRICORN, The cosmos is treating you handsomely at the moment. The one mistake you mustn't make is to regard every difficulty as a sign that the planets have got it in for you. In fact, they are sending you lessons to learn and challenges to overcome, the net result of that is you will be far more skilled at handling personal relationships.

TAURUS, You may give extra-special attention to relationships with children and younger relations, and seek much-needed improvements - wherever possible. Make the fulfilment of your own unique talents the priority, rather than always doing what other people want. 
GEMINI, You may still be pre-occupied with tangled emotions at home, although the general drift seems to be extremely positive. You are easily provoked at the moment, so if partners seem determined to irritate you, take a deep breath before responding. CANCER Your mood looks increasingly lively, and your hidden nomadic tendencies may be coming out - so you could be smitten by an attack of wanderlust. However, what is most important at the moment is to explain yourself properly, and banish all misunderstandings.

LEO, It's time for a spot of moderate extravagance, and it's surprising how a few extra treats can lift your morale. You should also be free with your feelings, and avoid placing any financial value on emotional relationships - don't judge other people by how much they earn. 
VIRGO, You should be on top form, and this is certainly no time for regrets. The present is the gateway to the future, and the way you handle your personal affairs now will colour your life over the next twelve months. You're creating your future right now - and that's quite a thought. Also Read | Trend of decline in daily deaths offers glimmer in Maharashtra 
LIBRA, You may be in a relatively quiet mood today, which means that if you've arranged sociable activities you may be dreaming of being by yourself! By the evening you should be feeling more on top of things. If there's a lesson, then it's to keep your options open. 
SCORPIO, You may feel that you have been slighted or wronged, but there might not be much that you can do about it. It's far better to turn away from strife and get on with personal ambitions and treasured friendships. The people you need to mix with are those who have stood by you. Also Read | Status quo ante the goal, India digs in for long haul 
SAGITTARIUS, You have certainly had a lot to put up with, but there is much to be thankful for as well. People who have been rather rough with your feelings should be balanced by those who are helping you to discover your desires. Perhaps the friends you need most are those who can appeal to every side of your personality. 
CAPRICORN, Leave your doubts and qualms to one side and seize all passing chances while you can. You really won't know what you like until you've tried as many different activities and lifestyles as possible. And don't let your beliefs unduly restrict your experiences. AQUARIUS There seem to be a lot of calls on your resources at the moment, and there may be nothing you can do but to spend your valuable funds. You can, if you wish, go with the stars and exploit the chance to be extravagant. But it's up to you to make sure that every crumb of cash is well-spent. 
TAURUS, All artistic and creative types are favoured by today's compassionate Moon. If you don't think that you fall into this bracket, you can still do your best to be spontaneous and develop those unique and wonderful gifts that you have always ignored. 
GEMINI, It's time to go back to first principles and start from scratch. This does mean dealing with left-over family questions, as well as all those lingering practical domestic chores. But it's also important to have a vision of the future, just to put everything into context. CANCER You have done extremely well in many respects, but there is still some way further to go. Over the next few days, you may gather fresh information, discuss your plans and re-arrange some of your long-held opinions about what is right and what is wrong. 
LEO, There seems to be some sort of power struggle going on, and superficial causes of disagreement, such as money, could be nothing more than a distraction. If your personal plans and ideas become the centre of attention, you may concede that you might just be wrong for a change! Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates 
VIRGO, There's a wonderful world waiting just around the corner - in your dreams! Today's bold lunar alignments encourage flights of fancy. If you're ready, then you may set your imagination free, leave daily concerns to take care of themselves, and focus on what could be, instead of being weighed down by what is. 
LIBRA, Forget all petty concerns and trivial details. If you can see beyond surface appearances, you'll glimpse the timeless reality concealed behind the daily facade. You should listen to your imagination and follow your dreams. You don't know where they'll lead, but you'll never find out unless you look! 
SCORPIO, Social life could be taking a turn for the better, and your romantic hopes should be high. Do be aware, though, of the risks of over-committing yourself financially, and only make promises you know you can fulfil. Give yourself a way out until you're absolutely sure. Follow India-China border dispute LIVE updates 
SAGITTARIUS, You should find that other people are much better able to take care of themselves, which means that you can concentrate on long-term ambitions. It's time to shape up to new responsibilities, particularly if you have some favours to return. 
CAPRICORN, Today's super stars hold out superb prospects for all Capricorns planning to start a new course of study, fight a legal battle or travel overseas. In all matters it is necessary to seize the moral high ground. Plus, there's a chance that what is good for you may be even better for others. Read | In Bhagalpur silk hub, looms tell a story: ‘95% collapse' AQUARIUS The time looks right for taking a treasured relationship one stage deeper, entering a new level of intensity. It also happens to be an ideal moment for making extraordinarily profitable investments, so keep a look-out for passing opportunities. 
TAURUS, The fact that there could be a gradual relaxation of your overall mood doesn't mean that you should let up your guard. While certain people will be all sweetness and light, some individuals will be out to create havoc. Steer a careful course, and avoid the traps set for others. 
GEMINI, Everything now focuses on your personal life, and if you know what's good for you, you will nip domestic discontent in the bud. Don't be hard on people, but do be firm, including with yourself. A little bit of discipline and determination will enhance your chances. CANCER Questions of cash drift to the front of your mind. If you wish to spend the day shopping, or even just window-shopping, that's fair enough. Although it looks as if necessities make a better buy than luxuries, the important thing is to pamper yourself - and feel good. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates 
LEO, If you do feel like sounding off at other people, then please make sure you hit the right target. If you are able to be completely saintly, and are in a mood to polish your halo, replace resentment and suspicion with compassion for the human predicament. 
VIRGO, There's a new set of lunar alignments approaching fast and, when it does finally arrive, it will signify an emotional turning-point. This, more than anything, is why you should welcome change rather than digging in your heels. There is nothing to fear, just as long as you keep your eye on the ball. 
LIBRA, You should be just a little more cautious about making social commitments over the next few days, for when it comes to the crunch you would rather be by yourself. It's all a question of picking and choosing, and hanging out with the people who make you feel fine. Follow India-China border dispute LIVE updates 
SCORPIO, Don't be bashful about being self-centred. If you don't promote your own interests when you have the chance, you'll be no use to partners at other times. Romance is the one area where you should put others' feelings first, just as long as you don't let them walk all over you. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's not what happens to you that's important as much as what action you take on your own behalf. This is therefore one of those times when you can alter the world around you by rearranging your opinions, strange as it may seem. An improvement in attitude now leads to a change in action down the road. IN PICS | Satellite photos show how the situation changed along the LAC 
CAPRICORN, Clear the decks of outstanding emotional business, ready for a positive end to an intimate phase. Deal with personal frustrations and financial passions today, and don't let other people push you into saying anything you'll regret. And if you're waiting for an apology, don't hold your breath! AQUARIUS There are times when the emotional current knocks you sideways, but you have your feet planted firmly on the ground at the moment. You should therefore be able to pick yourself up - and even feel better for the experience. In the background, by the way, family responsibilities are building up. 
TAURUS, You may well feel as if people at home are too clever by half. What relatives will fail to realise is that they are confusing their feelings with their thoughts. You may give them more space to work out their own desires, and even provide some practical back-up. 
GEMINI, The best way to handle your feelings is to talk about them. Family members could be surprisingly responsive, and you'll clear up some of your own uncertainties in the process. Financial concerns may be given a rest, perhaps because there are fresh figures to come in. CANCER Your emotional security is an important issue, and you should be aware that financial worries can be a substitute for coping with deeper concerns. Bear in mind that family decisions are now in the pipeline, and that you really can't finalise your plans until partners know what they're doing. Follow coronavirus in India live updates 
LEO, The Moon is now due to step up its emotional presence, which will account for an increase in the romantic temperature. There is nothing to be gained from keeping your feelings to yourself, but you must be clear about your motives - because, if you're not, then you can't expect anyone else to understand you, either! 
VIRGO, You can afford to be secretive, especially as far as family plans or domestic matters are concerned. Nobody has a right to probe into your affairs, and you must choose the time and place to tell others how you feel. Of course, once you've decided what you want to say, you have to find the right words. 
LIBRA, Lift your social horizons and be prepared to make friends with new people. Even at work, your personal skills will come in useful, especially if you can get other people on your side, making valuable allies for the future. There's a great deal to be said for listening to wiser, more experienced people, by the way. READ | Choreographer Saroj Khan hospitalised 
SCORPIO, You should now be prepared to take responsibility for others, although it won't be easy. It's better to see yourself as serving humanity. In love, it's important to be as generous with others as possible. If you count the cost now, then they'll remember it! 
SAGITTARIUS, Lunar alignments today are almost ideal for classic activities, like getting together with people who understand you, body and soul. Everything tends to emphasise your optimism and desire to explore life's highways and byways. Once you've worked out the odds, you may even put your innate caution to one side. Follow India-China Border News Live Updates 
CAPRICORN, This is certainly a moment to look at business options. If you're in the housing market, or otherwise planning large domestic purchases, you will have doubts, perhaps very useful ones. Press ahead with caution, guarding your rear and bearing in mind that there may be surprises around the next corner. AQUARIUS If you have been taking people for granted, you are about to be woken up with a jolt. You will discover, as so many others have before you, that complacency is a dangerous condition! Keep your wits about you and you'll sail through smoothly. READ | Govt asks Ramdev to explain Covid medicine claim 
TAURUS, The best way to deal with family members, or with anyone you live with for that matter, is to talk to them. The more that goes unsaid, the greater the chances that you'll drift into some sort of major misunderstanding. And that would never do. Not after all you've been through! 
GEMINI, Cash, including your need for more with the demands on your pocket, is one major issue. However, there's always a psychological dimension, and right now this includes your own need to be valued more in the future. Start by finding ways to boost your self-esteem. CANCER There is a great deal to be said for pressing ahead with all personal hopes and ambitions as fast as possible. The very best that you can hope for is that little opportunities will drop into your lap, unasked for. Your task will be to make the most of them. 
LEO, Nothing is quite as it seems, so don't worry if you can't think straight at the moment, but do try to separate fact from fantasy. This is not to say that one is better than the other, just that you should be sure in your own mind whether you're dealing with the real world or not! 
VIRGO, Stress levels tend to build up, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. A love affair will work best if you understand that friendship is more important than passion. You may already sense that emotional changes are on the way, and should realise that they are to be positively welcomed. 
LIBRA, In love, it looks very much as if secrecy is still the order of the day. It may be that other people are not yet ready to understand your feelings, but there could also be a slight lack of confidence on your part. Mind you, perhaps a few doubts are a good thing! 
SCORPIO, Set your sights high today and go for adventurous options. However, you should keep an eye on authority figures, including employers, who are developing strange ideas, especially if it looks as if they may pass judgment on your behaviour. You don't want to miss out! 
SAGITTARIUS, Monetary rewards are no doubt overdue, but if you can possibly get financial loose ends tied up today, you'll clear the decks ready for tomorrow. What is ultimately more important, though, is recognition of your talents. It's good to have cash in your pocket, but better to feel that other people honour your achievements, however small. 
CAPRICORN, Partnership is extremely important. This is not necessarily for any wonderfully selfless reason, but because, for sheer self-interest, you must link up with individuals who think and feel as you do. You can do without people who always criticise you, at least for now. AQUARIUS The dominant daily pattern in your chart is still work, but the possible manifestations are many. Even if you're planning to put your feet up, you may find that the most fulfilling way to spend the day is performing little favours for others. It's good to do good! 
TAURUS, If there is to be a theme for the week, it should be that arguments can be positive - and that it's good to clear the air. The favourable way to harmonise your life with today's stars is to set out to take decisions and open new lines of communication. 
GEMINI, You're still receiving a valuable shot of energy from Mars' relationship with your sign but, in general, the situation is looking rather less organised. So, if you do have practical tasks to complete, you must be sure to step up your level of concentration. Follow India-China border dispute LIVE updated CANCER The Moon's friendly presence is a definite plus, but the fact that it's your personal ruler is an additional sign that you can afford to raise your sights. If you're making plans for tomorrow, though, understand that circumstances may have changed before twenty-four hours have passed - and that there might be extra costs. Weekly Horoscope, June 21-27, 2020: Gemini, Libra, Aries, Leo, Virgo, Pisces, Scorpio, Aquarius and other signs 
LEO, You're about to face some hard decisions, not all of which will be of your own making. Today you can spend as much time as you wish day-dreaming, for your fantasies will point the way to the truth. Mind you, if you want respect, then you'll have to earn it. 
VIRGO, This is a special time of year, and you should move forward with confidence and faith in your future. Set yourself up for a positive time by seeking allies at work and planning social initiatives at home. Just one word of caution though - secret feelings could be about to become public. Read | Don't want escalation but if China acts, give reply: Rajnath to top brass 
LIBRA, It's time to indulge your ambitions and accept responsibility over others. This is something you often tend to avoid, in spite of the fact that, as current developments should demonstrate, you are able to handle your duties with unique skill. 
SCORPIO, Pay attention to the legal situation and make sure that you are well aware of your rights. It's a positive moment for travel, although any delays could be caused by family members or home commitments. Take simple precautions now and you'll thank yourself in future. Read | Five pregnant girls among 57 Covid-positive inmates in Kanpur shelter 
SAGITTARIUS, The strongest emerging theme in your solar chart is a desire for prestige and status, and this will obviously help those of you planning professional promotion. Your daily planetary patterns, though, focus on your need to sort out joint financial affairs. 
CAPRICORN, You must pay extra attention to family members' needs today, for if they are not satisfied they have ways, even unintentionally, of sabotaging your hopes in return. Scratch their backs and they'll scratch yours. That's the way the world works! Read | In 1962, when Lata, Rafi songs echoed in Galwan Valley AQUARIUS Stay busy and realise that a day spent coping with routine chores need not be dull. Also, check up on your physical situation and take steps to get in shape, cleaning up your diet and exercise. After all, your body is a shrine, as the mystics always tell us. 
TAURUS, Your personal planets are in a mischievous mood. It seems that you may now be deeply attracted to someone who completely fails to notice your abundant charms. Towards the end of the current period you may decide to make a complete break with your emotional past, even if it does mean upsetting someone. Read | Horoscope Today, June 22, 2020: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Libra, Pisces, and other signs - check astrological prediction 
GEMINI, Family affairs are moving forward in a positive manner. Work is also on your mind this week, and you may have to rely on your own resources to a far greater extent than in the past. Perhaps there will be a staff shortage. Or perhaps an employer will take a different view of your talents. Cancer It would do you no good to make precise forecasts for how this period will turn out, for you are in a position to break away from all your past circumstances. If you follow your dreams and pursue your almost mystical vision of life, you will have a bright future. 
LEO, You're in for a busy professional period, and it may be important to reschedule some of your less pressing engagements. Probably the best way to get what you want is to team up with people who are older than you, or at least have more skill, wisdom and experience. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

VIRGO, A financial breakthrough you have been waiting for could be closer than you think. Your ideas will be perfectly workable, so don't lose sight of them whether they affect your routine chores or purely personal aspirations. A romantic bonus gives you a boost at the end of the week, which should come as a pleasant surprise. 
LIBRA, People you meet now will fall into two types. There are people who are deep, intense and liable to get carried away. On the other there are those whose outlook will be overwhelmingly serious and who will help you keep your feet firmly on solid ground. Helpful strangers will come to your aid. Read | With over 15,400 new cases, India crosses 4 lakh-mark; toll at 13,254 
SCORPIO, Never again should you worry that Fate is about to overwhelm you. Instead, you should put on a smiling face and ask others for all the help and practical assistance that you need. Life is not only a question of emotional survival, but also of getting what you want for your physical happiness. 
SAGITTARIUS, The one word of warning now is that Mars may make you rather jumpy and inclined to become aggressive with people who have done nothing to earn your hostility. The problem is that you're liable to feel a little irritated, or angry, while the causes of such feelings are impossible to pin down. 
CAPRICORN, Romantically, this could be a deeply secretive phase, and you will resent partners' attempts to keep an eye on your movements or pin your feelings down. Discreet encounters could soon become public knowledge, though, so stick to your normal integrity. At work, stay with existing agreements — at least for now. AQUARIUS If you are to make the current situation crystal-clear you must get back to the drawing-board and work out exactly what it is that you want. One complication is that Venus, goddess of love, is tending to obscure your romantic feelings. And as long as you're not sure what you feel, you should not be making rash promises. 
TAURUS, Your generous instincts mean more than ever that you must now be prepared to lend a hand to those in need in whatever ways are most appropriate. You seem to be able to offer sound advice, assist financially and assume responsibility, all at the same time! 
GEMINI, Reality may not match your ideas of how things should be done. But, you must trust that, in the wake of the last set of lunar alignments, the right doors will be opened. All you have to do is seize your chances as they come. I know that's easier said than done, but you'll manage! CANCER Forget the ways in which you've been disappointed or let down. And don't try to score points off other people, for what you gain now could be more than outweighed by losses next week. It's much better to play fair and offer others only your sympathy and compassion. 
LEO, It's generally a laid-back and secretive day, but the gradual approach to a profoundly creative region of your chart could get your juices flowing. With any luck you'll soon be brimming with fresh and lively ideas. You may consider new propositions - and put old ones on hold. 
VIRGO, Practical and financial matters are set to improve, mainly because of your own hard effort and sound judgment. In this, as in other areas of your life, it's not a matter of good luck, but of a job well done. I hope other people remember to say 'thank you'! 
LIBRA, It's an ambitious day, and many of you could be concerned with professional goals. Even in your spare time the activities which please you most will be those which allow you to compete, and hold out the hope of coming first. Whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability. 
SCORPIO, Mercury, which has been responsible for so many misunderstandings, has currently eased its curious behaviour. If partners or loved ones now seem prepared to re-open discussions and renegotiate terms, lose no time in securing agreement. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is an ideal moment for grabbing bargains, or for making decisive moves in all joint finances and investments. The very fact that Mercury is emerging from a secretive position will soon restore your good judgment. But if you're not ready to speak your mind just yet, that's fine. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon's continuing emotional motion should now have made it clear that you should listen to partners, come what may. Even if they are speaking from their heart rather than their head, there is much from which you may learn. You might also find out what makes them tick, and that could transform your own behaviour. AQUARIUS It's a relatively busy day, and even romantic relationships must to be worked at. Domestic partnerships are even more in need of a little tinkering around the edges, just to make sure that others are happy and contented. If loved ones feel good then so should you. It's simple, really! 
TAURUS, You may currently be out on a limb, although it doesn't seem to matter too much. Only if money is concerned will you be obliged to make it absolutely clear to other people that you must be included. And if they have any sense they'll listen to your wise words. 
GEMINI, After a few emotional ups and downs, the focus in your chart moves on to money. It's therefore time to be more businesslike than in the past and make sure that recent mistakes are corrected. If there's someone who can give you real, practical assistance, ask sooner rather than later. Follow coronavirus pandemic LIVE updates CANCER Mars is once again insisting that you brook no interference in affairs which concern you and you alone. People who think differently will soon discover that you are a force to be reckoned with. In fact, they might regret opening their mouths in the first place! 
LEO, Decisions and discussions at home should now be completed. There may still be questions concerning children to consider, but that is another matter. Try to spend whatever time is necessary recharging your emotional batteries, ready for the next stage. 
VIRGO, You would be well-advised to stick to what has been agreed so far, at least until other people send signals that they are ready for change. You may accept social invitations that you might once have turned down, all in the cause of broadening your horizons. Follow India-China border dispute LIVE updates 
LIBRA, You must be prepared for challenges at work or criticism of your motives. Welcome such developments when they come, and realise that their purpose is to encourage you to do even better in the future. It's difficult to think of any area in which there is no room for improvement, so jump to it. 
SCORPIO, The Moon is smiling on all emotional, romantic individuals. This is precisely the sort of planetary picture which endows you with confidence in your feelings, and therefore with the ability to make the most of your charms. There could be times when you're irresistible. Read | Aarya review: The Sushmita Sen-starrer is taut and enjoyable 
SAGITTARIUS, Domestic spending moves up your daily agenda, hitting potentially expensive points at various key moments. These are therefore times to guard your wallet and use your resources with care! Plus, if you're going to take an emotional risk you'd better make sure you're not about to hurt someone who is important to you. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon's curious relationship with your sign will oblige you to take note of partners' desires. In fact it's fair to say that you'll ignore them at your peril: even if you get away with it today, they'll catch up with you tomorrow. Or the day after! Read | Polling for 19 Rajya Sabha seats in eight states today AQUARIUS You should now be beginning to feel the benefits of Venus' soothing presence in your chart, including a more balanced attitude to relationships and an ability to express your feelings with greater confidence. Discretion is one of your better qualities at the moment, by the way. 
TAURUS, What the future holds emotionally is now being signposted by Venus. This challenging pattern indicates that your hopes will rise, but you should realise that if they are to be satisfied there must be a little more input from you. That's the bottom line! 
GEMINI, Personally and professionally you now have far too much going for you to be sidetracked by the emotional fall-out from a partner's actions. You must now put the past behind you and get on with creating the future. There really is no alternative! CANCER Take refuge in your shell if you think it will do you good. When other people come knocking you may let them in, but only if they swear to respect your secrets and not to laugh at you! When your confidence is restored you will be able to turn the tables on them. Your patience will be rewarded. 
LEO, Social stars remain bright to the extent that, even at work, friendly collaboration with colleagues seems to be essential. One of your best moves will be to gather allies around you and make sure that, when the time comes, you have the support you need. That's the least that you deserve. 
VIRGO, You may push the boat out at work, and aim for the top job. Even if you don't get it you should at least draw attention to your many gifts and talents. Elsewhere, even at home, insist that you have your time under the spotlight. You never know - other people might be happy to take a back seat. 
LIBRA, This is bound to be a time of challenging situations, although something, an unseen hand if you like, will seem to be opening doors for you. Focus on legal questions, ethical matters and travel plans just for now, and tackle cash quandaries when you've got the groundwork sorted out. 
SCORPIO, Close associates may not be pleased with the way you have changed your mind, but really one would have thought they'd be pleased to see a little flexibility. Perhaps the truth will dawn on them in a few days' time! When that has happened you will be ready to make your next move. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sometimes life singles you out for special treatment. You may be thinking 'why me'? The answer is because the finger of fate is pointing at you and urging you to seize chances for self-improvement, polishing up your partnerships in the process. 
CAPRICORN, Events on the home front are bound to encourage you to make the necessary improvements. This is very much a moment for rolling up your sleeves and getting on with it, rather than expecting somebody else to step in. If you want them to make the first move you might be waiting forever! AQUARIUS Deep down, you have creative gifts which have so far remained untapped. This is one of those moments when you can do no better than take determined steps to exploit all that buried creative power. And if you need to learn a new skill first, find the best teacher you can. 
TAURUS, Business and financial choices are looming, as they seem to do about once a month! This time round though, you may be able to settle questions which date back anything up to a year, and even plan for the next twelve months. Plus, a new element enters in the form of a desire to do good. 
GEMINI, The Moon is making friends and colleagues think again. Or, at least, a guilty conscience might be stirring! It's therefore an ideal moment for considering the successes and failures of the past six to twelve months and working out how to do things better over the coming year! CANCER There is a lot to be said for closing your eyes and not taking too much notice of other people's silly gossip and rumours. One way for you to get the best out of the day is to get involved in a charitable enterprise, or just do your bit to make the world a better place. 
LEO, No one seems willing to share your burdens or even offer you much-needed moral support. This is as it should be, for Saturn is teaching you a very valuable lesson, which is to stand on your own two feet. Once you've learnt that, Jupiter will confer its rewards. Read | India-China border news LIVE UPDATES 
VIRGO, Today's ambitious Moon has a powerful professional pattern. It's one of those aspects which advises you to press ahead with all worldly ambitions, including anything which will bring recognition in your community. Does that attract you? I hope so! 
LIBRA, Although the Moon is indicating an increase in tension, on this particular occasion it is helpfully aligned to your sign. You may therefore usefully widen your vistas and plan adventurous moves. Make peace your priority, and see to it that you prosper by making friends. 
SCORPIO, No matter what other people have or have not done, you will have to stop judging them and concentrate instead on your own motives. If you have been relying on financial or business values, you should now think again, especially if a matter of the heart is involved. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon's key aspects align almost exactly with the heart of that sensitive region of your chart responsible for being of service to others. You may be able to take the initiative, but rather more likely is the prospect that partners will seize the limelight in ways you never thought possible. Live Updates | Coronavirus India LIVE Updates 
CAPRICORN, Stay busy. Today's dominant planetary aspect puts the emphasis fairly and squarely on work, and even at home you should concentrate on dealing with whatever backlog of chores has built up. It's all a matter of clearing the decks, and making space for future pleasures. AQUARIUS Your pleasure zones are being stimulated by the Moon, and the result could be frustration if you are absolutely tied to your routine, but a splendid day if you are able to break out of a rut. Of course, if you take a risk, you have to be happy with the consequences, however they result. 
TAURUS, You should still be able to make the running. The only doubts in your mind may concern your financial circumstances, and whether you can actually afford to pay for all that you would like. If you reassure yourself on this score then everything else should fall into place. 
GEMINI, You may still be making plans which are better kept to yourself, at least until they're clear in your own mind. By tomorrow you will be ready to be more open, and to lay down the law. Of course, there's no guarantee that other people will listen. So, what's new? Follow Coronavirus in India LIVE updates CANCER You have now experienced one moderately testing phase. You're about to pass through another, but it will be fairly mild and concerned only with your need to sort out your dreams - which are to be put into practice and which left on the shelf? Plus, of course you're now a little older - and much wiser. 
LEO, Venus, planet of love, is about to step up its role. The broader significance of potentially fruitful meetings and news is that you're approaching a period during which you must finally settle with all outstanding partnership issues. Hopefully the people you meet now will make you happy. 
VIRGO, Your change in mood should take you from a position which is relatively laid- back to one which is rather more ambitious. According to your natural cycle your energy level could actually increase as the hours pass. But, then, you might feel your vitality drop if you do too much too early.

LIBRA, It seems as if you are about to be called upon to make a decision which could symbolise a complete change of direction in your most intimate affairs. Everything is now bound up with the next set of lunar patterns, so don't expect perfect clarity today. 
SCORPIO, You must consider the material or financial advantages to be gained from putting your plans into practice. If you have any reason to doubt others' responses and reactions, keep your ideas to yourself for a few more days. Also, give a loved one time to digest recent news. 
SAGITTARIUS, If partners have been keeping out of your way or avoiding your gaze, everything is likely to change this evening when you realise just what your relationships mean to you. Use the day constructively to settle as many routine affairs as you possibly can. READ | Delhi reaches out to Kathmandu: Pause map process, come to table 
CAPRICORN, You have been misinformed or misled in the past, but there may be nothing that you can do about it now. Probably the only way to turn the tables on other people is to out-do them at work. But you might well decide that you really can't be bothered. That's OK too! AQUARIUS Others' attitudes and behaviour are their business, and you should let them go their own sweet way rather than trying to control them. It is increasingly clear that you should lead by setting an example, not by preaching! Eventually other people should get the message! 
TAURUS, When the Moon is as helpful as it is right now, life has to improve. It should be enough to convince you that private affairs and professional offers are generally favourable, just as long as you can cope with a few unexpected mood swings. You don't have to worry about the past - at least not today. 
GEMINI, The Moon is already sending emotional ripples through your affairs. Just for now there are probably one or two things you need to keep to yourself, so feel free to do so. Socially, you may go for entertainments which are tried and tested, ones which avoid risks and potential embarrassment. Read | Mumbai local trains to start today for essential service workers CANCER The long-term pattern of your life has now shifted, and you will be obliged to go back over old matters that you thought were dead and buried. Don't see this as a waste of time, but as a typically eccentric way of moving forward by going sideways. 
LEO, Your outlook, tactics and general approach are all capable of creating a stir, especially at work. It's a day for competition rather than co-operation, so you should feel at home. The trick is not to mind whether you fail or not, for unless you come unstuck occasionally, you'll never discover your real strengths. 
VIRGO, Use your time profitably to press on with educational matters, check up on travel plans and generally make sure that you know your rights. Broaden your horizons, and don't let others force you into a corner. In other words, put aside the habits of a lifetime! Read | In Gujarat, Rajasthan, and MP, daily cases and deaths largely constant 
LIBRA, At least you should now have the courage to press on with business plans. It looks as if family and domestic expenditure are high up the agenda, but there'll be time enough in the future for luxuries and treats. Your current priority should be to consolidate your gains. 
SCORPIO, You really do have to accept that there is no time like the present for making firm decisions. You have become used to delaying tactics, even to obstruction from those who should know better, but this is about to change. You never know - you might even receive an apology. But don't count on it! 
SAGITTARIUS, In a matter of days you will recover your ability to think straight and take the right decisions. Hopefully others will recognise that your judgment is back on top form. Just for today, you should focus on purely routine matters, if only to catch up with yourself. Read| Explainspeaking: As Unlock enters third week, a visible lack of public confidence 
CAPRICORN, Much of the visible planetary activity takes place in the regions of your chart which encourage you to take the initiative, rather than sitting back and waiting for other people. Of course, for that to happen, you have to be sure of what you want, and that's another matter entirely. AQUARIUS Romantic secrets and feelings which you've been keeping to yourself for far too long, are about to be revealed. It will therefore pay you to have your story ready rather than being caught on the hop. The last thing you want now is extra embarrassment. 
TAURUS, When we talk about change, there is one point that needs to be made — you are so deeply cautious that you often fail to recognise when conditions are evolving, even when they're moving at an alarming rate. You should be more alive to passing offers, and seize the initiative. Read| May 19-June 7, Delhi: A Covid diary 
GEMINI, It is likely that a satisfactory and agreeable conclusion to a current situation will be reached very soon. In the meantime, you may receive moral support from the realisation that your financial affairs, which have been looking complex, are about to take a dramatic turn for the better. Cancer Generous, jovial, Jupiter, no less than other ‘planets, is sent to test us, and words of advice are essential if encouraging statements are to be balanced. You must always look before you leap, otherwise everything that you have built up so patiently could be lost in one mad, reckless gesture. 
LEO, Your planets are pushing you this way and that. You must continue to try and strike the right note, keeping partners sweet and ensuring that everybody's interests are properly balanced. It may now be up to you to persuade partners that your way forward is the correct one. Meanwhile Venus ensures that everything romantic is now going your way.

VIRGO, Current planetary aspects are reassuring you that you are indeed on the right path emotionally. You must remember that there are few people who have the strength of character or integrity to live up to the high standards you tend to exact. You'll soon stumble across a financial opportunity, so keep your eyes open. 
LIBRA, Your personal affairs are about to go through a minor revolution. Just how this strange turnaround will take place is not yet clear, although friends and lovers will play a crucial role. The other point to bear in mind is that rumours and suspicions may be circulating, threatening to put you off your stroke. Ignore such distractions. 
SCORPIO, All is change. You are now in the build-up to a positive and powerful set of planetary transits next month. In the meantime, you may devote your attention to family affairs, resolving them and leaving yourself free to cope with the contradictions and conflicts which may erupt soon, perhaps towards the end of the week.

SAGITTARIUS, Your planets may be leading you towards a spiritual quest — in addition to any ordinary journeys of exploration. Day-to-day work at the moment is very much a question of carrying out routine tasks rather than making brave strides forward, so if ambitions are bubbling up, be patient. 
CAPRICORN, Friendly and collaborative stars are in the ascendant, and you will do well if you team up with the like-minded. At the end of this period, you should realise that all the emotional storms you have endured are well and a thing of the past. Expect the most dramatic scenes later in the week. AQUARIUS You need to leave your mind free for some extremely hard bargaining in a business deal, regardless of whether the sums of money involved are minute or relatively large. A number of serious planets are creating dramatic opportunities for emotional renewal, in new relationships. 
TAURUS, Moral or ethical choices should now have been taken, and you must soon tell partners what you have decided. Whether they respect or even agree with your view of what is right and what is wrong is their business. Ultimately you have to do what you know is correct. 
GEMINI, All creative individuals should have a satisfactory day, and that includes every single one of you - especially if you have a particular hobby or project to pursue. In general this is not a time for extremes, so be content with the middle way, and see to it that practical deadlines are met. CANCER The Moon's daily pattern suggests that only the best will do, especially as far as home affairs are concerned. But then there's the question of your social life, and your need to feel part of a real group of like-minded people. The pieces of a friendly jig-saw could be falling into place very soon.

LEO, A handy alignment involving Mercury and Mars is just about the perfect indication for all individuals intent on completing practical tasks and achieving tangible results. The rest of you may find that, come what may, domestic chores take the supreme position in your life. 
VIRGO, It may seem as if the root of any minor problems or crises today is financial. Money may indeed be a vital factor, but underlying everything are your emotional needs and attitudes to personal security. If you feel safe and happy in yourself then you really won't be bothered whether you lose a little cash - or win a little. 
LIBRA, You may be more determined than ever to get your point across at home, especially if you see some way of snapping up a bargain or sorting out a financial dispute. Actually, partners would be foolish if they failed to pay attention to your words of wisdom. Also read | Moderna COVID-19 vaccine appears to clear safety hurdle in mouse study 
SCORPIO, There is one thing to be said for keeping your ideas to yourself, and that is that you won't give partners a chance to criticise you! Besides, you don't want to waste too much time explaining yourself. Give them leeway to catch up and enter the modern age before you spring any surprises on them. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're now into a new cycle of prosperity which should help wipe out some of the complicated financial patterns which have been plaguing you of late. Don't expect instant results - it might be the end of next week before a burden is lifted and you are reassured. 
CAPRICORN, The most pleasing indication today concerns Venus' relationship with your sign, inaugurating a more favourable emotional phase, and probably enabling you to spill the beans and get away unscathed. You never know when you're going to get your way - but it could be soon! READ | Risk of Covid case fatality in India relatively higher among females: Study AQUARIUS Long-range affairs seem to be much more important than usual. Overseas connections are very significant, and travel trips should be arranged without delay. Get in touch with family members who are far away, check up on educational matters and resolve monetary matters this afternoon. 
TAURUS, There is much to be said for pressing ahead with every routine chore necessary for your own survival. There is also a welcome absence of difficult planetary aspects, which means that you may clear the decks of all unwanted and unfinished business - as soon as you can. 
GEMINI, Read | One month into lockdown, less than 1% exposed: ICMR survey If you can shift various chores and duties until next week, there seems to be no good reason not to do so. About the only responsibilities which do seem hard to deal with concern children and younger relations. You might even do well out of being more light-hearted yourself! CANCER Mercury now settles into a harmonious relationship with Venus, an almost perfect indication of passionate encounters and intimate, almost cosy, times with loved ones. Give the top priority to pleasure and remember that, if you enjoy yourself, so will others. 
LEO, You may expect unscheduled journeys and should anticipate that the reasons will be for business, or at least for some other serious reason, rather than for pleasure. Your general approach should be solid and sensible, so don't follow idle distractions. Don't miss from Explained | Why asymptomatic Covid-19 cases matter 
VIRGO, It looks very much as if it will be how much things cost that now determines what you can and can't get away with. It would be wrong, though, to place a cash value on personal relationships which require rather more serious consideration, but then you always knew that. 
LIBRA, The Moon is now set to gallop through your chart at a fair old pace. Interestingly enough, you can now plan for romantic success, so a partner must come to terms with the fact that you are the boss! Cash questions should clear up very soon, so don't panic. 
SCORPIO, The most perceptive amongst you will already have realised that the inevitable must happen, while the wisest individuals know that when it does it must be welcomed. One eventual outcome should be vastly increased security at home, so take the necessary steps. Read | Coronavirus global updates: US sees alarming rise 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus makes an alignment that is quite extraordinary, though very fleeting, bringing with it amazing emotional contacts with the past. You're hoping for the best and that means someone really should return from your old life, hopefully bringing fond memories. 
CAPRICORN, This should be a rather satisfactory moment for all professionally-minded people. The basic planetary disposition is favourable for most of the day, raising the possibility of friction only later this evening, but then only if you haven't set time aside to relax. AQUARIUS You're now entering a new phase during which the only promises or commitments you make should be ones you are prepared to keep. Many active and lively individuals are now bringing legal questions to completion, or at least to a more satisfactory stage. Read | Hyderabad: Doctors call off strike, give state government 15 days to implement assurances 
TAURUS, The fact that the Moon is moving very rapidly through the zodiac is a very helpful sign. Relations with children should benefit, which means that those of you who have been experiencing family difficulties may now take the necessary initiatives. 
GEMINI, A word for everyone involved in major domestic expenditure, including property deals, is that everything looks basically auspicious. Even possible differences of opinion won't break the basic helpful pattern. In fact, they'll probably help clear the air, giving you a much better perspective on old problems. CANCER Deadlines are looming! This is by no means the final decision time, but you should at least make a number of outstanding choices about what you're going to do and, more importantly, who you do it with. The question 'why' can perhaps be put off until another time! 
LEO, A certain businesslike alignment in your solar chart is set to continue, at least for another few days. One reading says that you should now go all out to get one month's work completed in one day. Another says that you should concentrate on doing the best you can, rather than getting chores finished as quickly as possible. 
VIRGO, The Moon makes a profound emotional impact on your life for the second day running, extending a generally capable and confident period, but also bringing an increasing risk of complacency with every hour that passes! The last thing you want to do is overlook the obvious! 
LIBRA, Probably the greatest risks lying in wait for you today involve plots, conspiracies and gossip. Remember that such things are indiscriminate in the damage they cause, and you should squash all rumours as soon as they arise. It's much better to stick to the truth. 
SCORPIO, Teamwork is now essential, which, of course, could mean spending all day sitting in meetings! At home, you should do your best to delegate chores to any passing friend or relative, spreading the burden as widely as you can. It's about time they did their fair share! 
SAGITTARIUS, There is so much going on in the planetary spheres, not in your sign, but in your neighbouring signs, that life must be increasingly complex. Your daily possibilities will be multiplying, so don't expect everything to be clear - at least, not just yet. 
CAPRICORN, You're now entering a new financial phase which will probably last for about four weeks. This is not likely to be easy, but then neither will it be difficult. Even small developments, though, could be significant, and hence worthy of your maximum attention. AQUARIUS One rather important question concerns the value you put on close relationships, and the emotional demands you therefore feel able to make on other people. Financial goals should be kept in perspective, for you should judge people by their human qualities, not by their wealth. 
TAURUS, It is a strange fact that the movement of one set of planetary patterns into an enjoyable sector of your chart will free you to get on with important professional matters. This is a time for ambition, not humility, for aiming for the top, not for accepting second-best. 
GEMINI, You may remember the past very clearly, and you might imagine that the lessons you have learnt are still with you. This is true, partially at least, but a little personal honesty would help you accept advice from others. You know that can't be a bad thing! CANCER A vague romantic aura will affect all twelve signs, but is perhaps strongest in your chart, so do feel free to take a completely imaginative course, irrespective of whether others accuse you of being out of touch with 'reality'. They're probably just missing the point! Follow Coronavirus India LIVE updates 
LEO, You may swing into action in financial matters, even if it's no more than a case of overdue shopping trips. Helpful personal trends are given a mighty push by the fact that you are prepared to help yourself, rather than wait for fate to deal you a good hand. 
VIRGO, You can afford to be somewhat more self-confident today. The point is that if you're smart you'll be able to outwit others in both the creative and organisational stakes, which means you could just about have things wrapped up before long. While you're doing that, spare a little time for making your home more colourful. 
LIBRA, You're certainly full of good ideas at the moment, and the rather interesting point about today's stars is the push they give you towards finding schemes that will benefit others. You should be very careful about any temptation to go behind someone's back. Read | Signs of de-escalation: China, India pull back troops from key LAC points 
SCORPIO, It is time to put a little extra thought into organising your social life; otherwise events will move on, leaving you stranded. You may go for options which are enthusiastic, optimistic and which stretch you, introducing you to new experiences. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a rather productive day for all professional types, even if the most helpful stars do occur this evening, thus favouring night-owls and shift-workers! In financial matters, you had better watch out for smooth-talking sales people bearing false promises. 
CAPRICORN, You're in for a period of helpful planetary aspects, ones which should set you up for a rather pleasant time. Socially you should do something a little extraordinary and get out of a rut in however small a way. You might actually find that you enjoy activities you'd always ignored. Read | To fact-check posts on social media, I&amp;B PSU floats a tender AQUARIUS Pay more attention to business matters. A joint financial arrangement looks very prosperous, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't step in and see that other people are doing their bit. You might also encourage rivals to be more pleasant to each other in future! 
TAURUS, If you are itching to get on with a vital professional goal, you might have to hold yourself back for now. At the very least, you should attend to fundamental matters which you may have overlooked, but without which no venture will succeed. Extra attention to detail will pay dividends. 
GEMINI, Behind superficial cash and financial issues lies a deeper question, which is the value you attach to close partners. There is no need for guilt, but do be sure not to take someone for granted again. And don't judge friends according to how much they earn. CANCER It's a fine period for romantic gifts and presents, mainly because of a close confluence between the sectors of your chart ruling money and inspiration. Any purchase which brings you closer to a nostalgic experience is strikingly appropriate, and it could be fun to relive your past. 
LEO, Partners will gradually begin to make their presence felt. The cycle which now picks up speed is all about personal security, and you'll soon be looking for permanent relationships, not fleeting encounters. Stability is the key to contentment, even if it doesn't always seem that way. 
VIRGO, You may give yourself at least a day to mull over certain important issues, and don't feel that you have to come clean if you don't want to. By now, many of you are feeling that you've had enough of being a doormat for others to walk on. Stand up for yourself! 
LIBRA, You're certainly in a mood for change at home, and I doubt if you'll put up with fools. There's one snag - your ideas may be amazing, but might also be just a mite impractical. You may have to go back to square one if you are to achieve anything of lasting value. 
SCORPIO, Whatever you think or say today will surely have a touch of poetry about it. This is perfect for all artists or lovers, but perhaps not so ideal for those who are facing an unavoidable practical routine. The best advice is probably to take important matters at your own pace - and not allow yourself to be rushed. 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus is now drifting towards the end of its current romantic phase, so you have but a few days left to maximise your advantage in an emotional situation. Actually, you should get on the phone, or otherwise find a way to issue invitations, before mid-afternoon. 
CAPRICORN, You have one or two emotional secrets to be sure, but everyone has a right to their privacy. Do remember, though, that before very much longer, partners will be determined to find out exactly what has been going on. You'd better have a convincing story ready! AQUARIUS You have no choice but to listen to other people, otherwise you may throw away what you have so painfully gained. Agreement, by the way, will probably be very much easier to reach if you take the trouble to explain yourself properly, rather than expecting others to agree with your every word. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You may be gripped on the horns of a dilemma, unsure whether personal or public affairs must take precedence. The fact is that family obligations should have first call on your attention. A younger relation might come up with just the advice that you need. 
GEMINI, Gemini: It's a day for communication, for exchanging opinions and perhaps discovering exactly what else is going on. Do consider the virtues of making a complete break with the past in a financial matter. It's not necessarily people that you need to wave farewell to, but your own bad habits! CANCER Cancer: There's no time to flap around, so make a businesslike start to the week. Partners are liable to be in an erratic mood yet again, but perhaps you'll be able to ignore some of their more silly ideas and see if there is anything in what they say which could be of use. 
LEO, Leo: You seem to have a fair measure of control today, perhaps because others will voluntarily surrender some of their power. However, any such advantage will be purely temporary, so you will squander good fortune at your own risk. A little caution could pay off. 
VIRGO, Virgo: There's a sense in which secrecy is called for, perhaps more than anything else, so if other people insist that they have an automatic right to know what you're doing, you should give them short shrift. The simple way out of a deadlock is to look for similarities between your feelings and other people's, rather than differences. 
LIBRA, Libra: There is much to be said for pressing ahead with social goals and activities, so that you may have little time for work. If professional chores are utterly unavoidable, the way to cheer yourself up is teamwork - meetings and the like, or even a party! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It just so happens that one of the strongest regions of your chart at the moment is that which feeds your ideas, and anyone who ignores your proposals, suggestions and invitations will do so at their peril. Mind you, I am quite sure that they will come round in the end. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Today's stars are sent to test your mettle and to see if you are prepared to put your adventurous dreams into practice. If you can tackle joint ambitions and get other people to back you, then you might build up the experience necessary to pursue your own vision of the future. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The Sun's delicate movement will soon draw a significant personal phase to a close. However, there is still a great deal more thought to be put in before you get into the swing of a new relationship. You may also have to make a concession or two to keep a loved one happy. AQUARIUS Aquarius: There's a new theme developing in your chart this week, one which seems to be very much connected to a lingering quest for security. The most important question is whether you can provide sufficient stability for yourself, or whether you will have to rely on other people. 
TAURUS, You are supposed to be born under the materialistic sign, and now is your chance to prove it. A tight group of planets, moving through your monetary house, will call you to demonstrate that recent indications of revised prosperity are more than just a flash in the pan.

GEMINI, After a period in which rather dull matters, like money, have tended to dominate your attention, Venus, goddess of love and desire, takes up a powerful aspect. Don't expect dramatic changes right away. What you can do, though, is begin to schedule a profitable future. Cancer Yours is one of the famous double signs of the zodiac, which means that you have two natures. On the one hand you are thrusting and ambitious, on the other retiring and sensitive. Right now, Mars is commanding you to slip into your aggressive mode. Yet, you always have to work out exactly how far partners can be pushed.

LEO, It's very much a week of decisions and choices. You are likely to be drawn into confusion on the work front and serious disputes at home. However, there is no inevitability about this. While the planets' natural tendency is to draw you into confrontations, these will only take place if you fail to heed the warning signs. 
VIRGO, It's a week of two halves, one when you can focus on family, the other for work. This is likely to be one of those maddening periods when colleagues seem completely undecided as to what they want from you. But there's no point in sounding off about other people letting you down. 
LIBRA, The answers are on the way, but not just yet. You are still deeply concerned over what is becoming a seemingly endless round of domestic changes, yet you will soon find that certain problems disappear. In fact, a number of planets line up in your support, including Jupiter and Venus, the ancient heralds of good fortune. Watch | Aerial footage shows thousands gathered to protest against George Floyd's killing in Philadelphia 
SCORPIO, You are probably tired of hearing how Jupiter's helpful movements are supposed to be bringing you good fortune. However, you should understand that periods of advancement and expansion carry with them their own brand of care as you struggle to cope with changes which may not be of your own choosing. 
SAGITTARIUS, That marvellous planet Jupiter is still stirring up your desires and ideas, which means that, although the scales are still tipped against you, they won't be like this for too much longer. Right now, a great deal depends on how you respond to adverse circumstances, for there is nothing which may not be turned to your advantage. 
CAPRICORN, This week represents a valuable and not-to-be-missed chance for you to make a fresh start. Remember that you cannot afford to be headstrong or hasty when dealing with other people. The minute you forget that partners have feelings of their own will be the moment that you come unstuck. AQUARIUS Life shows signs of settling down. You may only now be recovering from the high pressure storms of the last few months, and the implications of events that took place then may still not have fully sunk in. This should be a week to savour, for planetary pressures are balanced by helpful influences. 
TAURUS, Your stars are perfect for a spot of pleasure. It really doesn't matter whether your interests are high-brow or low, whether it's the disco that beckons or the opera. Just allow yourself to unwind, pursue new interests and explore the world around you. 
GEMINI, Don't take too much for granted and do try to see people and situations as they really are. Remember that old saying: the good general never fights a battle she, or he, is not going to win. That way you'll avoid blundering into problems which are actually easily avoided. CANCER You should get out and about today, satisfying your natural curiosity. Don't take your preconceptions with you, but understand that everyone has a story to tell. Also, seek out the people who can give you the expert advice and practical help you need. READ | Border meeting over Ladakh tensions: Delhi, Beijing work the lines, commanders to hold LAC talks today 
LEO, Jupiter enables you to take the initiative. The question, though, is what issues to deal with now? I'd say that shopping, spending and savings have a fair claim on your time, if not the best. But then, there's also the emotional cost of a relationship to consider. 
VIRGO, Career or personal problems have to be faced, but you can allow yourself some time off. Given that a number of long-term questions can now be deferred, today looks like a good time to potter around, busying yourself with chores and home improvements. 
LIBRA, The only things that will stop you are your own doubts. You would be well advised to wait until this evening, tomorrow or even next month if you are initiating a new project. If you push ahead too early, then you might forget some very essential preparations. READ | Transmission slowest ever, Maharashtra load big factor now and later 
SCORPIO, You may decide to throw in your lot with a person, or persons, who operate in a different circle. You might do best to start by making your needs quite clear, and leaving nobody in any doubt that you mean business. But they probably already know that, anyway! 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon's tricky relationship with your sign may set you on edge but, if you give in to your emotions, you may feel a whole lot better. You should already have a date in your mind for your next major engagement, so get on and make the necessary arrangements. READ | Choked review: Not enough bite 
CAPRICORN, This is very much a time to capitalise on your unique potential, not to mention your under-used artistic talents. Please try and find whatever romantic avenue is going to suit you best. The point is that if you're happy, people close to you will feel better. AQUARIUS You've been through the mill, but difficulties over intensely personal matrimonial or partnership matters should now be in the past. You're now in a healing phase, during which all rifts must be mended. If you allow difficult emotions to linger then they might get worse again next month, or the month after that. READ | 112 in a month: Why Covid death rate in Jalgaon is four times India's 
TAURUS, The past few months have sometimes been mentally as well as physically exhausting. The Sun is now moving close enough to an intriguing relationship with Pluto to remind you that, in order to achieve your goals, you must spend as much time as you need on rest and recuperation. 
GEMINI, You really do seem to have the whip-hand, but I suspect that you are only now at the very beginning of a phase when you will discover your true strength. Do not throw your weight around prematurely. But, then, I am sure I don't have to remind you that subtlety is the best policy. CANCER There's still a very strong chance that something is going to happen to make you feel hurt or undermined. However, there is no reason why you should read anything which is unintended into chance remarks. If you're not sure what a partner means, then say so! 
LEO, People who have let you down may not deserve good treatment, but neither should you rush to take revenge. After all, first you have to ascertain that their motives were bad. Otherwise you should just accept that mistakes were made. Do not allow financial considerations to sway your actions. READ | If LAC not marked soon, build-up like on LoC likely: Ex-Army chief 
VIRGO, The planets will add a dash of emotion to your sign today, compelling you to face up to long-forgotten feelings. On a completely mundane level, you should exert your power at home and brook no opposition. But whether that strategy works or not will depend on your sense of timing. 
LIBRA, Mars is now making its aggressive presence felt over a part of your chart concerned with ethics, morals and legal questions. You may therefore wish to make your views known over the coming week or so, but I'd advise you now not to bend the rules - at least, not too far. 
SCORPIO, You are having a reminder of what happened three months' ago and a taste of what is likely to take place in about three months' time. Don't fall into the trap of imagining that this is your last chance, regardless of whether your concern is private or professional. READ | Unlockdown SOPs: 50% seats in restaurants, food courts in malls 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon's emotional passage through your solar chart can be confused, and your precise intentions are not always easy to pin down. You may be critical of low standards, which is fine, but also much too fussy, which is not. Be tolerant of other people's little foibles. 
CAPRICORN, Before you explore new possibilities, do investigate the ethical alternatives. It might be that there's a better way to do things. Also, check up to see if an overseas contact or a foreign friend has something to offer. If it's advice you're after, women may be a better bet than men. AQUARIUS You appear to be more concerned about your short-term happiness than about others' feelings but, quite honestly, it is high time that certain people stopped relying on you. Get your priorities straight as soon as you can, and then at least partners will be able to decide whether to support you or not. READ | 20% of India's cases in Mumbai but daily tests frozen at 4,000 all of May 
TAURUS, You may still be in the thick of things, but gradually the dust will begin to settle. One way or another, home affairs must use up more time. If it's not a matter of breakages and repairs, then it will be relatives' emotional demands which play on your nerves. 
GEMINI, Remember that magnetic Mars is your firm ally, but beware of over-confidence. You must therefore be tremendously assertive, but not at all aggressive. You should be attentive to other people and listen carefully to their wishes, otherwise your reputation will suffer. CANCER There's almost no perceptible change in your stars since yesterday, which means that money matters are still way up the agenda. Psychologically, though, the main issue seems to be the extent to which you lack self-esteem. Try to believe in yourself more than in the past. 
LEO, Jupiter and the Moon make a pretty emotional pair and, although the general trend is towards good fortune, I am concerned that you may misjudge the situation. Never mistake license for liberty, and never imagine that you can do whatever you want just because nobody says you can't! 
VIRGO, Secrecy may be essential, and I don't think you should feel badly about keeping something to yourself. However, feelings such as resentment, jealousy and suspicion should have no place in your emotional repertoire. After all, if you feel badly towards someone, they might feel the same to you! 
LIBRA, You must be prepared for your mood to change by this evening as the earth spins and the Sun moves. If lunar alignments have their way, you may soon begin to feel quieter and more solitary. Socially, you may therefore veer towards intimate encounters away from larger gatherings. 
SCORPIO, There are so many snares and pitfalls at the moment that it is difficult to know what to do next. However, you may decide what is really urgent and tackle less important issues when you have more time available. That means that other people may have to wait for you - for a change. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you are unable to express your feelings over the next two months, the truth might still be dragged out of you! You may therefore like to think now about how and when you must tell others what has been going on. You must prepare your story with care. 
CAPRICORN, You should get all financial affairs settled today, regardless of whether you're shifting currency around the globe or picking up a bargain at the corner shop. By the time evening comes, you may begin to feel more relaxed and at ease with yourself - if all goes according to plan. AQUARIUS The recent confrontation between the Sun and the Moon represented a battle between two sharply opposing psychological pressures. Hopefully, a few personal illusions have now been overcome and you can get on with the future, much wiser - and perhaps a little more mature! 
TAURUS, I have spoken before about the potential for substantial improvements in your home, personal and family affairs. Today's stars bring a major shift forward, and you may soon be set free from a pressing responsibility. And that just has to be welcome news! 
GEMINI, Keep an eye out for mistaken instructions and lost directions. Interviews and discussions could be muddled, short journeys could lead to unexpected destinations. Tread carefully around all legal delicacies and make sure that you explain yourself properly. Then everything will work out just fine. CANCER Today's the day to sow fertile seeds for future prosperity. If you don't find any loose change in the street, at least you can gear your investments up for a future breakthrough. Don't put all your eggs in the same basket, though, or you risk losing everything. 
LEO, It's been a few years since we saw planetary alignments like the ones that are building up now. You may be buffeted by celestial storms, but that's all the more reason you need to wrap up well, metaphorically speaking, before you go out. The more protected you are, the better. 
VIRGO, Only the highest standards will do, and I must ask you to be a saint. The stars are threatening to undermine your confidence, but if you are sincere, loving, dutiful and self-sacrificing, you will dodge all negative planetary patterns, attract respect and enhance your reputation. 
LIBRA, You have your share of responsibility but, if you wish, you may make personal pleasure and creative satisfaction your principle priority. It's all a matter of seeing that partners take responsibility for themselves, and don't expect you to wait on them hand and foot. 
SCORPIO, You may switch into top gear at work and keep your eye on the road ahead. Watch out for cul-de-sacs and blind alleys, otherwise you'll waste a great deal of time and squander your energy. Keep out of the way if partners are in a china-smashing mood. 
SAGITTARIUS, Overseas and long-distance influences are growing stronger. This is obviously significant if you're travelling, for you may meet much more than you've bargained for. And if you're at home, there must still be some way to bring an adventurous angle into your life. 
CAPRICORN, Material security does seem to be a crucial issue, although perhaps not as much as it will be after another two months have passed. It all boils down to the need to increase your cash-flow, but also to be certain that you make the best possible use of your assets. AQUARIUS It's a day of extremes and it's difficult to see whether you will achieve a major romantic breakthrough or run headlong into an emotional conflict. You must pick and choose your companions with great care, and don't let anyone else make up your mind for you. 
TAURUS, Looking ahead over the next few weeks it is clear that your costs are about to rise. Agreed, you may have one or two accounts to settle, but the dominant message points towards indulgence and luxury. But, then, life must be about pleasure as much as pain! 
GEMINI, You're entering a professional phase during which personal contacts will be increasingly important. Over the next few days, misunderstandings could mar your relationships, so do make an effort to see that everything is crystal clear, even to people who usually misunderstand the simplest things. CANCER It's 'all change' in the heavens, with good news and bad over the next eight weeks. On the one hand you'll be attracted towards an increasingly mystical perspective; on the other, you may be vulnerable to vague doubts and suspicions. Try to focus on the facts. Read | One in three small businesses close to winding up, says survey 
LEO, You will soon begin to see dramatic shifts in the planetary alignment, and you may be gripped by a mood of increasing anticipation, perhaps of irritation, possibly of hope. There will undoubtedly be moments when a little self-control will be vital. 
VIRGO, The general situation is quite busy, but you're going to have to be on the ball if you want to avoid being ripped-off or walked on. It's all a matter of knowing when to say ‘yes', and when to say ‘no'. Of course, that's much easier advice to give than to follow! 
LIBRA, The general celestial emphasis is now moving away from those old family issues, so do move to resolve all unanswered mysteries or unresolved complications. You should make sure that relatives appreciate your finer qualities, even though you might be unwilling to compromise.

SCORPIO, Good communication is still of the essence. It looks as if one plan may run into a spot of opposition, but that if you marshal all your facts you may pluck success from the jaws of disaster. Sometimes, though, it's not that easy to find the right words. That shouldn't stop you trying! 
SAGITTARIUS, Like everybody else you are going through a few changes. However, in your case money seems to be the crucial factor. The good news now is that you may at last make firm arrangements for future security - and take precautions in case of emotional eruptions. 
CAPRICORN, The celestial emphasis swings towards thoughts of future prosperity. You may play your cards right and secure all available options, ensuring that you can then make your choices in your own time. Also, feel free to share your real feelings with loved ones.

Emotional risks are as likely as financial ones, which means that romantic riches may be your reward even if a cash bonus does elude you. Close partners may be in a jumpy mood, by the way, so do your best not to provoke. 
TAURUS, The burning question is whether you should concede defeat over a moral issue. I think not, for your authoritarian approach matches the mood of the times better than anyone else's somewhat flabby principles. Mind you, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't listen to other people's wishes. Read| Unlock 1: States set to open, with caution 
GEMINI, You should wait a little longer before signing on the dotted line, especially if money is an issue. Besides, promises made now may have to be amended before long. Something that appears to guarantee your security may in fact have slight disadvantages, so don't take anything at face value. CANCER Your bargaining power couldn't be stronger but, as luck would have it, the opposition is almost insuperable. You had better be as businesslike as possible and accept that half a loaf is better than none. But, then, you are well-versed in the arts of compromise. 
LEO, Although in reality you are extremely fortunate, you seem to forget your many blessings. I know you've been carrying the world on your shoulders, but a quiet word here or there could remove one particular burden at a stroke. Just remember that someone, somewhere, loves you. Read| Lockdown all but lifted, it's up to individuals and companies now 
VIRGO, To be perfectly blunt, you were born under the sign of the worrier. Today the Moon occupies a part of your horoscope which encourages you to see the worst or look for problems. The result? You're likely to face up to fresh difficulties. The remedy? Lighten up a little! 
LIBRA, You may consider it best to distance yourself from professional or worldly affairs for a while and devote all your time and energy to making a go of social contacts, or of interests which concern nobody but you. And when you're refreshed and revived then you'll be able to play your full part in solving other people's problems. 
SCORPIO, You know better than anyone how difficult it is to distinguish fact from fantasy, yet you now have a chance to face up to the stark truth as never before. It's all a matter of realising that you may have been mistaken all along. Not only that - but a rival might have been right!

SAGITTARIUS, Restriction is always followed by expansion. This is a basic law of astrology. So if you feel a little hemmed in today, do your best to be responsible and wait another few days before you let rip. There's no hurry, so prepare your ground with care. 
CAPRICORN, Difficult patterns involving planets like Venus, Jupiter and Mars may be seen as favourable rather then problematic. You may therefore be able to turn the tables on other people, and transform a block on your progress into a guarantee of your material security. AQUARIUS Now that the Sun is your servant rather than your master, you may feel free to make your own future. In some senses your situation reminds me of the prisoner who, on being set free, asked 'what do I do now?' That's a question you'll answer as the coming days and weeks pass. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Creative Taureans should soon be on top of the world, as are any Bulls who are bursting with ambition, anxious to show what they're made of. You could be in for a high-spending week, though, with Monday your most extravagant day. That's because you have dreams to fulfil — and some of them need to be paid for. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mercury, your planetary ruler, is forming dramatic relationships. I tell you this just to show you that you've got a lot of planets on your side. This has two results. First, your ideas and opinions will be stronger than ever. Secondly, your own financial judgment might suffer: please be cautious. Cancer Cancer: You'll be reclaiming bad debts, taking broken gadgets back to the shops, resolving problems with your bank and trying to get finances on a firm footing. Happily, a partner will prove surprisingly helpful. But just who can offer the most assistance is something you might not be able to predict. 
LEO, Leo: The road ahead has many twists and turns; two steps forward, three steps back. That is the pattern of your life this week. The advice is to grin and bear it and take this unique opportunity to clear up chores which have been bugging you since last year. A bank manager, or other financial associate, must be given correct instructions. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You may expect a busy start to the week, with hectic times on Monday and Tuesday. Do yourself a favour and get into the fitness business, cleaning up your diet and taking a stroll down to the gym — or at least around the block. When it comes to other people, even a close relationship could be an uphill struggle. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your friends, lovers and acquaintances have one thing in common; they seem unable to make up their minds or even turn up on time. Your happiest moments will feature good conversation, and hopefully an unexpected trip. At work, you may use your intuition; it's partly a question of applying commonsense. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Everything depends on how you respond to the last month's worth of offers and invitations. You really don't want to turn down anyone without giving them a fair hearing. After all, you don't know what you'll be missing! You must, as a matter of principle, treat all financial transactions with suspicion until the weekend. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Mercury's awkward aspects are a sure sign of a merry old muddle. Mind you, that doesn't mean that you're not about to come up with some pretty amazing conclusions. As the relevant issues at home are so complicated, you should refuse to commit yourself, at least until you have all the information. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Your quite understandable self-interest should be tempered by the highest of motives, and partners will give you all credit due to you for that. You'll do your level best to see that what is good for you is good for everyone. Business fortunes could improve within about four weeks. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Things are not always what they seem. It may look as if other people are being inconsiderate, ducking out of engagements or just not turning up. But, look at it like this: every cancellation gives you the chance to change your plans, so they suit you. 
TAURUS, Strangely enough, a great many of you will be putting in some overtime today. If work is not your scene, you have a valuable opportunity to go all out for total and complete success in a special life-long personal ambition. If you're forced to choose between two options, then follow your heart! 
GEMINI,le As luck would have it, this could be a splendid day to sort out all holiday, leisure or travel plans, partly because something seems to have been overlooked. There is a high chance of diversions, delays and distractions along the way, so enjoy them! CANCER Shopping expeditions are favoured, but only if you are prepared to spend whatever is necessary, perhaps more than you bargained for. Never has there been a time when it was more important to receive the right guarantees, and give someone else the reassurance they deserve. 
LEO, Your stars are still helping you along a positive path. In one sense they will soon be even more utterly incredible and wonderful, but as fate would have it this also means that you could have even more dropped on your plate. You will have to be super-efficient if you are to cope. 
VIRGO, Stay busy and keep active is the message. If you sit around and do nothing, you will only encourage strange fears and unrealistic hopes. The important consideration is what has really happened, not what might have been if only things had been different. 
LIBRA, At last the stars are positioned in favour of leisure and pleasure, although your way of letting your hair down seems to be different from other people's. Your favoured entertainments could be somewhat formal and traditional, though by no means lacking in excitement! 
SCORPIO, Pressures at home seem to be building up, which is a very good thing. Years of frustration may soon be dealt with at one go, but do realise that practical issues must come first. There is still some way to go before you can turn the tables on a rival, by the way. 
SAGITTARIUS, The general planetary disposition can still be exceptionally stressful, but its particular relationship to your sign is lively and controversial. Make a point of taking interesting trips and engaging in stimulating discussions, raising explosive issues. 
CAPRICORN, Your financial stars are strong, which means that even something as simple as a shopping trip can relieve the emotional tension. You are currently passing through a potentially extravagant phase, and the best purchases are completely outrageous. AQUARIUS With lunar alignments working solidly on your side you are in a strong position, but you should watch out for over-confidence. It is difficult to know where to draw the line, but you may try to temper excess with caution, however impossible that seems! 
TAURUS, Your position is still strong, so I have every confidence that a current challenge is about to be overcome. At the very least you will acquire respect and put yourself on a better footing to succeed next time round. The longer you wait, the better your position should become - in theory! 
GEMINI, The emphasis still falls on monetary affairs, but the psychological picture shows the deeper situation. In particular, anything that happens now will be deeply tied in to your view of your own spiritual worth. You need to know that partners value you for your real, underlying qualities. CANCER You may be a little surprised by what someone has said or done, and a good thing too. It is always useful to be rminded that you can't take other people for granted, just as they need to understand how much they rely on your sound emotional sustenance. 
LEO, This looks like a busy day, although it will be very annoying indeed if all your efforts are directed into compensating for someone else's mistakes or inefficiency. You may just have to shrug your shoulders and get on with it, but keep an eye open for short-cuts. 
VIRGO, Quite aside from the fact that any younger people in your care still seem to be rather demanding, this is a fine time to enjoy yourself. The emphasis is on the arts as well as simple pleasures, so take your pick. Activities which elevate your spirit will be desirable. 
LIBRA, Changes at home or in the family seem to be of far greater long-term significance than those at work. However, it is very difficult to establish exactly where your priorities truly lie in terms of the available resources. Give it time. In fact, give it all the time you need. 
SCORPIO, A discussion may have created more confusion than it resolved. However, you still have twenty-four hours to get to the nub of the matter, and your first step might be to check up on whether you were right - or wrong! And if you see that you made a mistake, you'll gain credit by making a speedy confession. 
SAGITTARIUS, Control over domestic spending may have been taken out of your hands by events beyond your control. However, there still seems to be an excellent chance of rational dialogue with people who know best - like bank managers. In matters of the heart, you'll be most attracted to people from backgrounds and places very different from yours. 
CAPRICORN, You may have stamped too hard on someone else's aspirations. If this is indeed the case try re-running the script, this time offering them all the help and encouragement they need. Leave financial complications until tomorrow, and postpone an emotional demand until everyone is good and ready. AQUARIUS You still don't know what's going on, at least not in the real world. Where you score over the rest of us is in matters of the spirit, and anyone who has any sense will turn to you to answer those ultimate questions - like who am I? and why am I here? Oh, and don't have qualms about accepting a loved one's generosity. 
TAURUS, Travel schemes are in danger of going wrong, but apply a little forethought no and you could save yourself a big disappointment. Venus' encouraging position indicates the need for a splash of colour at home, and perhaps a party or family gathering is on the cards. 
GEMINI, Businesslike types will thrive under today's strident Sun-Moon angle. However, hope you appreciate a challenge, because there is almost no indication that life will be easy and straightforward! The trouble is that nobody is saying exactly what they mean, least of all you! CANCER Whether you or someone else should take the lead is a moot point. Perhaps you each have your own area of expertise, and the correct solution could be sensible division of labour. Play it by ear, and wait until all the facts have fallen into place. 
LEO, You may know by now that all was not what it seemed. There is no reason why you should become disillusioned or cynical, but you ought to weigh up the option very carefully and attempt to come to a realistic solution. It's difficult, know, but you need to take other people's feelings into account as well . 
VIRGO, Children, or any younger person in your care, could be increasingly demanding You won't get anywhere by trying to keep the lid on as there is a great deal o surplus energy, some of it emotional, to be released. Offer constructive support instead. 
LIBRA, If you experience a sense of deja vu, all well and good. The planets are indeed leading you back to a situation you thought had been dealt with, perhaps eighteen months ago. At least this time around, you won't repeat the same mistakes, and that has to be a good thing. 
SCORPIO, The best thing you can do now is engage in serious discussions. Practica arrangements need to be made, and they're not going to happen by themselves Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions - they're not as silly as you think. And the answers might be pleasantly surprising. 
SAGITTARIUS, If your own finances are in a mess it may be because you're too idealistic b half. You would do very well to listen to other people who, guided by those sagacious planets, the Sun and Mercury, can offer you some extremely sound advice. Mind you, you don't have to take it. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon is on your side, so nobody and nothing must prevent you from clinching a deal while the tide is running so strongly in your favour. But keep space for future changes and adaptations. The golden rule is that partners must be kept fully informed and up to date. AQUARIUS Something is happening behind the scenes which may be frankly disturbing. If I told you to separate fact from fantasy it might not do much good at a time when your imagination is so strong. Perhaps you should make a point of relying on the facts, just for a change. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You may have good reason to question other people's priorities, especially if you feel their ethical stance leaves something to be desired. You may also get in touch with family members who are far away, or engineer a reunion between friends who may have fallen out.

GEMINI, Gemini: This is an extremely useful moment to sort out all financial plans, although I hope you don't slip back into the confusion of the past. You have about three days in which you may take very valuable steps to boost your material security, after which you'll have a fresh chance in another month. CANCER Cancer: On the psychological level everything hinges around how much you value yourself, and where you see your true worth. Sort this out and you'll get rid of several bad habits which have been distorting your ability to deal with money reasonably and rationally.

LEO, Leo: The overall emphasis remains highly pleasurable, but that's probably because you can enjoy activities and experiences which leave lesser people feeling worn out and weary. Unlike many people, you have a higher regard for the virtues of hard work. Keep yourself busy. 
VIRGO, Virgo: If you settle outstanding issues at home once and for all, you should then find that more pleasurable possibilities are opened up. A cultural outing seems appropriate, but any activity which broadens your horizons and adds to the sum total of human happiness will be worthwhile.

LIBRA, Libra: It's important that you open a dialogue. If you have an interview to attend or must put over your point of view in any other way, the planets are on your side. Just don't let differences over money cloud the real issues. And do listen to friends who know you better than you know yourself. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: For once in your life it is very hopeful that your professional achievements and worldly ambitions will be properly rewarded. This is no more than you deserve, and many of you have waited an extremely long time. If there is a further delay, don't despair, but keep your hopes up. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You still have the power to control and influence everything that happens at home, so don't squander this valuable opportunity. Other people are very much of one mind, and so you'll need to have your wits about you, finding a way forward which fulfils everybody's wishes. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You may be in a haze today, but no matter. By this evening you should once again have your finger on the pulse, and nobody will be able to pull the wool over your eyes again, at least not for another week! Make a point of talking to people whose opinions are usually ignored. AQUARIUS Aquarius: This could be a sociable day, one when you may easily make the most of friendly advances. There are further indications that you'll need to spend some time alone. Some of you will even shut yourselves away, tending your sensitive emotions and oh-so-vulnerable feelings! 
TAURUS, You are not alone in experiencing powerful financial patterns, but your situation is much easier than some other people's. As far as you are concerned it is all just a matter of completing the job in hand - and of making the right decisions. Mind you, that's easier said than done! 
GEMINI, Allow other people more leeway and give them plenty of space to make their own choices. In point of fact, you may be obliged to come second-best, which could be useful because it will expose you to less risk. You may come first when the time is right, and after you have made the necessary preparations. CANCER Astrologers say that you have an excellent memory, and now is your chance to prove it. Someone will make a mistake based on their misunderstanding of the past, and you should be on hand to correct all errors and offer your usual impeccable advice. Old friends provide the best support - as you probably know! 
LEO, You must choose between facing up to an extremely awkward domestic or family situation and putting all such considerations behind you in the continuing quest for endless pleasure. There must be a middle way, but it may be another few months before you work out what it is. 
VIRGO, You can be remarkably secretive when the mood takes you. One thing other people must not know is what you are really doing! But neither should you let them become unduly suspicious. As usual, everything you achieve will be directed towards the common good. 
LIBRA, When other people misunderstand you, they normally do so in a big way. Right now, their mistake may be to imagine that you are much more confident socially than you really are. Disabuse them of this notion now, and admit to yourself that you really could do with some help! 
SCORPIO, If you are going for any sort of professional advancement or promotion, success beyond your wildest dreams is within your grasp, but only if you're patient. You must prepare your ground with care and trust that, whatever the outcome, the future is on your side. 
SAGITTARIUS, There are people who have not been pulling their weight, and this is why you are now doing more than your fair share. It may be time to don your preacher's garb and offer such types fair advice on fulfilling their responsibilities. Don't be too pompous, though. 
CAPRICORN, A number of financial cycles are now reaching a turning point, so this will not be an easy time. My advice now is to cash in your winnings so far, and only gamble with funds that you can afford to lose. And don't gamble with someone's feelings either, or you'll risk a major regret. AQUARIUS Some people may be all smiles one minute, in floods of tears the next, behaviour which will probably extend over the whole of the next week. In some cases, there will be little you can do beyond offering gentle reassurance. Besides, it's good for people to get things off their chest. 
TAURUS, Read | Domestic flights begin today To talk in terms of figures, there is a ten-percent chance of a move of home, but a ninety-percent chance of some positive domestic upheaval of equivalent magnitude. In the meantime, today's stars have a distinctly prosperous gloss, so keep your eye open for profitable possibilities. 
GEMINI, Careful judgment is required in all financial matters, but happily that seems to be just exactly what you'll have. There is much to be said for sharing your feelings with anyone who will listen, by the way, but you may have to pick your words with care. Read | Last 10 days, positivity curve begins to steepen CANCER Commonsense a plenty should be the result of Mercury's helpful location in your solar chart. Hopefully this will help you avoid a number of hidden personal pitfalls, and enable you to give other people the benefit of your advice. Will they listen? I hope so! 
LEO, Your planetary positions remain nine-tenths perfect. That remaining one tenth, though, does represent the potential for a very silly emotional confrontation which could cost you dear. I advise great caution now and over the coming weeks. After all, you don't want to offend anyone who has been good to you. Don't miss from Explained | Why risk of virus transmission in an aircraft is seen as low? 
VIRGO, So much now seems to be going on behind the scenes that you may wonder what it's all for. If only you could get away for a while, you would see that the current situation is really rather different from what you imagine. Still, perhaps it's good for you to receive a surprise. 
LIBRA, It really does look time for a short trip, or two. Someone is waiting to hear from you, so do get in touch and don't waste any more time. Workwise there is much to be said for taking an early break, refreshing your energy and recharging your over-stretched batteries. Read | Health infrastructure only 1 per cent of Smart City projects 
SCORPIO, Don't dwell on personal upsets, or even on any successes. Get straight on and deal with all those pressing personal issues, whether you're tackling recalcitrant relations, or reassuring a friend whose confidence has taken a knock. You'll lay down the law, but very gently. 
SAGITTARIUS, The world definitely seems to be going your way - a very fine indication that you can now call the shots. There does still seem to be a great deal of resentment around, but it would be a shame if it spoiled the atmosphere. See that everyone keeps smiling. Read | Maharashtra accounts for a third of all cases, shapes Covid map 
CAPRICORN, Secrecy is the order of the day. Just why you must keep something to yourself is your business, but other people will need a certain amount of reassurance. Monetary matters continue to look prosperous as long as you calculate the odds involved in any risk. AQUARIUS What other people want to know is whether you are genuine about pursuing a particular ambition, or whether you will falter at the last hurdle, as you so often have done in the past. What they don't know is that Saturn, planet of hard work, is giving you the power to complete almost any task. Read | Yogi Adityanath: States will have to seek nod before employing UP workers 
TAURUS, The Moon now indicates that your mood will change for the better. You will become more confident, if a little emotional. You should have sufficient faith in yourself to show your true feelings instead of keeping them concealed. It's all a matter of not worrying what other people think! 
GEMINI, As the hours pass you may begin to feel that you need more privacy. You may be entrusted with a secret and could even consider cancelling a social outing. What now seems certain is that you are set on a new course in all relationships, both casual and intimate. CANCER If you're travelling today, you should be prepared for adventure, and also to end up somewhere quite different from where you intended! In all discussions, it seems to be personal opinion rather than truth which will hold the day. But then, that's just what you're used to! 
LEO, You may feel free to be a little more selfish today than of late. You have given enough to other people, and now it is time to look after yourself once again. Watch out for spiralling financial costs, and take the necessary action. Don't let anyone take you for a ride. 
VIRGO, Today's colourful planetary picture awakens a crusading spirit which has already been glimpsed and could be even stronger next week. You may be as enthusiastic as you like, but never expect others to agree with you. Perhaps you should try to respect friends' opinions a little more. 
LIBRA, If you're working today, or otherwise preoccupied with routine chores, especially charitable acts, you may not know where to stop. The last thing you should do is to leave yourself worn out and flat on your back! Pace yourself properly, and relax when you need to. 
SCORPIO, All the most important planetary aspects are aligned in social areas of your chart. The net result should be that you'll be meeting new faces, letting your hair down and enjoying yourself as never before. Oh, and don't let routine commitments hold you back. 
SAGITTARIUS, There seems to be a conflict of interest between your or a partner's professional duties on the one hand, and family commitments on the other. Right now, private life may have to take precedence over professional. People to whom you have made promises need to come first. 
CAPRICORN, Everything in your solar chart shouts about a new restlessness. This is partly to do with a desire to travel and encounter new ideas and people, but also with a feeling that life should be more enjoyable. After all, you have put in your share of hard work. AQUARIUS Today's planetary picture denotes the possibility of large transfers of cash. It's unclear, however, whether this will be put to good use, or whether you'll be tipping your savings into a financial black hole! Neither is it certain whether it will all happen in your dreams! 
TAURUS, Your dominant planetary patterns today are rather lively, yet there's a deep, meditative quality as well. You may wish to spend more time by yourself and could consider cancelling a social engagement. Yet you will also be reviving old plans or hearing from long-lost friends. 
GEMINI, It is not possible to say whether social or professional arrangements are more important today. However, such distinctions are irrelevant, for what does matter is that you throw yourself into team activities which are destined to attract personal prestige and status. CANCER This is the last time you should hide in the corner or shelter under your stone. Take a deep breath and propel yourself into the centre of the stage, hogging the spotlight and hopefully taking a large share of the glory. I have to say that this is nothing less than you deserve. 
LEO, Don't be surprised if the odd legal problem should occur, however trivial. It's all a question of knowing your rights and not being over-awed by authority. Also, begin to reconsider a dodgy financial question, and stay alert for news from overseas. 
VIRGO, The moment has come to present others with the bill for your services. Don't think purely in cash terms, though, for there may be emotional duties which people can perform. Do be careful not to muddy the waters for, if you create confusion now, it may get worse by next week. 
LIBRA, Today's Moon sets up a series of emotional challenges, so you might surmise that it will not go smoothly. Neither should it. It is at moments like these, you see, that you learn those important lessons about other people's true nature and decide who you really want to be with. A new dawn beckons! 
SCORPIO, If there is a virtue at the moment then it's consistency. You shouldn't falter at work, or in any task of a thoroughly routine nature. Take difficulties in your stride and use them to build up your confidence and experience. Plus, romantic stars continue to show signs of increasing passion. 
SAGITTARIUS, The scope for personal pleasure is greater than for some time, which should be good news. After taking circumstances into account, you should try to make all aspects of your life as personally fulfilling as possible. Whatever happens, keep your eye on the future. 
CAPRICORN, Life is looking a little complex. Don't try to keep the lid on at home, but allow a release of emotional pressure. Otherwise the head of steam that builds up will explode sooner or later, removing your choice and pushing events in a direction that may not suit you. AQUARIUS Financial commitments could soon prove costly, but not just yet. The helpful news is that there is nothing that will now be done that cannot be undone at a later stage. You are therefore on to a winner! But don't be too complacent though, and keep your options open. 
TAURUS, You should maintain a high social profile if that is what is called for, but pay more attention to your own private, inner world. Never was it more true that you cannot live by bread alone, so follow your dreams. Your vivid imagination might even be one of your greatest assets. 
GEMINI, You may make a strenuous effort to get people on your side. Even if it seems like a waste of time, persuading partners that you are right will at least help you get your act together. Also, be prepared for employers or colleagues to change their plans. CANCER You are a creature of extremes, simultaneously ultra-sensitive and hyper- ambitious! Most of your life is spent trying to find a middle path, but right now you should let your ambitions off the leash. One word of caution is to avoid treading on anyone else's toes, even without meaning to. 
LEO, Characteristically, your chart is split between the ultimately profound and the determinedly trivial. The first pattern urges you to seize the moral high ground, while the second lends support to holiday and travel plans. This sounds like the perfect recipe for an interesting life. 
VIRGO, You may break the habit of a lifetime and stop counting your cash. Never was it more apparent that what you must do is spend whatever is necessary to secure your private and personal happiness. If you are thinking about a long-lost loved one then you never know, they might be about to reappear. 
LIBRA, Partners are bound to be in a difficult mood, but whether this is a bad or a good thing is a moot point. The best approach is probably to realise that they are simultaneously trying to do what is best for you and for them, and having a hard time of it! 
SCORPIO, Mars, the symbol of your current success, is still in an emotional mood. This is bound to cramp your style a little, but only if you fail to realise that life, even at work, can be fun. Your number one priority should be to enjoy yourself, and not to be too bothered by lingering difficulties. 
SAGITTARIUS, If there are signs that certain family or domestic concerns are less important now than last week, or last month, don't believe them. It is at moments like these that you can drop your guard and get caught out. After all, you never know what's just around the next corner. 
CAPRICORN, You are now entering a phase of all-round change, not as great for most of you as those which have occurred regularly over the recent times, but powerful nonetheless. The most extreme option is a move of home, while some sort of domestic upheaval is on the cards for all of you. AQUARIUS Dialogue and discussion are the new priorities. There is no better thing you can do over the next forty-eight hours than unburden yourself of family guilt or resentments going back to the distant past. Do so with due regard for others' sensibilities. 
TAURUS, Your social stars are strong, so you may as well face the fact that there's little to be gained from going it alone. You'll benefit far more from linking up with like-minded people and forming a little team. There's also a chance that a child or younger relation will come up with a pleasant surprise. 
GEMINI, Most planetary activity now takes place in the upper reaches of your solar chart, signifying that public pressures should be more important than personal. In other words, social expectations now exert a crucial impact on your thoughts and emotions. CANCER Dream on, especially if romance is on the cards. From the planetary point of view, there could be no better time for adventures with loved ones, so please do whatever you can to keep routine chores to a minimum. There's nothing to be gained from piling up the pressure. 
LEO, Mercury, Venus and Mars have reduced their combined pressure. That means that while obvious difficulties may have been removed, there are still certain hurdles to overcome, not the least of which is your capacity to doubt yourself. A little extra confidence is needed! 
VIRGO, It's time to explore your feelings, whether of guilt or resentment, hope or desire. Only by letting your emotions roam and your imagination wander will you get a true picture of what it is that you truly require from partners and loved ones - and what you can give in return. 
LIBRA, Please do not imagine that conditions at work have been finally agreed. The curious point is that even though everyone is now acting on what has been decided, certain ideas will soon once again be thrown into the melting pot. In fact, it could all be up for grabs. 
SCORPIO, Don't rule out the possibility of enforced changes in your life, but first realise that you have brought current conditions on yourself, and then that while Venus is so intriguingly aligned, the outlook is excellent for a happy outcome. 
SAGITTARIUS, You won't get very far unless you realise that family members need to be persuaded that you are right, and that domestic irritations should be dealt with now! You might not be the cause of some current problems, but you can certainly be part of the solution. 
CAPRICORN, Circumstances beyond your control are about to unmake a decision that you thought had been finalised. Look upon all uncertainty as a welcome opportunity for you to change your mind and attitudes. What's more, what seems like a good idea this week might not look so rosy next. AQUARIUS It's fair to say that an astrological period of great importance is still with you, but you must accept that major change is unlikely in the near future. Instead you should work with what has already happened, and consolidate all improvements in relationships so far. 
TAURUS, It is almost impossible to see whether you'll be conducting an argument in your head with imaginary opponents, or if it will all break out into the open. Whatever the final outcome, you should leave no stone unturned in your search for the ultimate truth. 
GEMINI, There's something rather magical about this week's planetary alignment. Your greatest strength should be your confidence and belief in your own future, so you may banish self-doubt to the far fringes of existence. And if a friend offers you some much-needed help, don't be too proud to accept. CANCER If a project or duty at work seems to be coming unstuck, your best option could be to take a step back to your previous position, and see what you did right. Then you'll discover the best way forward from here. It's all very logical really, in spite of what other people think. 
LEO, You're now into a forty-eight hour phase of potentially extraordinary extravagance. Of course, unless you have large bills due, it is up to you how far you go down the road of converting your hard-earned savings into luxuries and treats. I'm sure you'll stay within your means. 
VIRGO, All great generals know when to make a tactical retreat, maybe even by losing a battle in order to win the war. This same strategy also occurs in the most profound oriental mysticism, so be wise and bend with the times. There's another possibility here, and it's that someone else will hand you victory on a plate! 
LIBRA, Partners may appear to be domineering, but in fact they're probably all bluff and bluster. You may confront them or ignore them, depending on your fancy, but in either case you have nothing to worry about. The main thing you have to do is keep a steady nerve. 
SCORPIO, So enjoyable and creative is today's planetary potential that it would be a crying shame if you were to be chained to an unavoidable routine at home or at work. Make strenuous efforts to instil your personal talents into all activities at every turn. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should do yourself a favour and spend as much attention as is necessary to dealing with domestic issues, especially family relationships. Don't be worried about opening an emotional can of worms, for your fears are massively exaggerated - and may come to nothing. 
CAPRICORN, Dialogue is absolutely crucial, obviously favouring those of you attending interviews or otherwise having to sell yourselves. Go for a poetic approach and don't just repeat the facts - give them a deeper meaning. You might even find that an apparently dull activity contains hidden interest. AQUARIUS This should be a time for spending, with the emphasis on domestic items, but not necessities. I mean, there's always room for a little extra luxury. You should perhaps try to get hold of something that you once set your heart on, but were unable to obtain. 
TAURUS, Taurus: It's important to consider the week as a whole and realise that this is a moment to concentrate on spiritual and mystical interests. It is also extremely important to avoid all gossip and false rumours. For some reason certain people seem anxious to mislead. Don't listen to them. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Generally, positive planetary alignments should help you to press ahead with a favourite ambition, no matter how small. Today, you have a valuable opportunity to resolve legal matters, answer ethical questions or arrange travel plans. There might also be a possibility of studying a new interest.

Also, if anyone owes you a debt, whether payable in cash or kind, now is the time to call them to account. Romantic influences continue on a broadly favourable course, perhaps because a friend seems ready to please. 
LEO, Leo: It's a day for partnership, and hence for sharing, but a week for self-exploration, and so for pursuing your own goals regardless of what other people say or do. You may therefore be performing a careful balancing act today. I'm sure you'll manage! Follow Cyclone Amphan LIVE updates 
VIRGO, Virgo: Always wait, look, listen and learn. This, you see, is nothing if not a time for patience, no matter that you do quite rightly feel a little frustrated or resentful at being passed over a long time ago. If life has taught you anything, it's that there's always a second chance. You just have to keep your eyes open. Read | Family in dark, Covid positive father found dead at bus stop 
LIBRA, Libra: The scales might fall from your eyes. Even if you do discover that someone close is not a paragon of virtue, this is going to be a time when you will have to realise that you should have stood on your own two feet, anyway. Then you would never have risked disappointment, would you? 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There is no way for you to predict or gauge how either home or career matters will develop. Everything depends on your approach which, while being businesslike, should also be spontaneous and flexible. You may accept relations' little ups and downs, and offer them all the support they need. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: To say that you should be able to turn almost any situation to your advantage may sound a little exaggerated at present, but that's because you're not yet aware of the broader pattern. By the end of the week you'll be cruising along with the world at your feet. Read | Two friends go home today, one of them dead 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Although this is a day to focus on finances, there is little in your chart to indicate important developments. It may therefore be no more than a case of keeping an eye open for bargains, but always with due regard for your long-term security. After all, you don't want to squander your assets. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The ball definitely appears to be in your court today. You should therefore be able to put your foot down at home but, with such power comes the responsibility to use your advantages wisely. In other words, it's a day for good deeds! And whatever you do, I hope you'll be appreciated. 
TAURUS, You'd be a fool not to indulge yourself now that Venus is so pleasantly placed, so do make an almighty effort to keep routine chores to a minimum and allow some time for yourself. You might meet a very fascinating stranger, perhaps someone who will be important in your life over the coming years. 
GEMINI, Monday's Moon falls deep in powerful parts of your chart, restoring your morale and re-energising the parts that other stars fail to reach. It might be Wednesday before you feel confident enough to have your say without worrying about what people will say in return. Opinion | If there's no additional borrowing, there can be no additional expenditure, no fiscal stimulus Cancer You'll be keeping your cards close to your chest until mid-week at least, treasuring your fantasies and perhaps sharing a secret with a special confidant. Yet the Moon's shift of position after Wednesday could bring everything that's been hidden into the open. 
LEO, It's difficult to gauge your mood, for you may be bright and sociable one moment, quiet and secretive the next. You might even stretch a partner's patience to the limit. A minor financial earthquake is on the way, but hopefully it will bring no more than a brief blip in your business affairs. 
VIRGO, Finally, at long last and after an incredibly extended delay, energetic Mars approaches the beginning of a new cycle. The happy result is that personal hopes and projects which have been stalled since last year will soon be under way. Family members will support your progress. Opinion | In a democracy that aspires to building free market economy, all govt needs to do is get out of the way 
LIBRA, You're entering a fascinating new cycle, one which continues until next month. You'll be working behind the scenes for part of the time, keeping many of your actions secret and letting only the chosen few into your private world. A financial windfall is on the way at the end of the week. 
SCORPIO, Could you be chasing a lost love? Perhaps! The stars indicate nostalgia for passions past, yet don't fall into the trap of judging a present partner according to what happened long ago. Nostalgia is all very well, but needs to be kept within strict limits. Read | For every dead in Auraiya accident, a lakh are waiting to return home 
SAGITTARIUS, You're still impaled on the horns of a dilemma, wondering whether to go ahead with a major personal adventure, or to hold back. In the short-term you'll prevaricate and postpone, so partners will have to be patient, won't they? Travel plans may be subject to slight delays, but nothing you can't handle. 
CAPRICORN, Bit by bit the mist is clearing. And little by little, day by day, your special long-range goals are becoming easier to achieve. In love, amorous individuals are primed to enjoy a romantic affair. Those of you with responsibility for children will have your hands full. Read | In Auraiya truck: Some who failed to get on train, workers denied wages AQUARIUS What do you fancy this week? A shopping trip? An extravagant outing? A flutter on the stock exchange? One way or another, it's business which comes first and, if you're lucky, you'll be spending someone else's money. In love, it is old-fashioned romance which suits you. 
TAURUS, Opportunities for change and variety should be seized for two reasons. First, they seem to be relatively risk-free, and secondly they make a welcome rest from the long-term trend in your chart, which is profoundly serious. A break is as good as a rest, as they say. 
GEMINI, Happily everything which is optimistic, changeable, sociable and full of life is emphasised today. Mind you, you'll be in no mood to waste your time. As usual, you will do yourself a mighty favour if you listen to partners and give them the first bite of the cherry. CANCER The happiest individuals could be those at work today. If you're taking time off then the best leisure pursuits should be those which encourage you to compete, and give you the chance to shine in front of your friends. There's nothing wrong with showing off! 
LEO, You may splash out some money if that's the best way to stay happy. It has been observed that 'shopping therapy' really does have beneficial side effects just as long as you spend only that which you have, and not that which belongs to others! 
VIRGO, Financial matters grab the headlines. In brief, it's a fine moment for going shopping, haggling and picking up a few bargains. If you're in the property market, there could be welcome signs of movement. However, there's a chance that news which arrives late could make you wonder whether you got a good deal. 
LIBRA, There's no doubt about it: you will have to do what partners want! However, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself. In fact, one of the best ways to have fun may be to put your own desires to one side and experience the world as others do. You never know what you might find! 
SCORPIO, Please keep busy - and don't overlook any essential details. You're moving up to a powerful position at home next week, and the better prepared you are on a practical level, the more space you'll have for dealing with random emotions. You don't want to be caught out by unexpected eruptions! 
SAGITTARIUS, The spark of love could burst into flames if the emotional wind blows from the right direction. Rather than becoming fixated by one particular desire, you should spread your favours around and enjoy whatever life throws at you. Live life to the full! 
CAPRICORN, Even enforced changes in your personal life can do you a power of good. You may imagine that you're out of the woods, and you are indeed right that life has moved on. However, you should never lose touch with all those incredibly valuable insights you've gained. AQUARIUS What really matters is that you explain yourself. It's an excellent day for communication, but by the same token if you fail to make yourself clear, especially at home, misunderstandings could multiply. The last thing you want now is for someone important to get the wrong end of the stick. 
TAURUS, There are people around who are prepared to create havoc if you let them. The risks seem slight at the moment but they will grow, so the sensible thing to do would be to deal with causes of discontent, now. On balance you'll probably lose if you prevaricate for too long. 
GEMINI, There's a simple switch from the desire to compete, to the need to co-operate. Others may be confused by your changing opinions but, then, they often are! Any travel arrangements require an extra check, especially if they're mainly far away or overseas. CANCER You're really rather tenacious when you actually get going. Once you have the bit between your teeth you will be impossible to shake off, as other people will very soon discover. Pity the poor individual who tries to put one over on you! They will soon regret their mistake 
LEO, Recent events should have reminded you that it is a waste of time trying to do things in a roundabout manner, even if you are eager to spare others' feelings. There is no substitute for being utterly open and direct, and no excuse for being lazy! 
VIRGO, You are liable to lose interest in one particular person, or in a prospective social gathering. On the other hand, your desires could become much deeper and more intense, meaning that you'll be fussier about whom you mix with. Quite right, too! 
LIBRA, One thing you should be doing this week is building up personal contacts, so make all those phone calls and send those letters which you've been thinking about for far too long. You never know - perhaps someone may be delighted to hear from you. 
SCORPIO, You know what you want in your heart of hearts. The Sun is shortly to raise all those deep emotional issues, like who you can and can't rely on. Find unusual ways to put your point across, and try a little lateral thinking! The answer is staring you in the face! 
SAGITTARIUS, Can you turn the clock back and grow younger? As the hours pass you will become ever more youthful and spontaneous in your reactions. It will be important to give others the benefit of the doubt, for then they'll be more inclined to indulge your whims. 
CAPRICORN, The general mood of the times is still reasonably sober, which suits many of your underlying serious qualities. It would be very useful indeed if you took the initiative and got other people to talk to each other for a change. There is no substitute for good communication. AQUARIUS Nothing stays the same for ever, least of all your mood. After a possibly uncertain morning you will become ever more confident. There's something about the changing astrological 'weather' that will make you happier to be assertive, independent and in control. 
TAURUS, There's a lightness in the air today which has been lacking over the last few days. You'll find it easier to put serious long-term issues to one side and link up with people who are out to enjoy life. You might be surprised by the strength of a partner's passions, though. 
GEMINI, Your current behaviour is strongly driven by your beliefs, and there are now indications that you could be a little too rigid. It is one thing to have high principles but another to be obstinate when circumstances call for compromise. A little flexibility goes a long way! CANCER Obviously you need to strike while the iron is hot, but whether that time is now is questionable. True, this is a suitable moment, but everything you do will be affected by changing circumstances in the future. That's obvious, I know, but easy to forget. 
LEO, Family members, or people you live with, seem to be playing an inhibiting role, perhaps cramping your style. However, should you feel unduly hemmed in by their habits and demands, think again. You may have unconsciously manoeuvred yourself into the current situation. 
VIRGO, The Moon's challenge to your sign is gently romantic, but it also makes it easier for you to play the passive partner. It could be relaxing to let others go out and take the lead. That way you can share the pleasure if plans work out, but avoid the blame if they don't! 
LIBRA, Challenging planetary aspects caution you not to be reckless or extravagant. Fortunately, there are other indications that you will be in a sympathetic, tolerant and cautious mood, so you're bound to do the sensible thing. Above all, let loved ones know that you really do care about them. 
SCORPIO, This is often a very powerful time of year for you, but your long-term cycles have shifted slightly. If your intuitions are functioning well, next week could bring considerable change, so your current actions are therefore incredibly important. 
SAGITTARIUS, You will no doubt enjoy spending time at home, so hopefully circumstances will permit! If all is in a state of upheaval, or if you absolutely must go to work, you should try to create a cosy and domesticated atmosphere wherever you go. And avoid risks: safety first, as they say. 
CAPRICORN, Financial pressures seem to be closely connected to social commitments. It may be that you have made promises which it will be difficult to fulfil, in which case you may now be able to make a dignified exit. If you can't escape from your commitments, then perhaps you can get some help! AQUARIUS It is high time that you stopped allowing other people to take you for granted. You must recognize, though, that if you have allowed yourself to be undervalued in the past, some of the responsibility lies with you. Not all of it, I have to say, but some of it! 
TAURUS, It's definitely a moment for facing serious issues. Partners will want to know exactly how committed you are, and also to what extent you are prepared to take care of practical questions. What you need most is security. And what you need, you must have! 
GEMINI, You'll have to work hard to achieve your aims. One very important reminder is to watch out for legal complications at work. The vital safeguard is always to be absolutely sure of your rights as well as your duties. But, if you fulfil your responsibilities willingly, then you're more likely to receive what's due to you. CANCER You are certainly in a very serious mood when it comes to relationships. You may be facing a desire for commitment, perhaps deeper than you've known for some while, but it may be impossible to freeze feelings at a particular moment in time. But, then, perhaps that's not what you really want! 
LEO, You may put the spotlight on money, especially on joint business ventures or investments. However, always bear in mind that financial decisions are all too easily swayed by what others want, or by what you feel is expected of you. You will gain by doing the right thing. 
VIRGO, The approaching sober Sun-Saturn picture suits your efficient Virgoan temperament, and you should spare no time for sloppiness and unpunctuality, least of all in yourself. If others fail to live up to your expectations, that's their problem, not yours! 
LIBRA, The financial situation is looking fairly complicated, but there's nothing new in that. You should avoid any temptation to speculate today, and at the very least you may secure whatever sensible and expert advice is necessary. But don't take risks with your own security. 
SCORPIO, It could be crunch-time at home as irreversible force meets immoveable object. Don't be hasty, for it seems unlikely that anything will be resolved until this time next week. And if partners are urging you on, you may explain to them why they're wrong! 
SAGITTARIUS, Although home and family affairs do not seem to be important in your long-term cycles, they figure today in your immediate planetary aspects. You should therefore pay extra attention to matters which may have been allowed to drift. You might even remember something you'd forgotten all about! 
CAPRICORN, You have every right to expect that others will respond to your suggestions in as amiable a manner as possible. You also have a right to demand that partners observe financial propriety. If they let you down, you will be entitled to complain - and loudly! AQUARIUS You're now at a professional and public turning-point and, if you ever had any desire to be praised by your peers for a personal achievement, now is the time to lay yourself on the line. Someone who has misunderstood you will soon mend their ways! 
TAURUS, As the Sun reaches a cosmic encounter with Saturn, one thing is certain; it is time to formalise all casual relationships, and make sure that your role is so well defined that everyone knows exactly where you stand. If your commitments are fuzzy around the edges, then something is bound to be forgotten. 
GEMINI, The one consideration necessary for emotional and social happiness is that you know when to stand back and let partners take the lead. Frequently it will be important to put your own interests to one side. Perhaps you need to rely a little more on your natural wisdom, and less on what other people think. CANCER You'll have to persist with financial and business questions but do be aware of the underlying psychological issues as well. It looks very much as if you have been making value judgments about particular people, and that you may have been wrong. 
LEO, Although the long-term pattern in your chart has much to do with maturity, responsibility and doing the right thing, today's stars have a distinctly irresponsible flavour. If you decide to break out, the choice must be yours. Don't blame anyone else if it all comes unstuck. 
VIRGO, It's a useful moment to consider your physical well-being, cleaning up your diet and sharpening your exercise regime. There's no need to go to extremes, only to follow a sensible middle path. You might even provide a valuable role model for others. 
LIBRA, You are dreaming of a favourite ambition but, if family responsibilities should intervene, it will be children or younger relations who require attention. It's important to lead by setting a firm example rather than merely being negative. 
SCORPIO, You're hoping for a bright future. There's a sense of optimism today, but you could be caught between two options. The problem is that they both seem to be rather desirable. Is it not possible to have your cake and eat it? The stars suggest that it is! 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a very useful moment for getting others to talk about their hopes and fears, and for taking decisions. It goes without saying that if you're attending interviews or other important meetings, you should put on a display of enthusiasm and originality. 
CAPRICORN, Financial matters are still important, and there is a slight risk of a disagreement of sorts, most likely around midday. You may concentrate on your moral values, rather than being distracted by what you can or can't afford. That may be taken care of later. AQUARIUS The Moon's continuing presence in your chart is an excellent indication that you'll be able to substantially lift your morale and increase your confidence. The Moon also obliges you to be more sympathetic to others, even if they have dug their own hole. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You may as well make an ambitious start to the week. There is nothing in the stars to say that you must do such-and-such a thing, but there are certain rewards which are yours for the asking just as long as you lay yourself on the line and say what you want. 
GEMINI, Gemini: There's a fiery influence in your chart for the entire week. This strange but enthusiastic planetary pattern will be stronger at some moments than others but, on the whole, it is due to keep you happily stimulated, energetic and full of hope. Read | Explained: What labour law changes mean CANCER Cancer: You're liable to experience a repeat performance of current emotional conditions in about four to five months' time. This alone should be enough to force you to deal properly with current personal questions rather than sweeping them under the carpet. 
LEO, Leo: For the next day or so you would do well to let partners take first place. You can afford to be patient, for your time will come within about four days. In the meantime, you stand to benefit from others' actions and ideas. That alone is worth the wait! 
VIRGO, Virgo: Get off to a determined start and pack as much into the beginning of the week as you can. Your most practical planetary alignment encourages you to relax, for if you are free from unnecessary pressure you will be ready to tackle all those important tasks. Read | Mismatch in Covid toll: Delhi govt admits to ‘incorrect', late reports 
LIBRA, Libra: It's important to start the week in an optimistic mood, determined to express your individual talents. Try a little experimentation and don't let others put you down or force you into some stale rut. Remember what they say - 'variety is the spice of life'. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: ‘First things first' is your only possible personal motto today. The best way forward is to tackle fundamentals, and that could mean dealing with questions of home and family before considering career and worldly matters. And while you're at it, complete unfinished tasks - the ones you were hoping would go away! Read | Migrant workers in Bihar's Gopalganj: ‘Don't mind quarantine if it ensures safety of family' 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Witty Mercury and graceful Venus could not be a better combination of planets, so your luck is in. All that is required of you is that you are charming, tolerant, sympathetic and always ready to see the other point of view. That shouldn't be too much trouble! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn:: Today's Mars-Neptune aspect could do wonders for your poetic powers of expression, but there's also a danger that your personal fantasy could obscure the facts. There's nothing wrong with this, just as long as you keep your feelings in perspective. Read | Explained: Why Florence Nightingale matters today, how her legacy is under cloud AQUARIUS Aquarius: It's one of those sensitive and emotional days when it's possible to pick out hourly changes in your mood. For example, around mid-afternoon there'll be very strong pressure to deal with a financial dilemma and, then, after dusk a feeling that your burdens are already lifting. 
TAURUS, A rather special set of Venus, Mercury and Pluto alignments indicates that you'll be smitten by a secret passion - with beneficial results in business and finance, as well as in your personal affairs. As far as children or younger relatives are concerned, please put any suspicions to one side. Follow Coronavirus India LIVE Updates  
GEMINI, Your attention has turned to legal matters and, even if it's just an overdue library book, you should do your best to get all loose ends tied up by the end of the week, otherwise they could rebound on you in a few months' time. In love, you're about to revive an old fantasy. Cancer If you're feeling a little in the dark, I'm not surprised! I doubt whether other people have made sufficient attempts to explain themselves, and it may be up to you to fill in the missing pieces. In love, Tuesday and Wednesday look like your brightest days, so arrange your affairs as sociably as you can. Read | Mother's Day 2020: Date, history, and significance of the day 
LEO, You're not about to suffer fools gladly, yet you must be aware that if you explode, partners and relations will respond in kind. It's now preferable by far to heal old wounds than risk causing new ones. Colleagues and employers will expect you to handle more than your share. 
VIRGO, Sometimes you wake up and wonder just what you're doing. The whole point behind one particular personal ambition seems to have been lost a long time ago. My advice now is to press ahead with what must be done in the short-term and wait for the expected long-term success. 
LIBRA, You're basically a people person. In other words, you're happiest when you have good partners to collaborate with. There is absolutely no doubt that the way forward lies through social contacts. In fact, it's exciting outings which get first call, so accept unusual invitations. Also Read | Five iconic moms of Indian television 
SCORPIO, You're in no mood to compromise, yet the last thing you want to do now is blame someone who has done nothing. You must take great care, especially at work, for employers need your respect. You should look up to authority, otherwise you may be denied a financial opportunity, and that would be a great shame. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may make the most of a brief burst of glory. In fact, it really doesn't matter whether your audience is large or small, just as long as you receive the positive acclaim which you deserve. At work you must discuss your very deep long-term hopes and concerns, otherwise employers will misunderstand your intentions. 
CAPRICORN, If your social diary is empty, you're probably lucky. The whole scene is an emotional minefield and, as you venture out, you'd best be prepared! Even if you're ready for excitement you may get more than you bargained for! You might be tempted to work hard in order to escape from personal battles. AQUARIUS You'll soon enter an entirely new, and very welcome, phase at home. Over the next few weeks you'll either have the decorators in, or you'll be splashing the paint about yourself - and getting ready for a family party. You might even be surprised when someone close decides that they're on your side for a change. 
TAURUS, There is still a great deal going on that's related to the lower recesses of your chart, which suggests that while on the one hand home and family relationships are still vitally important, it is your own individual needs which must take first place. 
GEMINI, The chance of arguments at home is very small but, for some of you, no less real for that. This is why a diplomatic approach might be necessary, even when you are apparently sure of your ground. You see, however certain you are, there will always be information that hasn't come your way. CANCER It is rather convenient that your chart favours short trips and excursions, sometimes with a serious purpose but almost invariably with an enjoyable outcome. The central theme seems to be the need to stay close to your home base, and doing your best by family members. READ | Lack of health workers a concern in cities, govt says must live with virus 
LEO, There is a great deal to be said for putting the brakes on. I don't think you will be compelled to slow down or stop a particular course of action, but a brief pause for thought might reveal some interesting side-effects of recent emotional endeavours. 
VIRGO, You may be right not to trust someone else. It's not that they are unreliable or about to let you down, just that the lines of communication are not smooth. You may enjoy joint activities and shared feelings, but don't feel obliged to explain yourself! 
LIBRA, A simple reading of your chart indicates that a businesslike day favours shopping trips and bargains. On the deeper level, if you have any doubts about a particular relationship, bring them into the open and you may see that there's nothing to worry about. 
SCORPIO, There's a real chance of an emotional squall, but it passes quickly and is easy to avoid with just a little goodwill. The converse is that it's a day when you may sail a smooth course, accomplishing much and risking little, just as long as you watch out for others' interests.

SAGITTARIUS, What on earth have you got to be so secretive about? Perhaps nothing! The simple fact is that while the Moon is in a deep and emotional region, you feel the urge to keep certain things to yourself, and other people should respect your right to do so. 
CAPRICORN, Your businesslike stars are gradually dispersing, reducing your financial concerns. As they move apart, so other considerations come into play, like travel or overseas connections, moral issues and, for some of you, the promise of a new interest or course of study. AQUARIUS Sometimes you just have to wait while other people catch up. Frankly, it now looks as if someone else owes you an apology, but whether you get it is another matter. You will only be prepared to collaborate with partners as an equal when they have made the necessary changes to their lifestyles. 
TAURUS, From a purely personal point of view, your chart speaks of the need to put creative self-fulfilment first. However, other indications suggest that partners' demands or children's needs will overwhelm you. Perhaps you need some help. You'd better ask quickly! 
GEMINI, It is sometimes difficult for astrologers to square your serious attitude to work with your light-hearted reputation. The problem you'll face today is that the past must be addressed before the future can be planned, and that can be a painful process. I have every confidence in you, though. CANCER The Moon is cruising through a region of your chart ruling self-indulgence, so you really should take a little time off to pamper yourself. The only responsibilities you can't dodge any more may come in the form of children, young people and others with vastly less experience than you. 
LEO, Domestic affairs should take priority today. This is not a forecast, but advice which you are free to ignore. My prediction is, though, that if you take no notice of this warning then you could run into a spot of needless bother tomorrow. 
VIRGO, Serious discussions will doubtless perform a vital role in helping you resolve the irritations of the past month and in enabling you to see your way forward to a more hassle-free future. The trouble is that someone just seems to treat everything as a joking matter. 
LIBRA, The entire situation is looking decidedly complicated, probably because you're torn between keeping yourself to yourself on the one hand, and letting everyone else in on the act on the other. You've just got to work out what's important and what's not. 
SCORPIO, The fact that the Moon is now aligned with your sign should put you in a commanding position. The only complicated planetary aspects occur around the early morning when there may be a fleeting doubt about a particular plan. That aside, the world is yours. 
SAGITTARIUS, The main variation in your solar chart is provided by the movement of the Moon's emotional movements, raising hidden hopes from your unconscious. This is all very positive, for if such worries are brought into the open you can do something about them. 
CAPRICORN, There are times when you can find yourself paying for friends. Social extravagance does still seem to be very much a vital factor. In the final analysis, the end result depends on how happy you are to be subsidising other people, perhaps more than whether you can actually afford to do so. AQUARIUS Emotional opposition from other people, mainly close partners, does still seem to be a nuisance, but doesn't have to be so. Your best chance is probably to make a tactical retreat, sure in the knowledge that others will soon burn themselves out, leaving you to clean up. 
TAURUS, All the most intense, harrowing and stressful planetary squares and conjunctions are now in the past. Hopefully, you have survived as a Taurean should, with grace, charm, good manners and an insistence that emotional confrontations are a waste of time. 
GEMINI, The Moon is in a friendly position, which is astrological shorthand for saying that you can afford to relax, and even insist that things are done your way. Just understand that your requests must be phrased extremely sensitively, otherwise you could provoke completely the wrong reaction. CANCER The Sun is about to adjust its position and, when it does, you will gain a new perspective on the financial situation. Today's lunar picture, though, urges you to give a little extra attention to your family relationships: someone seems to think that you have been neglecting them. 
LEO, As the planets shuffle around your solar chart they take you through interlocking periods which can last for anything from a day to a decade. One new celestial phase will see you labouring hard to settle your financial security and, to this end, you may now discuss your plans with those in the know. 
VIRGO, You should now be feeling more confident socially, and this will enable you to function better at work, at home or on holiday. However, if you're a wise Virgo, you'll realise that you are still very vulnerable, so you'll keep your emotional defences at the ready. 
LIBRA, Astrologers describe you as a lover of justice, but that is not the same thing as being honest. In fact, it does now seem that you may be justified in telling a small white lie in order to spare someone else's feelings. It's a matter of fine judgement, but if anyone can do it, you can. 
SCORPIO, Life should be most straightforward for Scorpionic go-getters, who are able to pursue their ambitions with a sensible degree of self-interest. However, if you don't fall into this category, your salvation lies in some sort of community team-work. 
SAGITTARIUS, Continuing pleasant planetary influences draw out your social generosity. I don't mean this necessarily in a financial sense, more that you will be willing to give of your inner self. There's but the merest chance of a slight spot of financial friction later on. 
CAPRICORN, Uranus and Neptune provide a perpetual reminder that life is not as easy as it was always supposed to be. Let me give you some advice which does for the whole year, and that is not to worry unduly if daily certainties start to disappear like a mirage on a hot day. AQUARIUS Your planets are still not playing fair, and you may have been irritated by other people's willingness to move the goal posts. On the other hand, today, you may occupy the moral high ground, which will at least give you some cause for satisfaction. That has to be good news! 
TAURUS, Taurus: The fact that peaceful patterns are strong today makes little sense unless we remember that this is bound to enhance your Venusian qualities. Therefore, if peace is to be made or apologies offered, you should take the lead. There isn't really any other option. 
GEMINI, Gemini: You may wish to take a short journey, but this might not be such a good thing if you are running away from your responsibilities. Your judgment could be a mite too hasty at the moment, so take instant decisions by all means, but realise that you might be wrong! CANCER Cancer: The Sun is proceeding along its present path very nicely, and is almost at the end of its current journey, a symbolic indication that plans should now be finalised and loose ends tied up. Only money still seems to be a source of concern or discontent. 
LEO, Leo: Your planets are looking colourful and it seems that your judgment is very easily influenced by your imagination. This is wonderful if you're in the arts or otherwise engaged in creating a colourful impression, but otherwise you might like to take a little care. 
VIRGO, Virgo: The Moon aligns itself with a potent financial region of your horoscope, conveying the news that money matters need tightening up. Maybe a romantic liaison could provide a useful diversion but, on a more serious note, you may be obliged to deal with some secret information. 
LIBRA, Libra: Saturn, that supremely serious planet, is exerting a terribly responsible influence over your psyche at the moment, yet other indications suggest that if you wish to go completely wild, now is the time. In short, the choice between two extremes is yours. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The long-term developments definitely look promising, even though as far as professional ambitions are concerned there are still risks. Tactlessness is probably your major failing at the present time so, if you don't want to lose a valued friend, think before you speak! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Your current stars are quite lively, but the entire long-term drift in the style and nature of your chart is away from spontaneity and adventure towards seriousness and sobriety. However, even when responsibilities mushroom, you must not forget the need for experimentation. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: A burden should have been lifted in recent days, and you should soon be feeling a great deal more positive. Today's lunar position should also enable you to be rather more direct about your ambitions, which is naturally a helpful indication for those of you pursuing professional goals. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Please don't expect partners to be diplomatic this week, or in any way sensitive to your feelings. But don't take offence either, for they are only trying to tell the truth. There may even be some very fascinating advice concealed in otherwise meaningless statements. 
TAURUS, There's a tension in your chart which is very hard to avoid, although it's impossible to see whether it's you who will be feeling under the weather, or a partner, parent or child. One way or another, you should find ways to bring a little light into your life. 
GEMINI, The central issue no longer concerns money. Instead family relationships will become more important, evoking attitudes and opinions which date back many years. It may therefore be very difficult to establish the real, root cause of current discontent. Perhaps there is no reason! CANCER Today's planetary pattern is quite challenging, but as far as your solar chart is concerned, all pressures are indirect. You may therefore be involved only when other people require your sympathy and support. Actually, they may have earned a favour from you. 
LEO, You may make major decisions by all means, but do take them in the interests of the world as a whole. You don't require any assistance, but other people do, and they can benefit from your breadth of vision. Plus, if you play fast and loose with the rules - you will do so at your own risk! 
VIRGO, Many times in the past you have been called upon to help partners at great cost to yourself. Now, with Venus and Mars in your sign, it is your hopes, desires and feelings which are important. Others' interests may have to take a back seat, just for a while. 
LIBRA, The fact that you are prepared to talk about your plans, but not your actions or feelings, may be as perplexing to you as to other people. It's all a question of distinguishing between what is relevant and what is not. And that, as it happens, is easier said than done. 
SCORPIO, The chances of a futile confrontation are reaching a peak, but don't be dismayed. A positive reading of your chart reveals that with cool, calm sincerity and a willingness to listen, you will soon clear up a major mystery -or even a cause of deep uncertainty. 
SAGITTARIUS, The fact that the Moon alters its position by early evening may arouse some of your Sagittarian social sensibilities but, during the day, professional and other worldly tasks should take first place. The last thing you should do is neglect your friends. 
CAPRICORN, A trio of planets, Mercury, Mars and the Moon, is urging you to consider the ethical considerations, and you may soon be prompted to take a moral stand on an issue you've always taken for granted. As you'll find out, questions of right and wrong are far from cut and dried. AQUARIUS If you can make a partner understand what you're talking about, you're a very lucky person indeed! All the indications suggest that other people will be basically talking to themselves, rather than to each other. Some would say that's the problem with the world today! 
TAURUS, A whole group of planets is now shuffling places, so it's difficult to be certain about anything. Probably the only truly positive piece of good advice today is to make more space for a creative hobby. I think you owe it to yourself to spend more time doing what matters - instead of what doesn't! 
GEMINI, Mercury, the planet which just happens to be your personal ruler, is top of the list for important alignments today. Therefore, you may feel perfectly free to change your mind as often as you want - within reason. It's great when the planets give you permission to behave as you wish! CANCER Important planets are aligned with your sign and, in some senses, you're still the centre of attention, but you probably feel that the real action is moving elsewhere. Only if you are utterly down-to-earth and reliable will you get what you really need. 
LEO, You may begin to think about putting much more energy into the financial arena. The fact that today's lunar influences focus on purely routine needs, may obscure the fact that there are long-term issues to be considered. Still, sometimes you just have to concentrate on day-to-day affairs. 
VIRGO, Venus' emotional alignment is today compounded by Mars and complemented by the Moon. And that's just for starters! You should defy your reputation for being slightly reserved and shy of expressing your deeper feelings. Other people deserve to know what you really think. 
LIBRA, Some people object to secretive behaviour, but it honestly looks as if you'll be doing everybody a favour if you keep yourself to yourself. The fact is that partners are just not ready to hear what you have to say. That's partly their problem, but it could also make things awkward for you. 
SCORPIO, For some time now the planets have been warning about emotional confrontations at work, partly because the results could be costly. Seeing as the relevant aspects are climaxing over the next few days you should keep the peace unless you are prepared for the consequences. 
SAGITTARIUS, Travel and adventure plans are still strong, but there does seem to be an increasing sense of uncertainty or doubt. In point of fact the best vacation will be of a spiritual or subterranean nature, so you could be off on a very mysterious journey indeed. 
CAPRICORN, Your financial prospects are still turbulent. It honestly now looks as if any social disagreement is likely to be triggered by money, or a dispute over who pays for what. Such things may easily be arranged in advance. A romantic fantasy is still bugging you, but there's nothing wrong with dreaming. AQUARIUS That old planet Saturn is now being more helpful over a problem, which means that other people will be less inclined to blame you for their own lack of success. To be perfectly frank, you can probably do with a break, for partners' demands have been building up, unfairly in your opinion. 
TAURUS, The future has to be bright. With a leap and a bound you'll soon be free, leaving behind the burdens of work and everyday responsibility, and waving goodbye to a battle with authority. Don't take on too much, too soon, though, for you'll have a second chance after another few months. 
GEMINI, Mercury is doing its best, and that is cause for rejoicing. For one thing, you'll have all the best ideas. For another, if you play your cards right, success will be served up while you hardly have to lift a finger. Cancer The Moon will soon be in significant regions of your chart, but not just yet, and that means that you'll have to wait a few days for social satisfaction. Your new emotional cycle is increasingly secretive, so you'll be keeping your cards very close to your chest. 
LEO, You've certainly been getting your slice of the action, and now you are ready to reap your share of the rewards. From Thursday onwards, life will slow down, and you'll take the chance to reflect and weigh up the odds. Creative and artistic individuals are now experimenting with new activities at the moment right now. 
VIRGO, You're going through a mildly bumpy patch currently, though nothing you can't handle. Family affairs seem to be moving along nicely, even if there have been one or two hold-ups. These, it must be said, have not been your fault. However, the final outcome in a romantic adventure will be very much to your liking. 
LIBRA, Your romantic stars are mixed. Tuesday and Wednesday are excellent days for declaring your love, but you'll have to put up with partners who want it all their own way: if you can't beat them, you may as well join them. But then, you might not be in a mood to compromise. 
SCORPIO, You're stuck in a sort of cosmic waiting room. One phase of life is over, another is waiting to begin, and in the meantime partners and lovers have it all their own way. Yet an increase in your earnings is now a definite possibility, and one which will transform your life. 
SAGITTARIUS, These are busy days and the more time you spend on all those dull but essential routine chores, the better off you'll be when your dreams come true, first, next month and then a couple of months later. In love, you may go for broke, insisting that a partner accepts your desires without question. 
CAPRICORN, Your planetary energy is at a peak, but that doesn't mean that everything will go with a swing. It's preferable to arrange your own schedule so that you get the right amount of exercise, rest and healthy food. You're about to take a long, hard look at your spending commitments. AQUARIUS You do love other people so much, but now you want a bit of the attention yourself. Plus, some people reckon that your guiding principle in relationships is ‘don't do what I do, but do as I say'. However, as you may have found out, that's not always the best recipe for peace and harmony. 
TAURUS, There's a powerful undercurrent in all your affairs at the moment, sweeping you inexorably towards the future. In fact, you'll soon reach an emotional high tide. It seems inevitable that you must be true to your heart, and this will make it very difficult to compromise. 
GEMINI, You are bound to feel just a little strung out today, perhaps because it looks as if your work is never done. If you put your emotional energy into achieving something of value, rather than frittering your time away, then you will soon begin to reap the rewards. CANCER You should state your case and stick to it. If you know that what you say is an exact reflection of how you feel, there can be little room for compromise. It is up to others to realise that, just now, you have to be you. I'm sure partners will be patient with you. 
LEO, Your planetary aspects could not be more challenging. This is a simple way of saying that difficulties should be welcomed as 'learning opportunities'. You may see this as a chance to grow in wisdom, maturity and confidence, even if partners' behaviour is sometimes wild and unpredictable. 
VIRGO, It's certainly a powerful moment, and you seem to be unduly affected by the way other people think and feel. There may be nothing you can do about it for now, beyond trying to get them to talk about their many fears and desires. Don't judge them too harshly. 
LIBRA, Please don't lose your head just because all around you partners seem to be losing theirs. The most positive way to use your planetary energy at the moment is to get involved in some sort of charitable venture. Do favours for others and you'll benefit within a few years - or even months. 
SCORPIO, You think you know your own mind, but do you? Now is the time to face the facts, as long as you listen carefully to other people's views. The only problem may arise if you are dealing with matters where emotions count for more than do your practical skills. And, above all, don't undervalue your own contribution to the world. 
SAGITTARIUS, This certainly looks like an expensive moment and, if you know what's good for you, you'll stay well clear of dubious financial involvements. Put your emotional suspicions to one side and concentrate on finding out what makes someone else tick. 
CAPRICORN, You are bound to meet your fair share of criticism. In fact the greater the opposition you face, the better, because you'll be forced to sharpen up your act, with good consequences for your social dreams and romantic affairs in particular. AQUARIUS Whatever you're doing, however you feel, there are always balancing factors, and right now excessive secrecy relating to feelings will be compensated for by equally forthright honesty concerning ideas and opinions. As a matter of fact, it may be all thoroughly confusing! 
TAURUS, One region of your chart, ruling travel and communication, is looking extremely lively, but the livelier it becomes, the greater will be your need to exercise due caution and double-check your progress at every turn. There's no requirement to rush it, so you may take your time. 
GEMINI, Employers, or people in positions of power, are likely to show themselves in a different light at the moment, being that much more emotional than usual. However, it is bank managers, and anyone else responsible for your money, who you really need to keep and eye on! CANCER Watch out! Mars is now adopting a new and aggressive position, stirring up feelings you'd probably rather forget. Remember the old rule of war: only fight battles you know you can win. That said, if conflict is not to your taste, it's time to hone your diplomatic skills. 
LEO, There is a right way to manage your affairs - and a wrong way. The golden rule now must be to avoid all forms of intrigue and pay no attention to rumours of any sort. Concentrate on pursuing your own affairs with as much honesty and integrity as you can muster. 
VIRGO, A sensational relationship between Venus and Mars is about to do you a power of good, but only if your behaviour is impeccable. If you insist on maintaining a rigid and outdated set of values, these same planets will seriously undermine you. It's all a question of leading a balanced life and of being human. 
LIBRA, Venus continues to emphasise the practical side of relationships. You may have to make a tactical retreat at work, but this should be balanced by a serious advance at home. It's all a question of weighing up the odds in different situations and, in this, you are a master. 
SCORPIO, The moment has come to speak out and make others see that whatever misunderstandings took place can now be put right. The past is the past, and that is that. Very soon you will personally be in a position to right old wrongs. You need justice  now! 
SAGITTARIUS, Turn your attention to your financial affairs, and take no risks. Resist all pressure and turn down all blandishments, no matter how seductive. And don't trust anybody. It's not that they are necessarily dishonest, just liable to get the facts wrong. 
CAPRICORN, It's make or break time in at least one close tie or association. The question is whether this particular relationship can be made to work, or if it should be put on hold, perhaps indefinitely. It may be a difficult choice, but it will probably have to be taken sooner or later. AQUARIUS You have waited too long for your personal rewards to allow other people to steal your thunder, or exploit your feelings. However, the worst thing you could do at the moment is act on the assumption of suspicions which have only a tenuous basis in reality. 
TAURUS, Your natural instinct for self-preservation is boosted by two very helpful aspects to Venus, the planet which represents your emotional needs and desires. Your intellect and instincts should be functioning as one, so your judgment could be impeccable - hopefully! 
GEMINI, You must get your priorities right. First among these is the need to co-operate with other people, whether at work or at home. It therefore follows that you should be as charming as possible. You must be a good listener for that's one of the best ways to see to it that others do take you seriously. CANCER Not everything works out as expected, but then what would life be like if everything went according to plan? Pretty boring, probably. Bear this reassuring and simple truth in mind over the coming days as partners, loved ones and colleagues start to play up. 
LEO, This is a time for realism. You should accept that errors have occurred and that you'll soon be in a position to work out who was responsible and why. There is no need to apportion blame, only to prevent the same errors being repeated. In fact, if you learn from your mistakes you will deserve praise. 
VIRGO, You ought to be able to ensure that partners are never again in a position to force your hand. However, whether such an aim is realistic is another matter. Probably the best you can do is state your case and attempt to win them over to your way of thinking. 
LIBRA, You may be under some extra pressure at the moment, but it's all friendly. You are being urged to be more outgoing, confident in your ideas and public with your feelings. At all times, come back to the central requirement - the development of your unique talents. 
SCORPIO, People you live with can be very difficult to pin down. Sometimes you wonder what they actually want! As it happens, somebody close should soon alter direction, lifting a burden from your mind. Emotionally, professionally and personally, all the pieces of the jigsaw should now be beginning to fall into place. 
SAGITTARIUS, There may be few individuals who are genuinely happy with recent discussions and agreements. This is partly because your latent perfectionism is coming out, so you can try to see such discontent as very useful, encouraging the desire to do better next time round. 
CAPRICORN, You can't stay as you are for ever - neither do you want to. If new routines or methods are to be accepted, it must be with an option for change in the near future. The point is that it is only when you put your plans into practice that you'll identify the pitfalls. AQUARIUS Secret, hidden or suppressed feelings are once again bubbling over. You should be aware that, even if your behaviour has been impeccable, others could still be annoyed or envious. That may be their responsibility rather than yours, although you might have to sort them out and restore common sense. 
TAURUS, You have every right to do as you please, even more so because others have let you down. Why should you rely on those who have proved unreliable? However, such feelings go against the grain and, at work, especially, you should pay all respect due to authority. 
GEMINI, There is absolutely nothing wrong with being ambitious. The trouble is that you want to come out on top, but you're also usually very idealistic. Avoid the tendency to judge yourself a failure when all around you people are impressed by your success. CANCER A home or domestic matter has been responsible for the odd sleepless night. However, you may now be able to identify the deeper pattern and hence the purpose in recent personal difficulties. You might even find that a delay is really to your advantage. 
LEO, Other people may have been dragging their feet, and no doubt they will continue to do so. You may be even more impatient than usual. However, there are now distinct signs of movement, and you can push things along by the simple matter of getting people to talk to each other. 
VIRGO, Even if you discover that someone is not after all a paragon of virtue there is no need to be disillusioned. This would not be the first time that they have failed the test. Have you considered the possibility that your standards are a little too exacting? 
LIBRA, You should be in high spirits. If you're not, it's because you are failing to see the obvious. The correct course to follow is one which brings out your confidence through learning new skills. It is never too late to sign up for a course, class or training programme. 
SCORPIO, Sometimes you'll do anything to stand up to fresh challenges, but you have been drifting towards escapism recently. The best advice now is to turn and face the questions from which you've been running away. You may not get all the answers, but at least you'll reach some sort of resolution. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're mainly concerned with private and personal matters rather than professional ones. What is agreed or finalised now could safeguard your long-term comfort and security. It's all down to Saturn, planet of stability, a thoroughly mature planet as it happens: you're growing up fast! 
CAPRICORN, Slowly but surely the overall planetary picture is easing. However, there is one last hurdle to clear before you can truly relax and put your feet up. For your own sake do not tie others to commitments they can't fulfil, but give them the time and space they need to come to their own conclusions. AQUARIUS You may make a determined effort to relax today - and give extra thought to your long-term plans. It's one of those friendly periods when others seem to be particularly susceptible to your advances, and when your suggestions should go down well. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Something marvellous is about to happen. Partners, loved ones and colleagues, in fact anyone you're involved with very closely, will change their minds. They may even come out with it and say that you were right all along. Give it a few more days! 
GEMINI, Gemini: Take the initiative, especially at work. You may find that news which has been held up will now arrive, if not today then certainly by the end of the week. When it does appear, you'll be able to clarify your options. Mind you, too many choices could be the last thing you need now. CANCER Cancer: If the current working pattern of your life does not live up to expectations, or if you do not feel that you are being adequately rewarded, it's because you are not drawing on your personal skills. Do something about it! And if someone else has the best ideas then listen carefully. 
LEO, Leo: The Moon encourages you to deal with business, especially anything in which other people are closely involved. The only trouble is that it also heightens your imagination while reducing your grasp of the facts. You may turn this to your advantage. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You should listen to what partners are saying. You may have to be a mind-reader to pick up the full significance of their words and thoughts, and at the very least you'll be forced to read between the lines. But, then, that's the best way to pick up the messages that have passed partners by. 
LIBRA, Libra: There's a chance that you may remain trapped in an emotional rut or oblivious to the many unique opportunities which are beginning to present themselves. Your best approach today should be to tackle routine chores, clearing the decks for the future. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There seems to be reasonable scope for pleasure today. The implication is that even the dullest activity can be livened up if only you would change your attitudes. There's also a chance to improve relationships with children and younger family members. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Sometimes life can be surprisingly logical. For the next few days you will get nowhere unless you start at the beginning, then deal with the middle, and finish at the end. In other words, if you do things out of their proper order you may waste your time. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You have a few days in which to think, talk and ponder the future. The mood of the moment is rather poetic, so you may concentrate on conveying meaning rather than listing the facts. After all, what you really want is for partners to actually understand you! AQUARIUS Aquarius: Your stars are nicely adventurous and certainly very hopeful. Perhaps you can leave all dull and boring matters for next week and exploit every opportunity to socialise, travel and expand your spiritual horizons. The only trouble could be caused by rising costs, so just keep an eye on your commitments and don't promise more than you can afford. 
TAURUS, Taurus: There's no substitute for a good, long look at the evidence and facts may come to light very soon which could totally alter your way of looking at a particular person. However, it may be too late for now to turn whatever you find out to advantage in your career. 
GEMINI, Gemini: It's not always easy to relate to other people but partners and associates must take some of the responsibility for being out of sorts, or at least for behaving out of character. If someone has been getting on your nerves then perhaps it's because they need your help! CANCER Cancer: You should soon come to realise just how fortunate you are, but not this week! Your principle planetary pattern keeps your feelings on a knife edge, but then you're used to performing emotional high-wire acts. You might even teach the rest of us a thing or two about handling relationships. 
LEO, Leo: Some kind of a financial commitment will have to be made soon, but it looks as if you have about three days' grace. Today you'd probably do better to focus on personal relationships, making sure that partners are on your side. Are you forgetting something - or someone? It might do you good to get in touch. 
VIRGO, Virgo: If you need proof of other people's unreliability, you can try a number of steps. First, try to make them reach firm agreements and, second, persuade them to fulfil their promises. The message of the moment is therefore not to push partners too far, at least not if you want to hang on to their goodwill. 
LIBRA, Libra: Helpful aspects from the Moon indicate that in the ideal world you'd be able to take the day off. Realistically the best you can do is try to infuse all routine affairs with a little of your unique creative flare. It's OK to repay favours, but don't let anyone exploit you! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Family affairs dominate your daily cycles, so will doubtless require extra attention, but what is very much more important is that you now burn up the brain cells, concentrating intensely on unresolved questions, gathering all the material you need to make the right decisions. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Sometimes everything seems so straightforward; you may even have come to imagine that you know what's going on. Well, think again! Yet what seems like a cast-iron truth this week might look like complete nonsense next week, so tread cautiously. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Some kind of alteration in the working pattern of your life is inevitable within the next few months. The pressure in this particular cycle is building up now, and one of your major motives should be monetary reward. Perhaps it's time that you're paid what you're owed. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You can afford to feel hopeful about the outcome of all events, both great and small. You must expect a few mood swings, though, and you'll have to try to match your feelings with your jobs and tasks throughout the day. If you succeed then you should allow yourself to feel a little smug. 
TAURUS, The importance of adventurous regions in your chart indicates that you will be looking further afield for your inspiration. People from overseas will offer the hope that life will become more fulfilling, and this realisation may inspire you to travel, or at least to arrange a holiday in the near future. Hopefully your circumstances allow you to organise a break. 
GEMINI, It will soon become apparent that an increase in your earnings will be necessary if you are to finance your lifestyle. Some sort of show-down looks almost inevitable, even if the confrontation is nothing more than a personal one in which you face up to your outdated habits. Cancer The most important thing to remember now is that each day offers unique, never-to-be-repeated opportunities to create new realities and replace old-fashioned, outmoded attitudes. This is a remarkable phase for all Cancerians of an imaginative bent and a wonder-fully creative frame of mind. 
LEO, As ever, your best policy is to get to the root of the problem and deal with underlying causes rather than with superficial symptoms. It may now become apparent that the most advantageous long-term solution is a change of home. But you can stay where you are and persuade other people to move. 
VIRGO, The emotional cycle dominated by Venus' passage through the zodiac is moulding your relationships. From a position in which work and routine cares take first place you will find yourself being drawn into a social circle which may be rather sober, but will be no less fascinating for that. 
LIBRA, When you're in the middle of a situation of conflict it may be difficult to imagine that something of permanent value will emerge. Yet there is no doubt that the harder you strive the more you will learn. You will come closer to discovering the secret of success in your most intimate personal affairs. 
SCORPIO, Mars' magnetic presence must now be taken into account. This planet is rather uncontrollable and is tending to push you into confrontations with friends and lovers. It will be best for all concerned if you develop a little additional patience and tolerance. Partners will admire your increasing energy, though. 
SAGITTARIUS, One part of your character you would do well to develop at the moment is your selfless, almost self-sacrificing side. Is there a charitable activity which you can take up? Or perhaps there is another means by which you can feel you are doing your bit to make the world a better place? If so, get on with it. 
CAPRICORN, As the weeks pass you will become less concerned with the minutiae of details at work and increasingly aware that it is your very individual hopes and wishes which must be given the highest priority. It will profit you nothing if you gain a great deal of money but sacrifice your potential. AQUARIUS You will soon find that it is not enough to spout high-minded statements or lecture other people on how to put the world to rights. Before long, you will have to take positive steps to rearrange your work so that it conforms more closely with what you believe, or run the risk of frustration. 
TAURUS, Taurus: All Taureans who are moving home, or making major personal changes, deserve congratulations for being so utterly in tune with the cosmos. The rest of you must find ways to radically smarten up your domestic conditions and improve your family relationships. 
GEMINI, Gemini: By the time the Sun makes its next important alignment, all that needs to be said should have been said. This is no time to stand on ceremony, and a relaxed and informal approach will help to put everyone at their ease. Short journeys may be necessary, so don't put them off until later. CANCER Cancer: Your finances deserve the top priority but it really doesn't matter whether you're saving or spending. On balance it looks as if extravagance is the favoured option, just as long as you don't object to paying over the odds. What you really need is value for money. 
LEO, Leo: Today's lunar alignments really do give suitable pause for thought. Your planetary influences show unrestrained emotion and passion, and you will have to respond in whatever way suits you best. You might even have to tell other people what they want to hear. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Although it looks as if you may be trying to keep something secret, I don't think you'll succeed, at least not just yet. There are two ideal ways to maximise today's planetary energies - get involved in charitable ventures, and pursue a deepening mystery. 
LIBRA, Libra: When the chips are down you always do your best. This is a time to put yourself out on behalf of others, so don't feel exploited. Stormy social stars could provide a number of unexpected encounters, and a new, unusual, person could be walking into your life. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There's something rather majestic about some of today's celestial events, although that doesn't mean you're going to have an easy ride. Your crisis management skills could be in great demand over the next forty-eight hours, to everybody's benefit! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Two regions of your solar chart are now highlighted, emphasising long-distance travel and adventurous activities on the one hand, career and public ambitions on the other. Where these overlap, you will find your greatest personal success. It's all rather enigmatic! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The sheer length of time you've been pursuing your current course is now one of your greatest assets. You could soon be moving to a new level of personal fulfilment and emotional satisfaction. Plus, travel plans may need checking, or even revising. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Today and tomorrow see the echoes of a series of tough and uncompromising planetary aspects that have been colouring your personal affairs for some while. Now is the time to separate ties and associations which are to continue, from those which may be dropped. 
TAURUS, If ever you imagined that domestic hassles or awkward family relationships could be put off until later, think again. No matter what other people do or say, you must do what you know in your heart to be right and proper. You can't put off the inevitable just by ignoring it. 
GEMINI, It's a relatively lively day, celestially speaking. Probably the best thing you can do for yourself is to revise a few of your attitudes and opinions, and drop those excuses you've been using to justify inaction. It doesn't matter what you do, just as long as you do something! CANCER When all is said and done, money still seems to be the most important factor in your life. It may be best to consider the matter from the psychological perspective, for the extent to which you value yourself and your loved ones is more important than how much cash you have in your pocket. 
LEO, This really can be a special time of year, as one by one the planets line up in your honour. The trouble is that life's still not easy, but don't mistake obstacles or over-commitment for misfortune. Quite the opposite: a chance problem may help you to refine your talents and skills. 
VIRGO, Mercury, your planetary ruler, has switched roles, somewhat prematurely in my opinion. Don't be disappointed if it begins to seem that a recent promise or commitment will not be fulfilled. Strange as it appears, any delay will be well worth the wait. 
LIBRA, The social dimension is becoming stronger, which means that in work or in any equivalent major ambition, other people are now becoming increasingly important. Never imagine that you'll get your way without a large measure of support. If you try to go it alone, you might not get there! 
SCORPIO, You're undecided about what you should do and uncertain about what's expected of you. Even if you decide to back-track on one particular social engagement, it may be too late to call it off. In any event, all professional Scorpios are about to hit a new high at work. Congratulations! 
SAGITTARIUS, The ever-present influence of Jupiter, planet of growth, enhancing the principled and spiritual dimensions of your character, is about to receive another shot in the arm from the Moon. On a purely mundane level, it's vital that you know your rights. 
CAPRICORN, Your emotional situation is about to change, hopefully for the better, although it might not seem that way at first. Long-distance love is still the theme, so it's very much a question of absence making the heart grow fonder over the coming few weeks. AQUARIUS Saturn, that serious and sober planet, is still an extraordinarily powerful factor. However, the feelings of stability which it has been nurturing are being increasingly overwhelmed by your deepening desire for a personal revolution and for more respect and recognition.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The ever-present influence of Jupiter, planet of growth, enhancing the principled and spiritual dimensions of your character, is about to receive another shot in the arm from the Moon. On a purely mundane level, it's vital that you know your rights.

Long-distance love is still the theme, so it's very much a question of absence making the heart grow fonder over the coming few weeks. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Saturn, that serious and sober planet, is still an extraordinarily powerful factor. However, the feelings of stability which it has been nurturing are being increasingly overwhelmed by your deepening desire for a personal revolution and for more respect and recognition. 
TAURUS, Like most people, you are blessed with a planetary alignment which confers inspiration and imagination. What is more impressive in your chart is the manner in which your creative powers and spiritual aspirations are triggered. You should always try to see the best in people. 
GEMINI, Continued close attention to a financial matter is desirable, although not essential. When other people abandon their responsibilities, you will be the one who knows where to turn, for you have an amazing wealth of experience to draw on from the past. CANCER Your daily planets reveal this to be a special day if you have proposals to put forward and arguments to win. However, the long-term perspective evokes deep memories and could cause you to reflect on all those things which happened so long ago. Hopefully, certain recollections are no longer as painful as they were. 
LEO, Secrecy is not one of your better-known characteristics, but today you really have to keep something to yourself. Don't worry about deceiving partners as long as there is no self-interest involved. It may be, for example, that you keep something from them for their own good. 
VIRGO, If you are beginning to feel as if you're walking up the down escalator, then you're probably pretty much in tune with the stars. The secret is to change direction now before you end up in the wrong place! You won't lose the thread completely, even if other people think you have. 
LIBRA, Carry on with all-important professional moves, regardless of associates' potentially time-wasting or disruptive actions. If you give charitable activities a high priority you will do what the mystical philosophers call 'making merit', with many good results in the future. 
SCORPIO, Pluto has played a profound role in your chart for many years, so the emotional intensity is nothing new. On the other hand, occasionally a new pitch of excitement is reached, and, right now, under the Moon's powerful sway, you may demand a new level of commitment. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your material and business interests may have to come first, no matter how much you have to spend or invest. If you have any uncertainties at work, or in any major public ambition, you may put important developments on hold until the picture is clearer. 
CAPRICORN, Sober Saturn and jovial Jupiter are once again being activated, reminding everyone that you are much more than the materialistic stereotype of an astrological cliche. Don't be afraid to speak your mind, or break out of the rut in which you have buried yourself! AQUARIUS Spare a little time for your physical well-being, and use the opportunity provided by today's lunar position to clean up your diet and check out a new fitness regime. Don't be perturbed by a financial delay, but keep an eye on other people, just to make sure that they're doing what they said they'd do. 
TAURUS, Taurus: If you have ever wondered why you experience bouts of financial indecision, it's because it's all in the stars! Actually, there is a way out if you would just put your fears and worries to one side and stop allowing your feelings to interfere with your good sense. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The Moon's continued alignment with your sign is a direct indication that the world lies at your feet, speaking metaphorically of course. The fact is, though, that a mighty act of self-sacrifice may be necessary if you are to make the most of partners' support. CANCER Cancer: Your mystical aspirations are being stirred up and this process creates a sort of ‘divine discontent' leaving you deeply ambitious. You're reluctant to settle for anything less than the best - but you should consider whether a temporary compromise would be a good idea. 
LEO, Leo: A number of very powerful alignments have remained in vital areas of your chart, in spite of the fact that the main gaggle of planets has moved on. You should therefore keep up your guard and resolve never to be caught out again, at least, not by the same person! 
VIRGO, Virgo: If there are choices to be made, try to clarify your ideas today, and recognise that change may not only be necessary but also desirable. Devote additional time to professional responsibilities, and don't shrink from taking on new tasks. Do your best! 
LIBRA, Libra: The Moon makes a helpful relationship to your sign, and it should be responsible for a fair amount of emotional support. It may therefore not matter that you might forget a couple of important engagements or promises! After all, it's about time that other people shared the responsibility. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Social stars do seem to be strong and growing stronger, an indication that you can find solace in other people's arms. The one condition seems to be that old friends will prove a good deal more reliable than new. You're so much happier with people you can trust. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Professional commitments will soon take over, but even though there are definite indications of hard work ahead, you are about to change your mind. You might decide that you have better things to do than waste your time on people who don't deserve it. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There is still every sign of the need for hard work, which may not be very exciting but is no less necessary for all that. Mercury, planet of the mind, will soon make you realise that traditional values were always the best, in spite of what you thought. AQUARIUS Aquarius: As sober Saturn gradually shifts its position, so your grip on certain vital ties and commitments may weaken. However, this may be no bad thing if it enables you to start all over again with a fresh plan. The main point to remember is that all future actions must be firmly rooted in the past. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Check up on the financial situation, and don't hang around if family members need putting right about who pays for what. You probably won't reach a lasting agreement, but that shouldn't stop you arguing your corner. You could do well in interviews and discussions at work, by the way. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Venus' curious motion is taking you back to the past, evoking memories of former loves. In many respects that's no bad thing, although there are certain indications that you'll begin the day on the wrong foot. You must realise that nothing is final and that everything can be changed. CANCER Cancer: It's a day for differences of opinion, and that goes for all twelve signs. Yet in your case it does seem very likely that you won't really understand what's being said, so you may be well advised to bide your time. Patience is an admirable virtue. 
LEO, Leo: The Sun and Moon are gradually moving towards another enthusiastic alignment. Therefore, when you come to look at today's arrangements and offers, you should bear in mind that your ideas, thoughts and actions may not make sense for another few days. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Mercury, your planetary ruler, is sowing the seeds for some truly amazing ideas and meetings, but you will have to put the brakes on within a few days. If you now insist on carrying your ideas to their logical conclusion, you may end up in the middle of nowhere! 
LIBRA, Libra: Strangely enough, a current development may be so secret that not even you know what's going on. Indeed, it looks as if you are about to be overwhelmed by forgetfulness! You may entertain yourself by associating with unusual people and visiting new places. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Do spare a little time to sort out all those niggling cash questions, especially if other people are involved. Only when the Moon settles down next week will a public or professional problem be solved. Until then you may have to make do with half an answer. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The Moon's various challenges to your sign will bring criticisms from partners and people you live with. This could be exceedingly helpful for, although it may be annoying when other people claim to know best, the fact is that they may indeed be right! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Do keep yourself busy, but don't lose sight of the larger picture. The events and questions which concern you at work may be downright trivial compared with the wider ethical and moral issues. Success will count for little if yo alienate partners in the process. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Now that a financial arrangement is going into reverse you must be very wary of seductive promises and cast-iron guarantees. There is very little to gain from taking risks today, and nothing to be said for taking loved ones' lasting support for granted. 
TAURUS, Remember that to serve others is one of the most noble ways to use your time. If you clearly have other people's interests at heart as much as your own, you will be above criticism. Those of you who have planned a brief break are also in tune with your planetary influences. All of you will discover that overseas contacts are more important than you once thought. 
GEMINI, Nobody can be sure what they think, least of all you! Opinions are altering all over the place, so don't be surprised if other people decide that they have had enough of a particular course of action. If they withdraw from their commitments, this may well let you off the hook. Financially the prospects are good, but you'll meet delays here - so be prepared. CANCER Your emotional life is still very complicated, but this is not because fate is being unkind to you. Rather, it is a result of your past eagerness to take on so many new schemes and interests. Actually, any increased readiness to experiment with new lifestyles can only do you good. It could also benefit you financially. 
LEO, Your most important planet at the moment is fiery Mars which is lined up with friendly and optimistic parts of your chart. This should help you yield the most of all those wonderful, spontaneous and creative talents which make you such a charming and attractive person. You're so persuasive that it's difficult to think of anyone resisting you. 
VIRGO, Romantic prospects are starting to look so much brighter than before, all the more so if you abandon yourself to sheer pleasure. You may be starting to develop new creative talents and you would be advised to learn a skill, perhaps attend a class, which will allow you to express your very special, individual gifts. 
LIBRA, You're so impatient that you're likely to overlook vital details. Romantically, things are looking up. Venus, that affectionate planet, is boosting your socia life and, in love, it will be companionship which counts for most. You'll want to hang out with people who share your general attitudes. Even those of you in settled relationships will be having pleasant and refreshing encounters. 
SCORPIO, This is likely to be a very expensive time of year, and your outgoings probably exceed your income. However, you can be sure that all hard work will be rewarded with extra cash before long, if not in time to subsidise additional spending. Plus, I should think that any extra cash put into adventurous schemes will be well worth it. 
SAGITTARIUS, This is an ambitious period of the year but, first of all, you must satisfy your emotional goals. It is time to mend fences if there have been any arguments - and to broaden your horizons. Romantic hopes may call you away from home before long and the people you're attracted to may be from backgrounds very different from your own. 
CAPRICORN, The financial pressures are still strong and, if you're spending wildly, you're in tune with your stars. Yet, you'll be adopting a more sensible approach in all domestic matters, saving for the future and seeing to it that you have cash set aside for those all-important social costs. But you'll be drawn back to financial cares even in your closest relationships. AQUARIUS The most positive way to handle your current transits is to recognise that you must follow your hunches, act on the basis of intuition, allow free rein to your imagination and indulge your dreams. You should also give far more prominence to pure romance than has often been the case. 
TAURUS, Taurus: The great news is that cash is about to flow in, giving you the go-ahead for various schemes and long-awaited purchases. You have maybe two or three days to wait for the perfect alignment. Patience is a virtue you have in abundance, and right now it's one of your major strengths. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Situations you thought you knew inside out will suddenly have exciting new dimensions. It's often like that at this time of year, partly because the planets begin to stimulate your remarkable creative zones. What you've got to do is do what you want, not what other people think you want! CANCER Cancer: Your faith in certain individuals may have been shattered, but someone is standing by you. It's not just practical changes that are important at home, but an entire shift of attitudes. It's time for a spot of domestic clarity! And, by that, I mean openness and honesty. 
LEO, Leo: It's a good moment to make a wish. A good ninety percent of all available celestial factors are cheering you on in one form or another. Probably the best way to tune in to their expectations is via a spot of positive thinking. The fact is that even difficulties can work out to your advantage. 
VIRGO, Virgo: I know what a doormat you can be, and that sometimes you resent the extent to which others walk all over you. Yet, if you are discriminating and capable of making sensible choices, you will be able to separate the deserving causes from those that deserve only to be packed on their way. 
LIBRA, Libra: Everything seems to be working out just fine, although I realise that there may have been a few hairy moments! All that's necessary is that you know when to change and when to stay still. It's all in the timing - and you, of course, have an instinctive knowledge of when to move forward and when to hang back. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Although you may be a little edgy, I don't think you have anything to worry about just now. A great many of you are facing a busy day. At the very least you must work out how to attain a treasured ambition. Surprisingly, someone you live with could be a considerable help. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Normally you're in the driving seat, but now you seem to be a passenger, travelling life's transit system as a passive observer. Stand up for yourself and for your rights as never before, although that might mean that you have to take on new responsibilities. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Patience, tolerance and a sense of humour are the necessary ingredients for a successful day. Perhaps you might like to take someone else's part if they're in difficulties or making heavy weather of an otherwise easy load? A few choice words could help - if you can find the right way to say them. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Relationships on all levels should be more harmonious, contented and affectionate as the major planetary alignments zoom in on delightful regions of your solar chart. Go for all adventurous options, if you have a choice in the matter, that is. 
TAURUS, Taurus: A relative or loved one may appear to need your help. Yet I believe that the real situation is the opposite, and that it is you who could do with a helping hand. Relatives must be encouraged to pamper you. You may have to do a little persuading, though. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Do not make any bold moves concerning your emotional situation until the picture is a little clearer. The fact that current stars are highly romantic can also mean that you are in a muddle. But it's all really to do with not knowing what choices are best for you. Cancer Cancer: The Moon keeps your emotions on the move like so much water swilling around in a bucket. Don't complain if your mood is up one moment and down the next, but appreciate the marvellous variety of emotions which is your special gift. And if you're making your mind up, do it on the basis of the facts. 
LEO, Leo: Your planetary picture is reaching a monthly peak of good fortune this evening. Your only enemy is impatience. Indeed, any difficulties will stem from a spirit of uncontrollable excess. Stay in command, especially of your emotions, and all should be smooth. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Partners are certainly in a mood to throw surprises your way. I doubt if you'll understand all the very many pleasant trends in your life at the moment, or accept that someone is working away on your behalf. But that's only because you tend to think that other people are just feathering their own nests. 
LIBRA, Libra: You seem to have taken on rather too much and the practice may not prove as easy as the theory  but, then, it never does. You're partly saved by the fact that higher powers may come to your rescue, but in return you must maintain the best standards: nothing less will do. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You probably feel as if you're swimming around in a fog, a consequence of the fact that all your thoughts are being filtered through that most misty of planets, Neptune. All the same, I'd like to remind you that you need to keep up a good front at work. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Your foundations are shifting, and everything that takes place does so because your sense of freedom is reviving. Don't read any more into personal situations than is really there. What is happening may be unusual but is for the best. You may be reminded of an old friend or lover abroad, or may decide to fix up a foreign journey. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You are fascinated by all the hidden areas of life, and your interest in mysticism, spirituality or the occult is likely to be stimulated by Mercury's current relationship to those two psychic influences, Neptune and Uranus. On top of which, you have to watch your wallet. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You can have something you want, but only if you accept that its use or value may fade as time passes. On the other hand, if someone gives you something you haven't asked for, do respond graciously. Otherwise they may decide not to help you next time round. 
TAURUS, Finances may be hanging a little too heavily over your head at the moment. If possible, do talk to others about your plans and thoughts for the future. Remember the old saying that a problem shared is usually halved. At least, let's hope that it's not doubled! 
GEMINI, You are definitely in the mood to fight for your rights at the moment. Don't let anyone take you for a ride, but don't be mean, either. Nobody will think the worse of you if you are gullible or easily deceived. The only real risk is that you might feel embarrassed! CANCER You'll need to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground if you're going to face intricate and intensely emotional situations stirred up by that energetic planet Mars in an acutely sensitive zone of your chart. You'll be looking for outlets for your adventurous aspirations. 
LEO, With each day that passes you are coming closer to the solution of a complicated problem. The only question I must ask is whether you are really ready for the answer, and will you recognise the truth when you see it? Perhaps it will be a close partner who notices when the time is right. 
VIRGO, A fluid Moon keeps your emotions to the fore and it's no use sticking to the letter of the law. If I were you, I'd judge each case purely according to the most compassionate and humanitarian considerations. The more you give, then the more you're likely to receive. 
LIBRA, The chimes of freedom are ringing out, but I must remind you of the old cliche that prisoners are often lost without their chains. Are you ready to take that leap into the unknown which is symbolised by this week's remarkable alignments? You've got until next week to make up your mind. 
SCORPIO, While it's true that your stars are generally auspicious, at least in daily terms, weekly indications suggest that you may shoot yourself in the foot. It's strange just how many ways you find to undermine your confidence! Snap out of it, and look after yourself! 
SAGITTARIUS, If you're holding out for a better deal, you must reckon on the fact that people and circumstances over which you have little or no control may dilute your will and set up all sorts of red herrings. What you've got to do is keep your eye on the ball: when it moves, you move! 
CAPRICORN, Someone may ruffle your feathers, but then that's nothing new. What could be different this time, though, is your response. Have you thought, for example, that it may be you who has misunderstood people in authority, such as employers, rather than the other way round? AQUARIUS Old and half-forgotten memories are apt to creep back, and you may be feeling nostalgic. Yet if your thoughts and habits are dominated by the past, you may miss a personal opportunity, perhaps one that has foreign connections or far-sighted implications. 
TAURUS, An emotional storm will have been whipped up before the week is over. Probably everything will revolve around a few silly misunderstandings, and in that case you can put them right yourself. Your ideas are good, even when you're not quite sure of the facts, so test your thoughts out privately before you go public. 
GEMINI, Do keep an eye out for children who may be in difficulties or straying from the straight and narrow. For your own part, do be aware of any sudden desire to throw caution to the wind. You must decide whether you are truly ready for the consequences. If you're not, then hold back. CANCER Are you suffering from divided loyalties? Is someone in the family drawing you in a different direction to the one you've chosen? Look upon this as a rich period in which to come to a new personal understanding. And that includes gaining a fresh perspective on your own hidden desires. 
LEO, Lunar alignments do seem to be so utterly secretive. Rather than keep thoughts and feelings to yourself, why not ask what makes you so very reluctant to reveal certain important hopes. Is it that you think that other people just aren't ready to hear what you have to say? 
VIRGO, Can you afford to make an error of judgment now? I think not. You see, the critical planets are lined up in such a position that, if you take a risk and lose, you will be hit in the wallet. Actually you're in for an extravagant year, which is precisely why you should exert tight controls. 
LIBRA, Even small, minor and trivial events will eventually assume a deep long-term significance. Give current developments time to unfold and wait for the consequences to be resolved before reaching a final judgment. You may have to wait a little longer for the position to be absolutely clear. 
SCORPIO, Telepathy may offer a better means of communication than plain speech, such is the potential for misunderstanding. It may be best to mix with people who are capable of tuning in to your subtle way of doing things. Perhaps you should write things down and see how they look on paper! 
SAGITTARIUS, Socially your current stars really couldn't be better. Don't let considerations of cost come between you and a hoped-for invitation or outing. If you want to make your first billion, then think laterally: the answers to your questions may be right under your nose! 
CAPRICORN, Today is not going to be easy, but it could be useful. What is required of you is a willingness to put yourself in someone else's shoes and a readiness to change your plans. What's more, a valuable new friendship could be born out of current chance encounters. AQUARIUS You want to get your own way, and with the planets so favourably aligned to your sign you probably will. The only qualification is that you must do the donkey-work yourself; nobody else is going to do it for you. One other word though -just because you think you're right, that doesn't mean that you are right! 
TAURUS, Challenging relationships between Mercury and a number of other planets mean that you may be forced to shift your position a little this week. In fact, you may as well give a mile as an inch, and resolve a long-term difficulty while you're about it. 
GEMINI, Everything revolves around your attitudes and opinions. The big question is, are you prepared to be more flexible? If not, you may find that you lose the advantage and perhaps sacrifice a friendship. The last thing you want to do now is drift apart from somebody who has been so special. Also Read | How coronavirus attacks, step by step CANCER Jealousy is not a pleasant emotion, but you do find it far too easy to become envious of others' apparently marvellous situations. Stop for a moment and think about just exactly how much you have going for you. Perhaps, you might discover, they think it's you who has got it made. 
LEO, You may be on tenterhooks as generous Jupiter approaches a fresh relationship with your chart. You're on a long-term cycle of emotional exploration and it's possible that you're already looking forward to an engagement that's not scheduled to take place until next year. 
VIRGO, You can pay a bit more attention than usual to professional qualms and queries. You're bound to feel a little emotional about your place in the world, but nothing will suffice except commonsense and an appreciation of reality. Just because other people have their heads in the clouds, that doesn't mean that you should join them. 
LIBRA, Surprises await. I cannot promise that everything will be easy, but I can assure you that in amongst the thorns, roses will bloom. Be patient and wait until next week for the real magic, though. But, then, at the risk of sounding trite, magic is all around you - all you have to do is look.

SCORPIO, May I remind you that pride is one of the seven deadly sins? I'm pointing this out now because you're currently quite prepared to listen to other people, but I hope you'll remember this piece of advice in about a month's time when you'll be convinced you're number one. 
SAGITTARIUS, You are having to do a tricky juggling act, and it seems as if you have taken on one commitment too many. You must decide what is to go and what is to stay. If you don't make up your mind then the choice may be made for you. And if that happens then you may not be able to influence the outcome. 
CAPRICORN, I know that when events move fast it may all be a little scary, but everything in astrology comes in phases. If you deal well with current tension then you'll be in an ideal position to enjoy relaxed conditions next month. You may also be feeling somewhat more affluent. AQUARIUS As things are starting to go right in one area, you may imagine that they are starting to run off course in another. Perhaps you've been doing something wrong: it's important not to bend the rules at this stage, at least not until you can see the lie of the land. 
TAURUS, I'd like to begin the week with a word about health, for the planets are adopting one of those classic formations which tends to make Taureans feel so terribly under-par. It's very important that you pace yourself, putting your feet up as and when necessary. 
GEMINI, Mercury is still in a critical relationship with a series of planets. We astrologers describe this particular pattern as electrifying, so wait for the sparks to fly — if they're not already doing so. The biggest bone of contention could be money, perhaps because you found yourself holding the bill. Cancer In a sense you are now being offered one last chance. A last chance to do what, you may ask? The straight answer is a chance to complete whatever was begun two or three months ago and is still of very special personal importance. So, whatever's happened in the meantime, get on with it. 
LEO, You may safely leave domestic initiatives until the end of the month without risking your reputation. Today's lunar inclinations are nicely sociable, so a fine time may be had if you mix as widely as possible and remember that everyone has a story to tell. 
VIRGO, Career matters are highlighted today, although whatever happens at work may have strangely emotional overtones. Security seems to be one of the major issues, so don't object if others are a little clingy. After all, you have often relied on them in the past. 
LIBRA, It's all happening. The very special features in your solar horoscope at the moment are provided by the links between planets which rule your inner, private life and those which influence your public aspirations. That's why you might actually be expressing your destiny. 
SCORPIO, You must be aware by now that life is becoming increasingly strange and a little mysterious. A partner may have some good news late in the day, so stick around and give an old opportunity a new chance. Financial details need further consideration, so don't be rushed. 
SAGITTARIUS, The entire financial system is in a state of flux. How far this affects you is another matter, but I believe that you are now in a very strong position to effect a long-term reform in your personal affairs. You'll be able to slip between the cracks and work out your own solutions. 
CAPRICORN, Splendid planetary aspects are waking you from your slumbers. It's all very reminiscent of rising from a troubled dream to discover just how marvellous life really is. Even the odd trauma over the next month may teach you what a wonderful world we live in. AQUARIUS A great deal of this week's celestial activity seems to involve the thought processes. I wouldn't say it was a good time for harmonious discussion and agreement, more for outrageous statements and extreme positions. And then there's the question of your secret fantasies. More about them later. 
TAURUS, You know very well what must be done. Now that Mercury, planet of communication, has turned from an opponent into an ally, you will be far better able to make yourself understood and persuade other people that you are right. 
GEMINI, You will be happier than before to let partners know about certain of your personal plans. Drop your guard and allow people to charm you. Now is the time to trust that friends have your best interests at heart. Cancer If someone has got the better of you in a business matter, there is no need to worry. Not only are your financial prospects looking up but you are now entering the initial phases of a new cycle of hope and optimism. Jupiter, the most beneficial of planets, is about to work its magic again. 
LEO, The current relationship between Jupiter and Mars impacts on that part of your chart associated with health and work. Could it be that you have been pushing yourself too hard lately? Or that you are beginning to feel worn out? Is it time to shed a number of commitments? I think it is. 
VIRGO, One important factor stopping you from making the most of yourself has been a deep fear of taking risks, perhaps a feeling rooted back in the distant past. However, you should by now have overcome such inhibitions and be ready to face the future with renewed optimism. 
LIBRA, Venus continues its challenge to your sign, urging you to take greater notice of partners' needs and wants plus, of course, family members' real desires. There is a great deal of affection coming your way. All you must do is open yourself up to the love and good feeling which other people have for you. 
SCORPIO, It's a strange old week, to be sure. It will take a good deal of courage to swallow your pride and admit that you should change your plans. On the other hand, if you really must continue with your current proposals be certain that close partners are reassured and reconciled. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your fine words and elegant phrases are pouring oil on troubled waters. You have exactly the right touch, especially for getting people at work to buck their ideas up. You may have to knock heads together if that is what it takes. Venus brings excellent romantic developments. 
CAPRICORN, A series of extraordinary events will make the next week somewhat more lively than anticipated. If you are in tune with the mood of the moment you will get both the best out of opportunities and find the most appropriate solution to every problem. It's not a question of right and wrong, but of what works best. AQUARIUS It's time to show your serious face, in the knowledge that if you are careful now you'll be in a much better position to take advantage of various bizarre events that are due to happen very soon. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Venus, your planetary ruler, now casts a rosy glow over home and family affairs. This is a very useful indication indeed, mainly if you're recovering from recent disagreements. More importantly, after today you'll be able to make up your own mind! 
GEMINI, Gemini: It doesn't matter whether you are considering other people's proposals, or making your own. It's not a question of right or wrong, but of realising that once you have made a final decision you must stick with it. Once today has passed, there will be no going back. CANCER Cancer: You have a great deal to learn when it comes to money. There's no doubt about that. That doesn't mean, though, that anyone has the right to take advantage of you. Use this happy time to make a fresh start on a domestic matter or revitalise a family relationship. 
LEO, Leo: Three cheers for mischievous Mercury, which endows you with all your bright ideas. Now is the moment to make up your mind and aim for solid, lasting agreements. You have around seven days to reconsider your plans, in spite of all current distractions! 
VIRGO, Virgo: On a superficial level your chart talks of positive trends around travel, excursions and overseas contacts. The deeper perspective indicates that you have much to learn from tuning into your dreams. Strangely enough, a day-dream might show you the way forward in an unlikely personal goal. 
LIBRA, Libra: Coming events at home will test your bargaining power, not to mention your social skills. The catch? Well, you need partners' support and approval! But how can you get it? Perhaps you could take a little trouble to find out exactly what they want. Listen carefully to every word! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Never again must you allow yourself to be pushed into a corner. For the second day running, the Moon is giving you the chance to mend fences and build bridges. And about time too, you may say! It might be difficult to offer an apology, but the effort should be worth it. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You appear to be searching for something, but what? Any astrologer will tell you that the purpose of your journey through life is not to arrive, but to travel. Now, as ever, you will find that, having reached a goal, it soon ceases to satisfy. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Today's stars are all about love, affection and personal fulfilment. Where and how you will find these is another matter, but you should prepare the way by being completely open to whatever happens, putting aside your prejudices and personal preconceptions. AQUARIUS Aquarius: A great deal of good should come out of recent dramas. At the very least you should now have a much better idea of who your friends are. You may resolve family and domestic problems as soon as you have faced up to awkward issues involving such complicated matters as a possible cash crisis. 
TAURUS, Taurus: What is really needed from you now is a change of attitude. Many of your difficulties or limitations actually exist only in your imagination, and it therefore stands to reason that with a different approach they'd probably disappear. It will help to talk to the right people. 
GEMINI, Gemini: There's a lot going on down at the bottom of your solar chart what with planets jumping this way and that like so many demented chickens. Do yourself a favour and spare a little time for quiet contemplation  that's the way to get things into perspective. CANCER Cancer: It is said that inside every Cancer there is a Capricorn waiting to get out. In other words, inside every muddled, emotional Crab there is a world leader. Yet even without going to extremes it still looks as if you are becoming more of a leader in a very special field with every day that passes. 
LEO, Leo: There is a real danger of cutting off your nose to spite your face. This particularly applies to money matters, but also to a whole range of personal issues. If you're confused, just wait until the dust settles. It may be another couple of weeks before a matter of principle is resolved. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You think you know what you're up to, and what you must do next. However, you could be following a false trail. You may, of course, be absolutely right, but the element of doubt is sufficient for me to advise caution. A loved one is about to turn on the charm, so you have plenty to look forward to! 
LIBRA, Libra: If you think that nothing is as it seems - you could be wrong! Still, the great thing to remember is that friends don't always mean that they say. Keep that simple truth in mind and you'll get the most out of social relationships without being disappointed or disillusioned. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You do dig in your heels so terribly easily. That really is a great shame, for your behaviour totally contradicts the astrological message that everything is in a permanent state of change. Don't imagine, for example, that a current professional situation is in any way permanent. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Try to remember what first drew you to another person, or a group of people. It's always good to focus on what's really important - your friends and loved ones. After all, you don't want to get caught blaming the wrong people for the wrong things! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The Moon is about to let you off the hook, but I'm honestly not sure if that's a good thing. It may do you more good to grapple with contentious issues, including money matters, until the last minute, even if it is too late to substantially alter the final outcome. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The time has come to make loved ones, partners and employers realise that you cannot be taken for granted any longer. Don't press too hard just yet though, for a minority of people you have to deal with are still too self-obsessed to see anything other than their own interests. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You do tend to take on emotional burdens, don't you? If you are falling into the old Taurean trap of accepting life as it is, don't. With a single leap and a mighty bound you could be free of personal pressures which have bothered you for longer than you can remember! 
GEMINI, Gemini: You should now find it really easy to forget about intimate affairs and concentrate on making the grade - and making your mark at work. Your best course of action is to get hold of anyone who will listen and bend their ears for as long as you can! CANCER Cancer: It is pretty certain that you still need to use tact and diplomacy when handling one very special relationship. A romantic involvement is now coming up for its periodic review, and you will have fresh demands to make. See to it that they are realistic ones. 
LEO, Leo: Confidence is a funny thing. First you have it, then you don't. The curious fact at the moment is that you are likely to be confident with your feelings, but not with your ideas. Or is it the other way round? All things considered, the stars aren't sure whether you're coming or going! 
VIRGO, Virgo: Difficult planetary alignments present you with a tough challenge, but I am sure you will rise to it. The problem is how to make a go of joint financial relationships and commitments. Fortunately, helpful planetary aspects are equally spread throughout the day. 
LIBRA, Libra: You could not wish for better social influences, and you'll be putting plenty of extra effort into making relationships work. This doesn't mean that they're easy, though. I think interesting might be a better term, as friends and partners chop and change, in turn making then cancelling arrangements. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: A personal ambition appears to hang in the balance, but eventually you will come out on top. Indeed, you might have already done so, though there seems to be something deep within the Scorpio psyche that stops you recognising when you're well off! Opinion | PB Mehta writes: A lockdown requires a command, an opening will require confidence 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You must continue to exercise due caution and discretion over a joint financial arrangement. If I could just repeat something I've been saying for a few months, it is ethical issues rather than cash balances which seem to be the heart of the matter. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: I've not spoken about professional affairs yet this week, so just let me take you ahead a little and point out that as the days pass your work will suddenly spring into life. Even if you're not in gainful employment, there are other ambitions waiting to achieve lift-off. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Your solar chart is a complex one at the moment. You may say one thing and do another - and then change positions on both counts. Await further developments! But not with baited breath! A cash question makes you think about fundamental issues - such as whether money or friendship is more important to you. READ | Masakali 2.0 song: Somebody please stop Tanishk Bagchi! 
TAURUS, Taurus: Bide your time now and for the next forty-eight hours. You have so much going for you that the last thing you should do is blow it all by revealing someone's secrets or, worst of all, being taken in by gossip. Actually, you could be happiest if you're left alone to do your own thing. Follow live updates on the coronavirus pandemic in India and the world 
GEMINI, Gemini: You are extremely fortunate that you are having a second chance. Basically, you have until the end of this week to reconsider your position and until the middle of next week to do something about it. But both next month and the month after bring a couple of complete U turns - so nothing is written in stone. CANCER Cancer: You have worked too hard, and waited far too long, to be denied your full reward. Can I entreat you to use every bit of your ambitious, courageous character to take a vital step up the Cancerian career ladder - and to lick the opposition at home? 
LEO, Leo: I am quite sure that, in a matter of days, you will be presented with the opportunity to put your own house in order by making whatever improvements you desire. Yesterday's delicate planetary patterns combine with today's more sensitive indications to strengthen your mysterious sixth sense. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You are to be the recipient of good fortune from a hidden or secret source. There's a catch, because if this source is indeed concealed, the consequences may not be known to you for months or even years. Can you wait that long? You must be patient! 
LIBRA, Libra: You must either make some sort of commitment or lose the support and affection of someone who could one day exert a massively beneficial influence on your life, security and happiness. If you are therefore to break a promise, you must do so only after full consultation. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Time and time again, your horoscope comes back to work and professional ambitions, but not for much longer. However, the final curtain call may not be taken for another three weeks, so stay alert until then. In the meantime, try to have more pleasure - whatever you're doing. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: An essential component of your current chart points to the fact that the only truth is spiritual, with a capital T. What you may now achieve is an opportunity to make those who have tried to pull the wool over your eyes realise that you cannot be changed. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Even the prospect of a major upheaval on the personal front should not upset you too much. You're lucky that the general planetary situation is swinging heavily towards relaxation after a period of relatively high tension. You'll have more time to put your feet up. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Today's lunar alignments bring positive personal indications for Aquarians, and I would expect you to turn even unpromising conditions to your advantage. Family life could also be fairly relaxed, at least for some of the time. Plus, you can get your own way more often than not. 
TAURUS, Taurus: This does not have to be a week of discord, disagreements and conflict, but that's just what it could be if you succumb to frustration and impatience. As you know, it's much better to give people a second chance, especially at home. Why not follow your own advice? 
GEMINI, Gemini: The main Geminian danger lies in trying to be too clever. The planetary signs strongly advise you to learn the lessons of the past! Look again at advice from people you know and trust. You might not have taken any notice so far, but now could be a good time to make up for that! CANCER Cancer: Domestic discussions should be pursued with great vigour. Being diplomatic and considerate is quite compatible with standing up for your rights. It's just a question of arranging all your points in order before you open your mouth, and getting partners to listen. 
LEO, Leo: In many ways it's a favourable day, but it all depends how you handle today's generally loose, laid-back and highly individualistic circumstances. You'll do best to stick to your principles, but there doesn't seem to be any real reason why you can't be infinitely flexible when it comes to the details. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Try not to invite trouble or discord by saying anything in haste or in anger. The plain fact is that the nicer you are to other people, the more pleasant they'll be to you. Simple, isn't it? Plus, you may have forgotten a number of important facts. You might even have lost a vital piece of paper! READ | Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth and Priyanka Chopra starrer Family is all about self-isolation 
LIBRA, Libra: You ought soon to be free from a lot of unnecessary pressure, and also from unwanted commitments. You are therefore ready to take the path of universal love, a concept which I know is treated with some scepticism in certain circles! Still, that's no reason for you to be cynical. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Even those people with whom you have had profitable dealings in the past are now likely to use unorthodox methods in a vain attempt to gain the upper hand. Don't worry: they're suffering from a bad bout of over-confidence, and they'll be brought back down to earth soon. READ | Will summer heat kill COVID19 virus? Some trends, but experts still advise caution 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The overwhelming emphasis is still on travel plans, which today look optimistic, enthusiastic and confident. Such stars always carry with them a warning to consciously check all details, especially regarding legal queries. By the way, you may be embarking on a journey of the spirit or the mind. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: In many respects it's a Capricornian moment, a time to slow down and make sure your life is resting on firm foundations. There's still a lot of life in the old goat yet and now is also the time to revive long-term dreams with a view to completion next year. AQUARIUS Aquarius: For someone who is supposed to leap before they look, you have certainly been changing your spots, becoming more cautious by the hour. Perhaps it's because you realise that your choices will only work if you anticipate the possible practical problems. You may appreciate partners' many little tempting blandishments, but don't let them pull you off course. READ | Coronavirus: States in no hurry to ease lockdown 
TAURUS, You seem to have been knocked off balance, perhaps by someone who no longer understands your best interests. However, over the next few days you may pull yourself together and assert yourself even more than in the past. You can expect dramatic improvements by the end of the week. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus pandemic 
GEMINI, Group events promise to be more satisfying than one-to-one meetings. Perhaps that is because you wish to avoid the complications that may arise out of intimate encounters. Money developments may be off the agenda until the end of the week, when the Moon begins a new role in your financial life. Cancer Your best days should be Thursday and Friday, when the Moon, the planet responsible for your emotions, passes through a sympathetic region of your chart. Even better, other people will genuinely understand your hopes and needs, which should make you feel happier and more confident. 
LEO, Professional Leos have most to gain from the Sun's current motion. All of you with grand ambitions will experience some sort of difficulty, mainly a clash between short-term domestic responsibilities and long-term hopes. But what is important is that you develop your creative talents, rather than blindly submitting to a routine imposed from outside. 
VIRGO, Misunderstandings are likely around the time of the Solar alignments in the middle of the week. Have you by any chance considered making more of an effort to explain yourself? If not, do so now! Also, please see to it that all travel plans are set out clearly and without ambivalence or ambiguity. 
LIBRA, You'll have a little support from the Moon at the beginning of the week, which is a sure sign that you'll feel good about your home situation. Yet a financial crisis, hopefully a brief one, is bound to flare up on Wednesday or Thursday, when the Sun and Pluto get into top gear. 
SCORPIO, This is no time for weak-kneed compromise. Instead, you must be tough and unyielding, as only a Scorpio can. You will gain an enormous amount of satisfaction from pursuing your own goals, so don't feel guilty about being selfish. Fascinating news may arrive at the end of the week — so that should stir things up. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a week for plots, rumours and gossip. You'll also discover increased opportunities for spreading a little goodwill, helping people worse off than you and generally adopting a charitable outlook. You should be liberated from a tight financial corner by the end of the week. 
CAPRICORN, The Sun continues to help you, which is surely good news. Take a closer look at a number of your engagements, especially social responsibilities and see if there are any that can be safely abandoned. Do what you can to create the right conditions for a more carefree existence. AQUARIUS The emphasis on close partnerships is still very strong, although it looks as if you'll be communicating at a distance, via letters and telephones, rather than through personal meetings. The one percent of you who have fax machines will be receiving strange messages. 
TAURUS, The heat has definitely been on lately, and only the most obstinate and stubborn Taureans have turned down certain dramatic blandishments. The best planetary influences relate to money, but your judgment will have to be nothing less than perfect! Now, there's a tall order! 
GEMINI, You are going to enjoy yourself more and more with every day that passes. But first there are certain hurdles to overcome, and these are probably more to do with self-knowledge than with actual events. In other words, if you know what you need, then you'll get what you want. CANCER There's no reason to push yourself too hard for no purpose. Time is on your side mainly because you're only a part of the way through an enlightened ten-year cycle. Therefore, when other people have done their worst and given their best, you will still have more to offer.

LEO, As the weeks go by, you will come to realise that a good friend was perhaps not all they seemed. Hidden depths should be the order of the day, so you may sit back and let your imagination be your guide. If you do a favour for someone now, I am sure it will be repaid ten-fold. 
VIRGO, There are extraordinarily powerful pressures to change, even when you don't want to. While aggravation at home may be a very powerful factor, those of you who have been experiencing professional pressures could suddenly realise that you can't go on as before. 
LIBRA, The way forward is not always as clear as you'd like. Although it may sound slightly impractical, your best course of action may be to go for whichever option seems to be the most adventurous. Keep a weather-eye on delicate legal issues though, as you don't want disagreements at this stage. 
SCORPIO, Of all the signs of the zodiac, yours is about to come closer to discovering the truth than any other. My best advice now is to stay cool and not be easily offended or dismayed. A last-minute financial rush may be good for you. Just for once, an instant decision might be the best.

SAGITTARIUS, You've done well. Nobody can deny that. Having stuck to your guns and made others realise just how tough you can be, you must now sit back and listen to them. Now is the worst time to imagine you can wind anybody up, or otherwise belittle their interests. 
CAPRICORN, What takes place now could be the climax of months of effort. Work seems to be the key to a successful day, but that doesn't necessarily mean paid employment. Just make sure that, by the end of the day, there are as few outstanding unfinished chores as possible. AQUARIUS The past few months seem to have coincided with better personal relationships. Other people have been giving you fewer problems, and you seem to have become more confident. Today you may find time to relax and enjoy the fruits of your many emotional labours. Read | Political row later, Centre climbs down on J&amp;K order, reserves all jobs for UT domiciles 
TAURUS, The next forty-eight hours should raise the financial temperature. Do concentrate on your own interests, in spite of the fact the others may have their own rather complex demands. Partners could still be rather fractious, and a loved one may need placating. 
GEMINI, The Moon is now offering you a great deal of encouragement and you may right wrongs, make up for injustices and generally correct a serious personal imbalance. Don't imagine that you can get away with half-measures, though. It's time to go the whole way. CANCER Make the fullest possible advantage of a series of splendid planetary aspects. Probably the prime consideration is to see that you take a little time off by yourself. Also, please don't believe unfounded rumours or imagine that others are undermining you.

LEO, You've got more personal choices coming up. The question is whether you would rather spend time with friends who may be pleasant but dull, or with intimate partners who may be highly stimulating but also rather complicated and unpredictable. 
VIRGO, If you have not already had some sort of completely random and ill-considered argument, whether with a close partner or a complete stranger, it may yet happen. Mind you, sometimes it does you good to blow your top! It's just that you have to clear up the mess afterwards! 
LIBRA, What comes to light over the next few days should strengthen your bargaining power. You should check out any legal, ethical or long-term issues today, so that when an opportunity does come along, you are well primed - and can do your best by other people. Read | National death count from Tabligh meeting now 15 — and almost a fifth of total cases 
SCORPIO, You do have a sense of humour, even if some people don't believe it! The moment has come for you to lead others a merry dance - which is just what they deserve. Do keep a very careful eye on the financial situation, partly because a partner is liable to take up a rather extreme position. 
SAGITTARIUS, Now that one series of intensely personal planetary aspects is on the wane, you should begin to feel slightly less hassled. Yet don't expect genuine relaxation until after another few days have passed. Actually, you're most relaxed when you're busy! 
CAPRICORN, You should spend a little time tuning your body up, with special attention to exercise and diet. You are slightly sensitive at the moment, and any emotional stress could leave you feeling under the weather. That's why partners should be nice to you! I know it, and you know it, but I hope they know it! AQUARIUS You may leave yourself enough time for a spot of self-indulgence, but should realise that certain planets are tipping you into excess. That would never do! Remember the dangers of swinging to emotional extremes or of putting too many demands on partners. 
TAURUS, You may be tempted to try your luck, but the fact is that gamblers usually lose. This is why the same planetary factors that urge you to take a risk, also urge you to double-check all details. If you are determined to go ahead, it may be possible to arrange some sort of fall-back position. Follow live updates on the coronavirus outbreak in India 
GEMINI, Increasingly, this is a time for a spot of raw ambition. What do you really want do to? Who do you really want to be with? Once you have this little lot figured out you can begin to make your dreams come true. You might even emerge much wiser, if a little bruised! CANCER The reason for colleagues' off-hand behaviour and partners' unsympathetic attitudes is not that they are uncaring. Rather, you should realise that they may be suffering from the weight of their own emotional burdens, and unable to pay full attention to yours. 
LEO, According to astrologers, each manifestation of life contains the seeds of its exact opposite. This was never more true than today, so whatever extremes of feeling or experience you hit, realise that things could change at any moment. Every problem presents you with a new opportunity. 
VIRGO, Today's most interesting planetary aspect could have an influence that far outweighs anything that happens this week, propelling you into fighting for your beliefs and principles. Do not shirk your duty, but stand up for what you know to be right. 
LIBRA, Planetary conditions are turbulent, indicating upsets in your psychological 'weather'. The best way in which you can help yourself is to disengage from whatever source of controversy is bothering you and take the long-term view. Also, remember that other people might just be right! 
SCORPIO, Warning signals continue in the financial sectors of your solar chart, so you must maintain a proper sense of decorum when it comes to questions of cash. You are better off than most people at the moment, in the sense that they will be more dependent on you than you on them. 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything seems to hinge around your need for status and prestige. The problem is that such things have to be earned through consistent and long-term effort, whereas now you do seem to be in danger of risking a few short cuts. If you leave out the difficult bits, then it's unlikely that you'll make the most of the easy bits! 
CAPRICORN, One important factor in your chart, I haven't mentioned so far this week, concerns overseas travel, and a certain adventurous streak in your personality which could see you wandering to a far corner of the globe, or at least developing adventurous elements in your daily life. AQUARIUS All your instincts and hunches should prove correct, but that's not a great deal of use if other people refuse to listen or take any notice. In social engagements, go for change and excitement: you could be attracted to people who like to take risks. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Today's celestial schedule is crammed with planetary alignments that are bound to keep the emotional situation moving along at a cracking pace. You may expect, indeed welcome, changes in mood. Also don't hide from feelings you cannot face. Meet them head-on and they might just disappear. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Not until after another few days have passed will you be entirely clear about what should, or must, be done. If you wish, you may prevaricate until next week, hopeful that other people will share the prevailing sense of indecision and uncertainty. CANCER Cancer: Concentrate on activities which can be accomplished in harmony with other people, and realise that it may not be wise to fight crusades at work. The moment you start speaking your mind, it may become clear that you have forgotten what you were talking about! 
LEO, Leo: In spite of a wave of optimism, which is inclined to appear without warning and sweep all before it, this is a very dodgy moment to take risks. Your planets are casual and reckless, which means that you must therefore take very great pains to make sure that everything works out as planned. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Powerful, challenging circumstances are urging you to become very much more outspoken, outgoing and self-confident. Proceed with optimism, but at the first hint of complacency or carelessness, everything will unravel. That's why you've got to keep awake and stay alert. READ | April Fool's Day 2020: Wishes Images, Quotes, Funny Jokes, Messages and Whatsapp status 
LIBRA, Libra: Sometimes, you do one thing and the universe does another. As fast as you try and keep things as you want them, others will undo your handiwork. A helpful perspective on the mid-week's mixture of good and bad humour, is that everyone will get what they want at least some of the time! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It's partly because some stunning planetary aspects now relate to financial matters that you should take such care. It's exactly at times like these that carelessness with resources and personal possessions can be expensive. After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Try to remember that with Mars now exerting its powerful presence, you may be exhibiting an irrepressible urge to become number one. There are indeed amazing chances of success, but, if at any time it seems that the tide is going against you, don't force the pace. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: For all your confidence, self-determination and fighting spirit, it is clear that you cannot fight battles on your own behalf. There is an almost compulsory idealism around at the moment which means that you have no choice but to put others first. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You'll find opportunities in the midst of adversity. The principle group of planets now affords you a marvellous opportunity to have your cake and eat it, probably several times over! Just make sure that everyone else is too preoccupied with their own little affairs to notice. Explained: Rate of COVID-19 spread in India, world 
TAURUS, If brand new involvements or associations are to flourish as you hope, everything must be above board from the word go. It is only fair to point out that if a partner does practise a little deception, it will only be because they wish for the best. 
GEMINI, Personal trouble will only arise now if you allow partners to feel left out, taken for granted or otherwise unfairly neglected. If that is indeed the case, you will have to make amends sooner rather than later. If an apology is called for, then summon up all your courage and offer it. CANCER Good, solid social influences indicate that ordinary, friendly meetings will be very much more pleasant than potentially explosive, passionate encounters. If you ask for total commitment from a partner at any time over the next ten days, you may get more than you bargained for. 
LEO, You tend to divulge only what you want others to hear, and this might be a very wise policy at home. For the next two weeks, it is almost impossible to predict how partners will react. You'll be walking on egg-shells part of the time, so tread lightly. 
VIRGO, Although you are right to make as much effort as you do to please those you care for, it is fair of you to expect them to return the favour. Hopefully a family member, or someone you've been living with, will reconsider their previously unhelpful response. 
LIBRA, If you want to have a peaceful existence, then please stop making so many mountains out of so few molehills. To be perfectly plain, it is about time you stopped worrying about other people making a mess of their lives, and started trusting them instead. 
SCORPIO, You should continue to stick out for what you know to be right and just. Also, be sure that with the Moon sailing through sensible regions of your chart, other people will be on your case, so no ducking out at the last minute. If you do let someone else down, do it gently. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's true to say that in a matter of weeks you will forget that you were ever racked by indecision, or that you were pulled in so many directions at once that you thought you were going to explode. However, you can expect to change your mind one more time. 
CAPRICORN, Your discreet Capricornian imagination should now be on show. If it's entertainment you're after, a spot of culture should go down well, and if routine work dominates your day, bring a little of your creative passion to bear: partners will appreciate it. AQUARIUS The full significance of a social invitation, or even of an accusation, is not yet clear. This is hardly your fault, so don't let others blame you just because they couldn't organise a decent get-together. They have to take responsibility for their own actions - or lack of action. 
TAURUS, There does seem to be some cause for discretion today, although exactly why, is not clear. If, on the other hand, you do decide to come clean, all the indications are that you'll receive a fair hearing. That, at least, has to be some consolation! 
GEMINI, If you have been a mite frustrated or muddled as a result of partners' failure to see what was staring them in the face, you may hope that events will now take a turn for the better. Within a few days someone will claim that they knew what you were talking about all along! CANCER The Moon's influence on the uppermost reaches of your solar chart should remind you that you were born under one of the so-called 'cardinal' signs, and that, as this suggests, you were born to lead, not to follow. But, if you want other people to do what they're told, you'd better be pleasant to them. 
LEO, Although you are likely to receive some help and assistance today, when other people start lending a hand they may begin to take over. This is why you should first always double-check their apparently good advice. The last thing you want to do is move over while they make a mess of things! 
VIRGO, You need to know where to draw the line. Only if you take a much firmer stand now will other people respect you. As Mars approaches another relationship with your chart, partners will increasingly be demanding that you do things their way - and the pressure may be hard to resist. 
LIBRA, The key to contentment lies in your ability to get on with people with whom you are increasingly being forced into very close contact. This advice, by the way, can include people you work with as much as people you live with. Don't wait until they see eye-to-eye with you. 
SCORPIO, Over the next two weeks you will show an increasing tendency to look on the bright side of life and, if you continue to believe that others are certain to help you on your way, they probably will do just that! Some prophecies are self-fulfilling, which is why optimism breeds success. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mercury and Mars' intelligent alignments indicate that, where you have gone ahead without consent, you must now reach a retrospective agreement. It is no use just pretending that other people have no right to be consulted. You've got to keep them in the picture. 
CAPRICORN, If there's one thing that's certain, it's that nothing is certain! The Sun is but a short distance away from its passage into a whole new sector of your chart. This is why you may consider the virtues of keeping certain plans to yourself, perhaps even for another few months. AQUARIUS Superficially it looks like decision time, but no matter how hard others try to persuade you to make up your mind, it seems unlikely that any firm choices will be taken. Neither should they be. There is still more information to come along, so be patient. 
TAURUS, The plain fact that Venus is in a supportive aspect to your sign makes it inevitable that there is work to be done in relationships. If you cope with whatever friends and loved ones place in your path, this is a sign that your attitude is sufficiently mature for you to move to a deeper level of emotional involvement. 
GEMINI, The steady passage of planets through the friendly and sympathetic regions of your chart always favours your interests. It is time for you to break through the chains which tie you to a particular set of commit-ments, and launch yourself on a new track. Make sure that you carry loved ones with you. Cancer Partners and loved ones need to be handled with velvet gloves, perhaps because people seem to be totting up the cost of emotional entanglements. The problem is not that their difficulties are necessarily greater than usual, rather that they imagine the worst. So, what you can do? For a start, how about offering some reassurance? 
LEO, Social stars are upping their game in your chart. The present time is likely to be challenging and emotionally trying at home. This does not mean, though, that you will be experiencing unpleasant events. Rather, you may be stimulated and excited by the need to relate to new people and respond to high expectations. 
VIRGO, There is a marvellous connection between planets aligned with financial sectors and those aspecting professional regions. The meaning is quite simple: hard work and extra effort will be rapidly rewarded with increased earnings. This knowledge should be sufficient to stir you on to further achievements. 
LIBRA, Everything depends on your attitude to life. Are you one of those Librans who insists on being a martyr and a victim? Or are you prepared to face life head-on, meeting challenges with all guns blazing? If you fall into the latter group then the future is bright indeed. So, remember just how much you have going for you and meet the world face-to-face. 
SCORPIO, The approaching relationship between Venus, the planet of love, and Pluto, the obsessive ruler of your unconscious desires, means that a once perfect emotional partnership may be up for renewal. It is a rule of astrology that all endings are accompanied by new beginnings — and already you should be aware that there'll soon be a bright new dawn. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you're thinking of pressing ahead with a number of general ambitions that are not specifically related to your emotional desires or professional cares, these are still early days. Nevertheless, you are embarking on a new cycle of experience and can afford to make a fresh start in a number of areas. 
CAPRICORN, Do not concern yourself unduly with personal matters and relationships: partners are in a strong position and are quite capable of looking after themselves as well as offering you a reasonable degree of support and assistance. It is professional ambitions which must now occupy your attention. AQUARIUS You are likely to feel rather tired and jaded. Perhaps you will also be concerned that someone has already, or is about to, let you down. Such feelings are perfectly natural, now that your astrological cycles are entering a quiet phase, and indicate that you need to slow down and take a brief rest. 
TAURUS, Do you really wish partners to dance to your tune? You must be aware that, if they do so, they may become dependent on you and even impose certain unwelcome expectations on you in the future. Perhaps you are still not ready for such an increase in responsibility. If not, then you have to find a way to explain yourself. 
GEMINI, As so often happens these days, planetary pressures were stronger during the week than at the weekend. This is precisely why you must not allow yourself to be bullied or bamboozled today. Next week is an ideal moment for getting new enterprises and initiatives going, so wait a few days. Cancer Strong influences on imaginative regions of your chart draw your attention to the benefits of travel and the maintenance of overseas contacts. You have every reason to take advantage of all opportunities to get away from home. There's nothing wrong with making an escape! 
LEO, Something seems to be drawing you towards a deeper influence in dubious financial activities. Please do not do anything you will later regret, and don't allow yourself to be swayed by over-optimistic friends. What seems to be most likely is that somebody who has let you down will repent. 
VIRGO, Domestic affairs may consume too much of your time. However, if you pay careful attention to various comings and goings, you may rearrange family plans to suit your own feelings and interests. Intimate relationships will benefit from a dose of your good, old-fashioned commonsense. 
LIBRA, A number of planets are bringing lively and interesting conditions, and there's a definite chance that a new activity might lead to a serious opportunity later. Do not be slow to put your ideas forward, because it looks as if there may be some cash rewards. 
SCORPIO, If you're in a restless mood, it is time to think about travel plans. Only you know how much stimulation you gain from improvements in your environment and exposure to different cultures. And, also, you should get family finances in order without delay. 
SAGITTARIUS, Planetary movements look encouraging, although there seems to be little to stimulate you. This is one of those days when you must rely on your own motivation and make your own entertainment. If you're looking for a financial bonus, then check out a family connection. 
CAPRICORN, A flash of inspiration may show the way out of a legal or bureaucratic morass, you'll be pleased to hear. However, in the event of a misunderstanding you must be prepared to give a partner the benefit of the doubt. They have done wrong, but they need your understanding. AQUARIUS If you've been concentrating on career issues, try taking stock today. The success of a particular partnership is a very important consideration, perhaps more so than financial rewards. In love, it's companionship that counts, and your partner should be your best friend. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You may still be in a bullish mood, buoyed up by the influence of aggressive Mars. It is good to be sure of your ground, yet nobody would advise you to be so confident that you overlook or ignore certain essential details. One word of warning, though - you could be throwing good money after bad. Read | No community transmission yet, rate of spike in positive cases slowing: Govt 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mercury is in such a supportive position that you may be sure that bad feeling will be avoided even if partners are still being frustratingly obtuse. Continue to press for firm agreement. The sooner you get partners committed and tied down, the better. Read | With no water in this slum near South Delhi's Mahipalpur, residents ask: How do we wash our hands? CANCER Cancer: All that has happened in the past will pale into insignificance beside the immense and profound changes which will be sweeping you before them later on. You are now entering a period of personal transformation which is going to find you discovering talents you never dreamt existed. 
LEO, Leo: The first few steps in a new friendship are often hesitant, even for you. However, people who come into your life now must be cultivated, for they will prove to be valuable allies in times to come. Even if you imagine that someone you meet is a rival, you may be mistaken. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Much has been written about the creative potential of this particular phase, not all of which has yet made sense. Today's planetary picture crystallises a number of very subtle trends, pointing you to a life that is both more satisfying and productive. 
LIBRA, Libra: You must pay more attention to working partnerships for the simple reason that colleagues hold the key to your future. You may already have found that fresh light has been shed on formerly confused circumstances. Such clarity is most welcome, as I'm sure you'll agree. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The Sun, Mercury and Venus have come to your assistance, lightening your load and relieving you of pressing domestic questions. It is looking increasingly likely that you will be saved by the prompt action of a friend, perhaps someone you have ignored. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: There are complications in the air. Although you may have to resign yourself to a continuing mystery, you have a choice as to whether to devote your time to work or family issues. Possibly the latter will be more enjoyable although the former may be more necessary. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: As you have realised, there is little that you can do if you don't have the necessary funds. Joint financial affairs must now be settled, and deals must be signed and sealed. Otherwise you may find that you have run out of time, and that partners may decide to stand up for themselves. AQUARIUS Aquarius: This is an intense period for those in the property market. Positive trends and obstacles compete for your attention, but after everything has been taken into consideration you may seem to be running on the spot. Perhaps you should just slow down and take a rest. 
TAURUS, Taurus: There are a number of planetary patterns that will be important if you are to keep your spirits aloft, so there seems to be little point in making life more difficult than need be. Give yourself an easy ride and you'll learn valuable lessons about how to manage your personal affairs in the future. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The fact is that partners or associates may be unwilling to part with the certain information or let you in on a secret. There is no need to feel threatened, though, as all will become clear before long. I know you're impatient, but events are moving faster than they sometimes seem. Cancer Cancer: Recent unexpected developments at work have done little to damage your confidence. In fact you will soon be riding on the crest of a wave, buoyed up by respect and praise from your peers. Everything depends on your sense of timing over the next week. 
LEO, Leo: Take what is on offer and be grateful that the bad feeling of recent days finally seems to be coming to an end. You have every right to expect an explanation of recent behavior even though none may be forthcoming. What I mean is that a partner should apologize, but whether they do is an entirely different matter. 
VIRGO, Virgo: The moment has come to take expert advice on a bureaucratic, legal or business matter. What you want to do now is consolidate all that you have worked so hard to achieve. You've got a difficult task - to set yourself free from one commitment while hanging on to another. 
LIBRA, Libra: There have been times when you would have been quite justified in making a song and dance but, right now, you may do better to turn the other cheek. After all, you are not entirely blameless; the present is the sum total of all your past actions. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You seem to have been caught in the crossfire recently and may have begun to doubt the sense of a number of current endeavors. However, some of the criticism you have been subjected to have been misplaced and unfair - but that doesn't make it any less hurtful. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Imminent planetary movements raise the need to settle matrimonial or partnership affairs sooner rather than later. What took place earlier may have hurt your pride, but should not prevent you from offering an olive branch, now. You'll get all the credit for restoring goodwill. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You have perfectly valid reasons to take a step back and concentrate on conserving your energies. There will be time enough over the coming months for pushing yourself to the limit and achieving your many ambitions. Just for now, take a look at your spiritual values. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Ensure that a partner or relation can't take the wind out of your sails today. You can be certain that you have honored all your commitments and fulfilled your obligations. However, a pressing financial problem may still require urgent attention - there's a problem to patch up. 
TAURUS, Your main concern must be to establish stronger ties with energetic people, especially those younger or less experienced than you. You have sufficient wisdom to see yourself as a teacher in the broadest sense of the word, passing on your wisdom to people who have never come close to the events you have encountered.

GEMINI, There is almost certain to be a major confrontation over career matters, but the saddest part of the whole sorry incident may be that someone you trusted appears to have let you down. Forgive and forget would seem to be the best answer. It's certainly the most noble way out of a current impasse. Cancer The fact that other people may be behaving badly doesn't give you the excuse to do the same. You have a reputation to maintain and, to this end, you may keep silent when, all around you, people are discrediting themselves. Your discretion will reflect well on you. 
LEO, It is time to cut away dead wood and avoid any suspicion that you are hanging on to attitudes or behaviour patterns that have been brought into disrepute. Bear in mind that this is a generally positive phase. Also remember that good fortune is what you make it. 
VIRGO, It's not simply a question of forcing others to move aside, you must demonstrate to one and all that you are both capable of taking control and of securing benefits for everyone, regardless of existing circumstances. Really, you're bigger and better than you think. 
LIBRA, Recent planetary influences have been stimulating, there's no doubt about that. However, the consequences may have been costly, and you're left to pick up the pieces. Do so with your usual skill. I know it's tiring to have to cope with other people's mess, but that's what you're good at. 
SCORPIO, Your judgement is generally accurate but, to be fair, there is no way that you can predict exactly how partners will respond to your plans. However, you would do well to steel yourself to match their ingenuity and determination. In love, follow a cautious path. And don't take anyone for granted. 
SAGITTARIUS, It may take a while for the dust to settle and for you to get back on friendly terms with one or two colleagues and associates. You must be true to your nature and adopt a long-term point of view. If you get your hopes and desires in some sort of order then your behaviour will become more logical. 
CAPRICORN, Where to go from here in your personal plans? A temporary delay may be the answer, although you must be clear in your mind that whatever happens now is bound to have a profound effect. You are at the beginning of a whole new phase of existence. But how and what will not be clear until next month. AQUARIUS Seldom have you experienced a like period when partners or colleagues can offer you such help and assistance. Take heart from the fact that adverse influences are now waning and the prospect that people will once again appreciate your rare, even unique human gifts, is growing. 
TAURUS, Your advice for the day is to take adventurous options and watch out for legal complications. It may be too early to try and buy your way out of a complex emotional situation. You would be better off making a stand on principles that you know to be right, and going it alone if necessary. 
GEMINI, Something will come to the boil today. What or when is difficult to say, but it does seem certain that the air must be cleared, and that this may mean speaking, and accepting, a few home truths. The more honest you are with yourself, the more successful you'll be in an appeal to a partner. Cancer In partnerships of all kinds, from the most intimate to the most public, today represents a profound turning-point. Someone who has come to feel that you owe them a debt may demand that you come up trumps. However, such pressures are not only unfair, they are likely to lead to a serious rift. 
LEO, The fact is that different times bring different possibilities, and right now the trends are highly argumentative. Do not be put out if friends blame you for past misdemeanours that you thought were long dead and buried. Try to understand why they feel as they do. 
VIRGO, What is said or implied today may upset your best-laid plans, yet with your organisational skills it seems that nothing can dent your ego. Your confidence is justified in view of your broad experience. At home, let children take the lead. At work, concentrate on developing your own unique skills. 
LIBRA, The domestic situation will be in a state of flux, and that could be an understatement. Do not let up your efforts to get financial affairs in order, even if it seems that the pressure has relaxed. The moment you loosen your grip, partners will be able to accuse you of letting them, and yourself, down. 
SCORPIO, You may stand the risk of feeling, or being made to feel, like an outsider in your own home. Such accusations are unfair, but may be rooted in the very real attempts you have made to shift domestic responsibility on to other shoulders. You might think that partners have to put in their fair share, but they don't. 
SAGITTARIUS, Adverse planetary aspects almost guarantee that misunderstandings will occur. Look upon this as a time when the stars are challenging you to communicate more clearly and lose no opportunity to say what really needs to be said. But whatever you say, say it with compassion. 
CAPRICORN, Your horoscope has seldom held out a greater promise of change, including change for the better. No matter how hurt, angry or dismayed you feel, or if you seem to be swept by forces beyond your control, this a period of your life to treasure. Please do nothing that may diminish you in others' eyes. AQUARIUS What is revealed now may make you think that a close partner or colleague is really on your side — and could soon fulfil an obligation. Yet you really must keep your feelings in check, for it is certain that you are not yet in possession of the whole, complex story. 
TAURUS, Taurus: There may soon have to be a substantial alteration in your personal life, one which could well have repercussions in your professional or related activities. Don't think of yourself as a martyr or victim, though. It's time to stand up and be counted! Also read | Janata Curfew: A billion plus hunker down 
GEMINI, Gemini: A general abundance of challenging aspects may let you off the hook as far as at least one interesting matter is concerned, yet the atmosphere will be tense and I would be surprised if you escaped without at least one minor confrontation. Still, you might even come out on top. CANCER Cancer: You may have become accustomed to soothing words, especially where long-term financial commitments are concerned. Happily, Mercury's witty performance must have now made you realise that it is better to talk about all those personal differences than ignore them. 
LEO,Leo: It is not part of your nature to suffer fools gladly or to watch partners making silly mistakes. However, an examination of the current situation should make it clear that others must be allowed to go their own way. You might even want to lend a hand! Also read | ‘Now that lockdown has been announced, challenge is to trace COVID-19 patients' 
VIRGO, Virgo: This is no time for self-doubt or second thoughts about new plans or projects at work. You must press ahead, arranging meetings and discussions until you receive the assurances you need. And, if you are concerned about the outcome, make sure that partners understand your predicament. 
LIBRA, Libra:Look on the bright side. Financial obligations have caused a certain amount of heart-searching although, when all is said and done, it's difficult to see that you could have acted other than you did. You will not make the same mistake twice. At least, not in exactly the same way! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It is well worth reminding you that the main difficulty now lies in your failure to let go of the past. It is by refusing to face up to the present that you allow opportunities to slip by - and so let yourself down. If you tackle all those old regrets and resentments, you will soon be much happier.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You are reaching a turning point in your financial situation. What is really at issue, though, is a number of your priorities - and the completely irrational values you put on various people and objects. Have you misjudged somebody? If so, make amends now. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There is nothing to be gained from suppressing your dreams and adopting a crude materialistic approach. You must have faith in your imagination plus the courage to follow your intuitions, even when this means putting yourself out on a limb. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You may think you are good with money, but you must now endeavour to be more selective in your choice of business companions. Sensitive friends and family members may encourage you to be too influenced by first, and perhaps misleading, impressions. Explained: Stage by stage in a pandemic 
TAURUS, You could be heading for an intense confrontation. You will have to speak the plain truth, although please pick your words with care and kindness. Hopefully your candour and sensitivity will be appreciated, and will help everyone move on. Also Read | Covid-19: PM Modi urges calm as migrants leave cities for home 
GEMINI, Something may happen behind the scenes to change your plans and ideas. Whatever takes place will almost certainly involve your work or whatever other routine chores are pre-occupying you at the moment. Romantic hopes are reinforced by Venus' passage through complementary quarters of your chart. Cancer You'll be on the look-out for new friends and anxious to put former associates in their place. Additional attention is required to all travel and holiday plans over the coming weeks, perhaps because you're showing a tendency to forget essential facts. 
LEO, These should be the perfect days to apply a little of your cheery Leonine medicine to a close partnership. Only you can do this, so why don't you organise a break from domestic routine and plan something special instead? After all, everyone needs cheering up, including you.

VIRGO, Legal matters seem to have some role to play in your life over the next weeks. Is it possible that you have embroiled yourself in a bureaucratic muddle? One thing is certain, and that is if you stick to your guns and do what you know to be right, you won't go far wrong. And you might also win some additional respect from the people who matter. 
LIBRA, Shopping, saving and investments all occupy your attention. Money matters can only increase in importance as the week passes. You will come to realise that you have the chance to set your finances on an altogether more prosperous course but how and when are questions that are still unclear. 
SCORPIO, It may be more difficult than usual for you to imagine that a close partner can possibly be right, so deep is your belief in your own infallibility. However, any astrologer would advise you to compromise and bend to circumstances. In short, please be super-flexible.

SAGITTARIUS, Many freedom-loving Sagittarians are now starting to resemble determined, obstinate and emotional Scorpios. Your behaviour, especially a tendency to secrecy in important matters, is departing further from what they have been in the past. 
CAPRICORN, As the days go by you will see that money lies at the root of all disagreements. If you can increase your earnings, as you deserve to do, you will solve a good many of your problems. AQUARIUS Recent developments in your chart associated with relations, children and romance seem bound to work out for the best in the long run, even if you have been rather disconcerted by a number of statements or events. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Your romantic stars are strong, and you are inclined to group a number of feelings under the general heading of 'being in love', but you may not be right. You have other desires which must now be met, such as the need for material security and emotional certainty. Also Read | Testing extended to all pneumonia cases: Govt 
GEMINI, Gemini: Circumstances beyond your control now require improvements at home. The pressure to move to somewhere more spacious or luxurious will soon be intense, much of it coming from your personal irritation with close partners. However, if you take the necessary decisions then other people's opinions and actions will cease bothering you. CANCER Cancer: The legacy of the past, perhaps only of recent days, may be keeping you busy. The warning not to overdo it stands, but nobody can question the amount you have on your plate. Perhaps assistance will be more readily forthcoming when you mix with new people rather than the same old faces. 
LEO, Leo: As the hours pass, your planetary picture begins to look increasingly mature and responsible, and less concerned with 'having fun'. That's why your entertainment requirements may therefore veer towards the highbrow or cultural, and an expensive evening out could be a fine idea. 
VIRGO, Virgo: If you are to seize the moment, you must be in the right place at the right time. Your biggest asset at the moment is enthusiasm, the greatest failing is complacency. Deal with children and younger people in a firm but fair manner, offering them appropriate encouragement whenever you can. Also Read | Under the spotlight: Feeble efforts by Cong brass to resolve MP crisis 
LIBRA, Libra: Not a single emotional compromise or concession should be made until family members have been consulted, and that might not be possible until another few days have passed. You can begin to consider the potential of a possible new financial venture, consulting the experts whenever necessary. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Venus, planet of love and of victory in war, is now forming a fresh alignment with your sign, giving you the edge in all personal considerations. Save some time for serious discussions over long-term family matters, as people you live with need to hear your opinions. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The whole situation is looking considerably more certain than even a short while ago. At least now you should have the confidence to move ahead, perhaps because the financial situation will soon be more secure, but also because someone who was critical will soon soften their tone. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Hidden truths are about to be revealed. A mystery will soon be solved, a lost item found, and a rumour proved false. You may also soon realise just how a dream may be put into practice, although precise plans may have to be left until later. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Venus, planet of love, now shifts the emotional goal posts. It looks as if you will be making more demands on people, perhaps because you are ambitious on their behalf, perhaps because you wish them to live your life for you. Don't be surprised if they don't see eye-to-eye. Also Read | Dec 16 gangrape: Till last moment, convicts kept hoping for court miracle 
TAURUS, Taurus: Personal projects which once looked fraught with difficulty and beset by obstacles, now seem to be strangely free from problems. The only remaining complications could be financial, though with excellent chances of improvement. It all depends on your sense of timing. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Everything now hinges around your ability to get on with other people. Indeed, it seems as if they have the whip hand, so your best chance may be to agree with their every word, and accept that it can be pleasant to allow others to take the initiative. Your turn will come very soon. CANCER Cancer: By all accounts you will have little time left over after completing all those steadily increasing tasks and duties. You'll be burning the candle at both ends, but you'll be no use to anyone if you overdo it, least of all to yourself. Take it one step at a time. Also Read | December 16, 2012 gangrape convicts hanged at Tihar Jail 
LEO, Leo: Financial extravagance is the key today, and the ripples arising from current risks and commitments will be felt for at least two weeks, if not twelve months. Sporting types should be on course for triumphs and trophies, so aim to improve on your personal best. 
VIRGO, Virgo: This is a remarkable moment for improvements in family relationships and welcome changes in all domestic conditions. Accept that an element of uncertainty is inevitable, but don't let that put you off. After all, someone who has disagreed with you will soon see the error of their ways. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your nomadic qualities are being stirred up. Short journeys are likely to be made on the basis of family needs, rather than pleasure, but there is bound to be stimulation for you in encountering new places and environments. The more you travel, the richer your experience will be. Also Read | Janata Curfew &amp; Janata Thank You Sunday: PM says don't lower guard 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You appear to be locked into a set of financial attitudes and commitments that no longer suit your requirements or talents. Other people must now make it clear that they back you to the hilt, otherwise there is no reason why you should continue to do your best for them. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Today's lunar alignments influence all that is most special to you, arousing hope for the future. Don't worry if your ideas are still unclear, but recognise that prestige and professional projects are about to take off. All they need is one last almighty push. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There is so much going on behind the scenes that you might feel as if you are to be sucked in to something that is only half-understood. You may wish to distance yourself from people who are unnecessarily aggressive. If they are intent on confrontation, then that is their business - and nothing to do with you! Also Read | Coronavirus: Doctor turned away by 4 hospitals over virus fears, now on ventilator AQUARIUS Aquarius: You need more credit - and partners may not deserve as much sympathy as you have given them. However, you could have little choice in the matter, and you will almost certainly be obliged to listen to their complaints. You never know -you may even come out with the advice they've been waiting for. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Your current planetary activity will probably put you on the spot at work, or even create a little bother over plans which you thought had been signed and sealed. You may have no choice but to complete what has been started - and fulfil all the promises you've made. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mercury, the planet responsible for your thoughts and plans, appears to be hiding its more logical qualities behind a curious refusal to behave. That could be one reason why partners may now be reluctant to reach agreement or meet your standards and requirements. CANCER Cancer: For about the next forty-eight hours your financial prospects will be reaching a monthly peak. This doesn't mean that everything will be easy, but that this is nevertheless an auspicious moment to settle matters such as domestic purchases or property deals. 
LEO, Leo: This promises to be a memorable phase for all intensely personal matters. You will probably do yourself a power of good by realising that abandoning certain commitments doesn't mean that you're reckless or irresponsible. Instead, it indicates that you've got a better idea of your own needs. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Recent surprise developments in home and family arrangements have exposed only the tip of a very deep iceberg. During the last few weeks you have probably imagined that all was going to continue as before, but your hope now must be that it will be better. 
LIBRA, Libra: The only way to make sense of life at the moment is to realise what astrologers have always known - that what people say is not necessarily the same as what they do. In fact, the two are often completely different. That could account for a someone's extravagant claims or offers. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: A fantastic relationship between Venus and Jupiter could put the final seal on a new friendship or romantic connection. What is needed now is a determination to succeed, to actually make things work. You may need to call on one of your practical friends for help in the meantime. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Once in a while challenging aspects act in your favour. In other words, difficult events are sent to help you. You may allow yourself to show your feelings, even if it means shedding a tear or two, especially if it's for happiness. Partners should respect your openness. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You are obliged to honour all past commitments or obligations at the moment, even if you only have a dim recollection of why they were made in the first place! Some sort of personal sacrifice may be necessary, but what you give up now will be repaid many times over in the future. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You've got some very mature decisions to make very soon. Hopefully you will stand aside over the next couple of weeks and allow associates to play more of a dominant role. If you attempt to stand in their way for no good reason, you may come off worst. 
TAURUS, You could easily overstep the mark this week, perhaps encouraged now by the Moon's emotional alignments. You may, for example, be easily provoked, but you'd do well to listen to what partners are trying to say. You might realise that they were really on your side all the time. 
GEMINI, If you are still licking your wounds you are likely to completely miss fresh warning signals alerting you to new irritations. You may be out-classed and out-gunned, so a tactical withdrawal could be in your best interests. Until you are ready for a second chance, that is. CANCER You may be preoccupied with personal affairs. It would be very much wiser to face up to challenges at work, but it may not be possible to make a clean sweep. There does still seem to be a great deal more to take place before you can see the final outcome. READ | Coronavirus: 63-year-old Mumbai man received his own ‘death message', say neighbours 
LEO, It's time to make up your mind. Decisions that are finalised or agreed now, should encourage you to stop prevaricating over a domestic upheaval, perhaps to do with children, or a creative matter, but only if you recognise the value of authority and tradition. 
VIRGO, The Sun is related to that decisive planet Uranus, providing an interesting sub-plot for today's planetary sermon, encouraging you to change direction at home. A domestic gamble, for example, should pay off. First, though, ask people you live with what they really want. READ | Jacqueline Fernandez: Asim Riaz is a down-to-earth, talented boy 
LIBRA, The spread of positive planets in your horoscope, suggests that the only important considerations at the moment are purely personal. Even at work you will have to be true to yourself - nobody will respect you if you pretend you can accomplish tasks which are not in your normal line. 
SCORPIO, You may be in the right, and more than entitled to challenge others' statements and opinions. However, time has moved on, and even though you might be quite correct, some people may be chronically incapable of realising the truth of what you say. That, though, is their problem! 
SAGITTARIUS, What comes to light in a roundabout manner should at last enable you to issue the odd ultimatum - or three! If people don't submit right away, you may give them another few days at least. And if they still don't agree then you might have to change your plans! Explained: Five steps to detecting the virus 
CAPRICORN, You probably feel like taking a sabbatical from several important tasks, challenges or responsibilities. You may have to concede that there is no chance of getting to the root of a current predicament. Perhaps some mysteries are not meant to be solved! AQUARIUS Other people can be so maddening at times. If you are to ensure that team and group activities turn out in your favour, you will have to admit to rather more than you ever thought possible. Still, sometimes the more you give, the greater your rewards in the end. 
TAURUS, This is a decisive period of the year for matters related to matrimonial contacts and all intimate relationships. In some senses emotional encounters and experiences will be a prologue to what will be taking place over the next three, marvellous months. 
GEMINI, The future is not here yet, but it's coming fast. The great thing to remember is that approaching emotional lunar alignments are already having an initial impact on your consciousness. Happily, it is due to signify a whole new fresh start in family and domestic affairs. CANCER You would be well advised to play safe and not try to even the score on the home front - even if a loved one has got the better of you. You have almost played your last card, and must now move with great circumspection. The emphasis must be on getting on with partners at all costs. 
LEO, You need to do your sums and not allow yourself to be sidetracked by what other people, perhaps lovers, or children, may want. At the heart of the matter is your need to press ahead with projects which may make very much more sense to you than to others. 
VIRGO, You're walking a very thin tightrope and even a minor disagreement with loved ones could turn into a major source of conflict. It might be in your best interests to throw all arrangements and agreements into the melting pot, enabling new decisions to be made. 
LIBRA, Current planetary positions indicate that you have all the ingenuity and intelligence to deal effectively with the tasks that lie ahead. But you may have to recognise that you will have to do without the personal support that has sustained you so far. 
SCORPIO, Your imagination is colourful indeed, but you have been rather over-influenced by your fantasies, and if you have taken them too far you may soon have some explaining to do! You must proceed with maximum caution, especially in joint financial matters. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is important to establish who is responsible for what, so you can feel more confident about the chances for success. This may not be a time for genuine partnership, but it is a fine moment for doing your own thing. Strike out by yourself and show other people the way. 
CAPRICORN, The past couple of years have undoubtedly been ones of upheaval, combined with periods of confusion. Your current stars indicate that now is the time to enquire within, coming up with unusual answers to familiar problems. If you're out on the town, be sure to let your hair down! AQUARIUS Your current experiences relate to developments which took place a few months ago, when Saturn, planet of long-range hopes, last occupied a similar position. When dealing with long-term responsibilities you should realise that only genuine teamwork will allow you a way out. 
TAURUS, Taurus: For once the planets are supremely considerate, aligned with your houses of work, partnerships and money in different ways. You could have a conventional day if you wish, but you can also gently experiment with new options. And then you can enjoy family and friendly activities.

GEMINI, Gemini: Your basic lunar picture reverses the day's normal arrangements, favouring leisure early on, followed by powerful working influences this evening! This is obviously perfect if you're either a shift worker, or if you only click into gear when evening family obligations take over. CANCER Cancer: You may not know what to do at work, but that won't prevent you from doing it! You must accept that past decisions may have to be revived, and there is nothing to be ashamed of in admitting that you may have been wrong. In fact, a partner might follow suit and concede that they weren't always right either! 
LEO, Leo: It's an intriguing day for communication and discussion. This naturally favours those of you with important arguments to make, or interviews to attend. The mood of the week, as will become clear over the next few days, is creative rather than routine. 
VIRGO, Virgo: The prevailing mood should be generally optimistic, but you have to make sure that your expectations match up with reality. Do try to tackle financial issues, amongst which are your own extravagant tendencies. There is nothing wrong with spending more than necessary, just as long as you have the readies in your pocket! 
LIBRA, Libra: Although the general situation is looking very positive, you must realise that in a number of minor issues the sands of time are running out. In particular, a run of social or emotional good luck is now almost coming full circle. That's why you need to pay attention to partners who are disgruntled. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The fact that constructive alignments are powerful today, directly supports elements of your emotional character. Your deep secrecy and concern with justice, should guide your feelings. Your behaviour should be designed to boost the common good rather than merely your own self-interest. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: This is your week. Don't imagine that what happens on any one day will take place in isolation from the rest of your life. Instead, take a look at the way doors are opening to the future. The more detailed your plans, then the better the outcome will be. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Happily, the general situation looks very reassuring. At work, a reasonably ambitious day may raise questions of law, morality and rights. An overseas contact may also come to be of increasing significance, and you might have a chance to mend fences with someone you haven't seen for a long time. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The overwhelming general influence today is nice and pleasant. You should therefore be cushioned against lingering stress in a number of areas, including social engagements. You may be reminded of certain long-term responsibilities late this evening. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Jupiter is still aligned with communicative regions of your chart, enabling you to put your case with energy, verve, enthusiasm - and sensitivity. This is therefore an ideal time to arrange meetings, hold discussions, attend interviews and generally lay out a firm strategy for the future. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The principle astrological alignments at the moment are undoubtedly helpful, and you may therefore count on a successful outcome whatever you do, and as long as you play fair by others. Moneywise you seem to be functioning very well, at least better than in the past, although any joint arrangements could prove surprisingly complicated. READ | The Corona Fighters Express series: 24/7, a CMO and his team track the virus CANCER Cancer: Sometimes the stars tell you to think about others. You must be prepared to put your own interests to one side and place yourself at the disposal of those who need your support and sympathy, no matter how much this may tax your emotional reserves. Also, do be aware that there must be no delay in implementing domestic and family improvements. 
LEO, Leo: You appear to have itchy feet and are probably desperate for a change of scenery, mainly thanks to a group of planets in your third solar house. The likelihood is of many short journeys rather than a long voyage, but life will be no less adventurous for all that. What will mean most to you will be the chance to enjoy some genuine peace and quiet. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Friends will be ready to listen and eager to help, so do not keep doubts and worries to yourself. Some of you are getting the idea that love is a more important part of your relationships than mere emotional security. However, as the days pass you'll realise that what is most important is your financial situation. READ | SBI heartless, inefficient, FM tells its chairman 
LIBRA, Libra: The next few weeks are nothing short of remarkable for all those who are in the midst of a professional and personal revolution, mainly because you'll be revisiting the past before recreating the future. Emotionally you are about to move on to an entirely new level of experience which may involve a move of home. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You key planetary alignments this week advise you to take more care. One word of caution is to avoid saying ‘yes' to absolutely every offer and find yourself totally over-committed as a result. Plus, you must try to keep all your actions absolutely open and above board if you are not to be misunderstood. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Welcome surprises lie just around the corner. Social activities will benefit in ways which will probably astound you, and events are likely to be so rapid that you may temporarily lose your bearings. This is therefore due to be a period loaded with romantic stimulation and excitement in exactly the right combination. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Your desire for prestige, status and recognition in the community must be satisfied somehow, and the sooner the better. Fortunately Saturn, your planetary ruler, is occupying a particularly intriguing position, offering every hope for your future success and happiness. What you still need, though, is a touch more self-confidence. READ | Neha Dhupia on Roadies Revolution controversy: Physical abuse or assault is not acceptable AQUARIUS Aquarius: Your overall emotional condition is thoroughly strengthened by Jupiter's alignment with prosperous sectors of your chart, for prosperity breeds confidence. Don't forget the physical world, for this is an ideal time to institute an improved regime of regular exercise and a more sensible balanced diet. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Close partners may have been in a difficult mood, but it does take two to start an argument, doesn't it? A certain person seems to be terribly volatile and you may do best to put your own qualms and complaints to one side and lend a sympathetic ear. Read | Fighting coronavirus: Malls, restaurants in Karnataka; gyms, cinemas in Mumbai; more states invoke epidemic rules 
GEMINI, Gemini: You have been contemplating drastic answers to relatively minor questions, buoyed up by Mars' energising influence. Yet according to all the current indications you'll still have problems putting your plans into practice. Just a little more thought - and effort - could do it. CANCER Cancer: It so happens that your relations with friends are ruled by Taurus, and this explains why loyalty comes at the top of your list of priorities. If you can extol the virtues of punctuality and fidelity to others, please do so. You never know - you might learn something in the process. Also Read | Catching 22 
LEO, Leo: Watch out for emotional, possibly hysterical, people at work. Somebody seems to think that they have the right to tell everybody else what to do. For this reason, your home may act as a sort of bolt-hole. You may even need to lick your emotional wounds. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You are no doubt up against big communication difficulties, but why others should misunderstand you is another matter. Are they determined to pick up the wrong end of the stick? Or are you failing to make yourself clear? Perhaps it's a mixture of the two! Read | Hoarding shaming: As SC refers to larger bench, UP brings a law 
LIBRA, Libra: Averaged out over the years, it seems that this is normally a fairly profitable time of year. However, with every opportunity comes a risk and your timing must be spot on. Even if your resources are limited, you may duck and dive and make a little extra cash. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You have heard enough empty promises to be especially impressed by smooth-talking partners. So, if you hear people spouting nonsense today, that's all the more reason for you to lay down the law. The trouble is, they might not realise they're not making sense! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: There are a great many useful ways to apply your gifts. Even if someone close to you is still bad-tempered or irritable, you can dodge the issues by getting on with a favourite activity or hobby. The basic principle is that a little of what you fancy does you good. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Passions are running high, and for some of you the storm clouds are gathering. However, with a conscious act of will, you may be able to direct such powerful energies towards cultural and pleasurable pursuits, not to mention dramatic and theatrical outbursts. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You may feel obliged to go on the defensive, but if you take a placatory approach then the pressure should start to ease. One problem may be that you fail to give other people due recognition for their achievements, and that they end up feeling resentful. Praise partners when they deserve it! 
TAURUS, Taurus: There are pressures on you to get on with essential jobs, but can you really follow someone else's agenda? If you wish, you may give yourself twenty-four hours before leaping into action. However, there seem to be several domestic matters to be resolved before you can feel truly safe, secure and confident. And you must keep colleagues, employers and loved ones informed. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The lessons you are having to learn now may be making you uncomfortable, but you're not alone in feeling slightly unsettled. The simple truth is that you are being encouraged to take on more than you can handle, which may in fact be no bad thing. CANCER Cancer: Passion is in the air as the Sun and the Moon approach a strident relationship, mixing female power with male energy. Your close partnerships are nothing if not interesting at the moment, and there really is considerable opportunity to get out and have a little fun. 
LEO, Leo: When the chips are down, you're really quite sensitive! You realise only too clearly that difficulties between you and other people are not just going to disappear, but you may find solace in the company of certain family members, perhaps younger relatives. READ | COVID-19: India quarantines itself 
VIRGO, Virgo: You've been hanging on, but you will soon hear something to your advantage. I expect that the implications may take some considerable time to sink in, but when they do then you'll realise how well off you are. Look hard enough and you'll find the silver lining! 
LIBRA, Libra: If you've got your wits about you, today should prove to be productive and profitable. Most of the planets raise the question of your finances, even indirectly, and ask just when are you going to get your act together? The answer is - when you're ready! READ | First Impression: Disney+ Hotstar's The Mandalorian 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It's certainly a day of extremes. On the one hand, everything really is going in your direction. On the other, it may be that you just can't put a foot right where your other half's concerned. But, then, there are few people as skilled as you at walking emotional tight ropes. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You have a tendency to overdo things. It's an emotional day and, while people around you seem to be basically well-intentioned, there will be a complete disregard for the facts - with all the risks that this entails. If you aren't up on the details yourself, then bring other people in to help. 
CAPRICORN, Capricon: It's a day to mix with friends and lovers, both old and new. Your social stars are often highlighted at this time of year but, this year, they are stronger than ever, so take pleasure in other people's company. You never know who is going to be important to you in the future. READ | In Lok Sabha, Amit Shah says Delhi rioters identified using facial scan AQUARIUS Aquarius: You probably feel unsure about who your friends are; you've always had many acquaintances, but often few people to whom you're really close. Spare a little extra thought for family members, especially those who are younger and need your help, even if they're reluctant to ask for it. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You may be under quite a lot of pressure, but today's stars enable you to focus on yourself in an almost meditative fashion. Please spare a little time for a spot of rejuvenating day-dreaming. You may well find that what pops out of your unconscious shows you the solution to a knotty problem.

GEMINI, Gemini: Mars is playing games with you and sending your energy level up and down like a yo-yo. In spite of all this, you have all the strength, stamina and support you need to get through whatever is making you so uncomfortable. Remember the old saying: it's good to talk! CANCER Cancer: If you have not already been filled with hope for the future, the stars are not fulfilling their allotted task. One of the best ways to use your current celestial energy is to give yourself over to hedonism and pleasure. But it's not the only way: you can also start developing an artistic skill.

LEO, Leo: Others may well try to override your views or undermine your concerns, playing rather devious games. I can see no particular prospect that anyone will genuinely weaken your interests, but you should also avoid fuelling other people's jealousy or ambitions. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You probably feel a little trapped, but the way to get out of a rut at the moment is quite simple. First of all, you should analyse the situation, listing all the pros and cons. Then implement your plans with complete commonsense. There's no room for sentiment. Read | Yes Bank crisis: Trustee moves Bombay HC against RBI plan to write down AT-1 bonds 
LIBRA, Libra: Your emotional goalposts are shifting, and as the day goes by it will become progressively easier to see your partnerships in perspective. You may have little choice but to follow family members' wishes as far as home arrangements are concerned, but it's no real hardship. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Concentrate on your creative talents and fit in more interest and variety. I really think that you should take the lead amongst your friends and impose your personality on the world around you. If you're facing an emotional obstacle then slow down and subject it to clear, close, Scorpionic analysis. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: If it's difficult to take decisions, then it's because the information is changing too fast. You are looking distinctly doubtful and self-questioning, but you may as well stop worrying over what other people think about you. After all, they are probably completely and utterly wrong! 
CAPRICORN, Capricon: Why not give yourself a day's grace? Get up to date with domestic chores and keep the wheels well-oiled at home, but wait until the next dramatic Solar and Lunar alignments in a few weeks' time, if you've got any major trump cards up your sleeve. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You are now making valuable progress in both personal and professional matters. Next week you'll probably go through a U-turn, so keep your diary relatively flexible. It really will be a case of last-minute changes, and that's why you've got to keep up with the news. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Your hopes may be slightly unrealistic, but there's nothing wrong with optimism. Others may find your enthusiasm infectious, and the impact on your social life should be very welcome indeed. Anyone who comes into contact with you will benefit from your positive approach - and you'll bask in the glory. Follow Holi 2020 LIVE updates  
GEMINI, Gemini: Nothing is ever quite as it seems. You may have been labouring under some kind of misapprehension, but I don't think you have been completely wrong in all respects. There's, therefore, no need to feel too embarrassed or regretful. Besides, favourable financial deals add to the spirit of optimism. CANCER Cancer: Individualistic and independent Cancerians are favoured, rather than those of you who tend to follow the herd. In any event, there seems to be plenty of scope to enjoy yourself and every opportunity to have a party. Don't wait for other people to take the lead - or you might have to wait for ever! Read | Politics after the Poetry 
LEO, Leo: Expect agreement over contentious issues, but only if you are prepared to lay yourself on the line. If you hold something back then I am afraid that partners, children, friends and associates will instinctively realise that you're not being entirely straight. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Even if you feel shut in a corner and unwanted, there really is a great deal going for you. For one thing, a mystery which may have been unsolved for many years is about to be cleared up. You may even have forgotten what it was you didn't know in the first place! Also Read | Weeks after August 5 move, seeds of new J&amp;K party sown in Delhi 
LIBRA, Libra: Although I know you tend to worry about your financial security, I also know that there is every reason to feel hopeful about the future. You may not have to do anything to make a windfall come your way. But you will have to keep your eyes open - otherwise it might pass you by. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: If you are in a negative mood then you may be attracting difficult circumstances. Astrology, you see, assumes that ultimately we are all much more responsible for our own destinies than we at first imagine. Adopt an optimistic attitude and you could attract a much better class of event! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Money can become an all too-consuming passion, not because of your astrological character at birth, but on account of the current planetary disposition. You're as happy to give as to receive and you'll be a soft touch for any charity. And good for you! Read | In MP, Kamal Nath govt battles threat from Scindia camp, BJP sniffs a chance 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You'll give advice only when, and if, you are asked for it. The point is that although you have been through a great deal, you have not yet fully understood enough to be able to tell others what they should do. Wait until you know exactly what's what before making your next move. Also Read | Explained: How Yes Bank ran into crisis AQUARIUS Aquarius: A temporary advantage could soon become a personal route to permanent success. This is why your timing must be perfect and your appreciation of circumstances extremely acute. Complacency is not permissible at the moment: you have to stay very alert if you are to catch every passing offer and invitation. 
TAURUS, Taurus: This is your week. By this I mean that enterprises and projects set in train three, or even six months ago, should soon come to fruition, much to your satisfaction. Keep all your options open until the last moment. And remember that whatever you're planning now could bear fruit this time next year. 
GEMINI, Gemini: It's difficult to describe your exact situation at the moment but there could be something vaguely farcical about certain developments. Do maintain your sense of humour: you have two choices - to laugh or to cry. But, then, perhaps you'll laugh so hard that you cry! CANCER Cancer: The Moon is profoundly helpful, so positive lunar alignments should lift your spirits, making you content to be an emotional and sensitive creature. The most harmonious aspects encourage your poetic, persuasive frame of mind, which is wonderful for those of you with proposals to promote. READ | 102-year-old readies CV as BJP puts him to freedom fighter test 
LEO, Leo: You may as well face the fact that intense planetary patterns are obliging you to cope with intimate and personal matters. The fact that there is little room for compromise is complicated by the sheer number of options. You just have too many choices! 
VIRGO, Virgo: The themes for the week are travel and communication. If there are places to visit, friends to contact, interviews to attend and meetings to arrange, you're on to a winner. Treat partners with great sympathy today, for even if they behave badly it's because they're under extra stress. READ | War heroes who resisted Portuguese: the mega film Kerala is talking about 
LIBRA, Libra: Sometimes the old sayings are the truest and, as the song says, it's money that makes the world go round. It does seem that you have a great deal to learn from current financial developments, but you have to wait a week or so before you can be sure that you're in for a healthy profit. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You are happily telling people anything they want to hear - and why not? It is a change for you to turn your sharp tongue and ready wit towards cheering partners up instead of needling them with your legendary sense of humour. A loved one who feels hurt needs your healing hands. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Why are you so misunderstood? This is one of your perennial questions. The real problem seems to be a failure of communication, that you don't actually explain yourself properly. It may also be that something personal has not gone according to plan.

CAPRICORN, Capricon: Happily, the Sun is forming a set of very fortuitous relationships, so that even when sudden change takes place, you'll make the most of it. Something you half-expected but never really believed would happen, is now about to take place. It's certainly a strange time! AQUARIUS Aquarius: The ambitious Aquarian is an awesome sight at the moment. Woe betide anyone who stands in your way as you lay your plans for world conquest!

TAURUS, Taurus: A decisive aspect involving Venus will add a creative and pleasurable shape to your romantic and emotional aspirations - and may continue to do so for a month or so longer. The main priority is your personal independence, although it doesn't seem that your desire not to be tied down will lead directly to a break with a close friend. 
GEMINI, Gemini: This is a highly positive period, largely due to the support you are receiving from Mercury, your planetary ruler. This fascinating planet encourages you to express your spontaneous, almost child-like nature, enabling you to duck a number of responsibilities. However, you will still find it impossible to avoid all those core liabilities! CANCER Cancer: Even though life is generally going your way, there are bound to be one or two ups and downs. For example, someone is obviously not going to give in or give up as easily as you naively imagined. Take a mature approach and recognise that other people have much to teach you. And pay attention to strange coincidences which always seem to crop up at times like these. 
LEO, Leo: The most important planetary activity links romantic Venus with serious Saturn and optimistic Jupiter in a line-up of overwhelmingly powerful potential. Some sort of confrontation at home does seem to be almost inevitable, if only as a result of the rate at which your ideas are diverging from those of people you live with. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Mercury is your ruling planet, and therefore one of the most important celestial factors in your life at the present time. Now that this remarkable heavenly body is connecting with Venus and Mars you must expect your affairs to become rather more intense and shaped by blind faith rather than by cool reason. 
LIBRA, Libra: Mars has certainly been exerting an energetic role in your affairs. However, this is not a planet which has a natural affinity with your sign, and you should find that some of the social and professional situations you get into may be rather stressful. You will look to loved ones for support, but may not actually receive it unless you ask. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It is thanks to Mercury's prosperous movements that you simply have to speak out and take the initiative in financial matters. This is a fascinating time for you and you're in an ideal position to turn the tables on people who have got the better of you in the past. A loved one is about to admit they made a mistake, so you can afford to be a little pleased with yourself. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: There's a great deal going on behind the scenes but this shouldn't prevent you from making the most of your social life, which seems to have been flourishing lately. As time passes you will become more interested in intimate relationships, which provide deeper satisfaction, than in mixing with a wide circle of friends. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Emotional generosity boosts your morale, but you are still reeling from Saturn's impact in an ambitious region of your solar chart, placing obstacles in the way of your career hopes and professional ambitions. You have been under great pressure to formulate long-term plans which, when put into action, will carry you through the next few years. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Astrology is all about change, as the stars and planets move endlessly through your chart. It's also all about possibilities. Therefore you must try to understand both the diversity of the options open to you and the ways in which these are continually evolving. During the current period you are being faced with the need to put your principles into action. 
TAURUS, Taurus: It's your last chance to make an important decision that you've been putting off for ages. For the next two weeks it's very much a matter of tying up all the loose ends and keeping partners sweet. The more people you have on your side, the better you'll feel! 
GEMINI, Gemini: Loved ones have really got on your nerves lately, but are you sure that you are blameless? Without even realising it you may have let someone else down or trodden on their toes. This is no time for instant judgments or verdicts, so wait until you have all the information. CANCER Cancer: I don't often tell you to lower your sights, but now I am worried that if you are too exclusive you may miss a vital opportunity or fail to make a valuable connection. I don't think you'll put a foot wrong, but you do need to open your eyes to possibilities you might never have considered. 
LEO, Leo: You'll resist any tendency to duck the issues at home. Although you may not realise it, you have hit on the right solution, but you may need to wait for others to catch up with you. What is obvious to you, may not be clear to them, which is precisely why you should be a little more understanding. 
VIRGO, Virgo: There is a strong chance that you will begin to look far afield for inspiration and enlightenment. You can leave any work battles to one side and instead concentrate on improving the overall quality of your life. You'll look back later and see the wisdom of your actions. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your plans to travel and communicate more are certainly in line with the promise of the stars: you might have plans of practical value to discuss with distant relations. Solid business opportunities are in the air, but you may be better advised to go for a safe bargain rather than risk all on an extravagant outburst. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You will be forced to face a whole series of issues and questions involving close partners. It doesn't matter much whether it is private or public life which preoccupies you. All that is important is the quality of your closest relationships. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: As soon as you stop thinking you know all the answers, you'll also cease pounding your head against the nearest brick wall. The current Sun-Moon angle announces that this is a time to get the balance back into your life, and that means trimming your deepest desires. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: This is without a doubt a decisive period, but you are probably able to take care of yourself. If you can advance yourself socially, so much the better. If you're lucky enough to benefit from romantic hopes, then enjoy your good fortune. And, if you're offered a compliment, then accept it! AQUARIUS Aquarius: Being mistress, or even master, of your own household, is more important to you today than being respected by the world as a whole. Yet don't forget that next week may bring even greater pressures on you to make a name for yourself. The question remains, though, as to how you're going to pay for your dreams. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You're liable to bite off more than you can chew right now. Jupiter, the planet of growth, has a habit of exaggerating your claims and inflating your expectations. It can also encourage you to double-book yourself, which may not please partners. Get organised! 
GEMINI, Gemini: The emphasis on money, survival and security looks set to continue over the next few days, although there is little indication as to whether your purposes will be best served by spending or saving: it may be another three months before you get a proper fix on material matters. CANCER Cancer: Yesterday's important lunar alignment remains the dominant presence today, rendering you more emotional than usual, but also increasingly determined to overcome all personal hassles and professional obstructions. In other words, you can actually have your cake and eat it! 
LEO, Leo: Although you've caught the travel bug and may be obsessed by the belief that farthest pastures are greenest, you'll be in a relatively serious phase. Some sort of pilgrimage would capture the mood of the times. Perhaps a trip to your personal past could do the trick. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You'll be demanding passion in relationships. The only hitch is that you are so shy that you even conceal certain fundamental emotional drives from yourself. This may lead to no end of complications! The first step is to start talking to yourself - and then tell others what you've found out! 
LIBRA, Libra: Don't imagine that every new friend or acquaintance can take the place of established ties. If professional schemes are on the go, press ahead, weekend or no. Romantic events could lead to higher costs as business and pleasure seem to become inextricably linked. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The Moon indicates a continuing favourable, dynamic trend in your life and urges you to seek the attention and recognition you deserve. Travelling and adventurous Scorpios have picked their time well, and all your journeys could have a creative dimension. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Spending is more heavily favoured than saving, so you may as well splash out with no thought for tomorrow. Social and romantic links are likely to be based around shared interests and activities: what you really need at the moment is companionship and a sense of belonging. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: If you have managed to remain calm and kept your temper under control, even when it was clear that others were trying to pull the wool over your eyes, you may be unable to resist the temptation to blow your top over the next few days. You might end up having to apologise, though! AQUARIUS Aquarius: Today's planetary aspects are of the kind that favour Aquarians who place principles before personal interest. If you wish, you may want to follow romantic whims and even self-sacrificing desires! Mind you, you still need other people to stand by and give you their support. 
TAURUS, You have worked too hard and sacrificed too much to allow anyone to get the upper hand or take you for a ride. Eventually, you will be in a position to persuade people of the truth of your cause, but first you've got to deal with your own lingering doubts! 
GEMINI, The Moon's relationship with your second solar house is a marvellous indication that your financial cycle is about to improve. It is especially auspicious that a one-year cycle and an eighteen-year pattern are now coinciding in a most delightful manner. CANCER The Moon falls in a new sector of your solar chart, inaugurating a phase of dynamic optimism. At least, this is the most positive reading of your current celestial prospects. Just be prepared for the possibility that you'll have to do certain jobs yourself at work. 
LEO, Spend a little time by yourself if possible. There is a great deal to be learnt from quiet contemplation and, in any case, you'll need to recharge your batteries. Your travel stars remain bright, but with an emphasis on visits to much-loved and familiar places. 
VIRGO, There's a great temptation to spend more than you can afford. I'd like to remind you that now is not necessarily the best time to make speculative gains. Indeed, gamblers will almost certainly be losers. The best risks are those taken with a complete understanding of the odds. 
LIBRA, No experience is wasted, and you should try to realise that all the testing experiences you are undergoing are designed to sharpen up your act. You may have to accept that a partner is bound to criticise or accuse you unfairly, but let's hope they'll listen to reason in the end. 
SCORPIO, At last there are signs that you're getting your own way. In fact, very soon you ought to be covering a lot of new ground. The Moon's benign alignments will eventually send you off in search of extra excitement and adventure but first you need to sort out a small cash complication. 
SAGITTARIUS, In your solar chart, the emotional sign of Cancer represents your reliance on money as a means of guaranteeing your future security. Today's lunar picture implies that all will be well in this department. It also advises you to turn to people you've known for a long time, and can trust totally, for the best advice. 
CAPRICORN, Your very personal affairs seem to have been in a state of flux ever since Mars, planet of energy and anger, set the cat among the pigeons at home, stirring up strange emotions amongst people you live with. You have one important task to complete, and that is to come to a partner's aid. AQUARIUS In the long-term you can and will derive lasting benefits, even from enforced changes in your lifestyle. But the present phase of uncertainty is likely to continue until at least the beginning of next week. If you take a different perspective, then you'll see that when confusion reigns you have a chance to change your mind. 
TAURUS, Venus is still offering you its blessings, but while this planet normally brings love without strings, right now it indicates that relationships are nothing without responsibility and commitment. You're still in a secretive mood, but that's only to be expected. 
GEMINI, The best friendships are likely to be formed with people who are older or wiser than you. Certainly, you'll value age and experience and you may be attracted to people you work with, or with whom you share common activities. One other thing: make sure that all social engagements are firmed up. Read | Coronavirus outbreak: 23 new cases, Govt to screen all international passengers on arrival CANCER As the next lunar alignment approaches, partners, loved ones and offspring all seem to want your undivided attention. You must do what you can to protect your territory and preserve your personal space. If you're called on to do extra work, then go ahead, but make sure that every extra atom of effort counts. 
LEO, Solar and lunar influences over the next twenty-four hours may lead you to new conclusions. Even though there's a chance you may feel briefly undermined, the outcome will be positive if it forces you to think again. You'll get it right next time around - all with the benefit of hindsight. 
VIRGO, Your talents are many - and have often been underestimated. Politically-minded Virgos will be coming into their own. Even those of you who have never regarded yourselves as political creatures will be moving inexorably towards involvement in the community. 
LIBRA, You probably won't notice any change today, but the opposition is now beginning to crumble both at home and at work - and not before time. Arguments which have been used to deny you your rights will dissolve under the steady drip of the waters of Libran truth. Read | Govt in Parliament: No religion break-up of citizenship granted 
SCORPIO, There are certain ties and associations which must now be handled with great tact, not to mention sympathy and understanding. Fortunately, there is nobody better than a Scorpio at dealing with such delicate tasks. Hopefully partners will recognise this! 
SAGITTARIUS, Making choices is a Sagittarian speciality, but the decisions that are looming now concern more than the everyday details of daily life. In a sense, it is your entire lifestyle which must shift, but just how and when may not be revealed for another two months. 
CAPRICORN, Given that a special but little-known celestial point, the Moon's north node, is hovering in helpful regions of your chart, you can be confident that whatever the daily ups and downs, your financial situation is still moving from loss to profit. Read | No Time To Die release pushed back seven months due to coronavirus AQUARIUS Most of the conflicts in your solar chart at the moment relate to your inner feelings of insecurity. The trouble is that while the astrological causes are so simple, the remedy may require a great deal of self-knowledge and discipline. So, stop for a while - and think! 
TAURUS, Don't spend too much time going over old ground. Nostalgia for the past is all very well, but if you've important projects on the go, or if someone is depending on you, you should keep your attention pinned firmly on the present. If someone has let you down, then don't be too hard on them - it might not be their fault. 
GEMINI, The chances of a secret romance or discreet encounter are still pretty strong, although any thoughts you may have had of going behind somebody's back are now likely to be outweighed by good old puritanical guilt: you know as well as anyone what is right and what is wrong. READ | Meet the ‘Superstar Sidekicks' from old Bollywood CANCER Certain personal boundaries seem to have become rather blurred recently, and if you are a typical Cancerian you may be wondering where it will all end. Yet I have no doubt at all that intimate partners will see the sense in what you are doing. 
LEO, All general planetary patterns indicate that partners are encouraging you to do your best. While advising you to avoid going over the top, I must remind you of the old astrological law that the better the future you expect, the better the future will be. Confidence breeds success. 
VIRGO, Your social stars are stirring - at long last, some would say! It's time to broaden your horizons and take as many new ideas on board as you can. Get out and about over the next four weeks, and even accept invitations you'd normally treat with disdain. 
LIBRA, There are certain days when it is wiser to be polite and charming whatever the provocation - and this is one of them. Fortunately, you were born with an innate propensity to turn the other cheek. That does, of course, mean that sometimes other people do walk all over you! READ | It's official: Complaint against any PM will go to Lokpal full bench, no explanation if rejected 
SCORPIO, Colleagues or co-workers may have been asserting themselves recently. In fact, I don't think you have been given a fair hearing. All you can do is undermine others' inflated faith in themselves, and if you prick someone's bubble then they've probably asked for it! 
SAGITTARIUS, The emphasis on financial stars continues with a general note that anything connected with water is assuming greater significance. Does this refer to a holiday by the sea? Or merely routine plumbing problems? It could actually also indicate strange, illuminating dreams. READ | WhatsApp groups created to spread hate just before surge in Delhi violence: Police probe 
CAPRICORN, You must do everything in your power to resolve a dispute in a close relationship. Don't allow partners to think you are totally self-obsessed and don't let them walk all over you, either. A relation you haven't seen for some time could have interesting news for you - so get in touch. AQUARIUS You would like to be in a position to know a great deal more. Wouldn't we all? But, now that the facts are so difficult to get at, we all have our own version of the truth. Yours is as good as anybody's, so lay your ideas on the line and wait for partners' reactions. 
TAURUS, Taurus: It is said that more haste equals less speed. Never has this paradoxical statement been more relevant to your circumstances. The more you push, the faster you are likely to drive yourself into a very thick fog! Take a little extra time to figure out the facts. Read | PM keeps all guessing: This Sunday, thinking of giving up SM accounts 
GEMINI, Gemini: You're still walking a financial tight-rope, so take care unless you are more than one hundred percent sure of the outcome. Romantic stars, on the other hand, have seldom looked better, perhaps because you're prepared to accept whatever happens with a good grace. CANCER Cancer: Nobody can prevent you from doing what suits you best. Neither will they be able to force your hand, especially as far as professional developments are concerned. It's time to show your new-found maturity, impressing partners with your ability to take magisterial decisions. 
LEO, Leo: Just one piece of general advice for the week is to avoid battles of issue and principle. You will all too easily be sucked into some sort of fanaticism in which everyone is sure of their cause and nobody listens to anybody else: so what's new?! Also Read | Screening stepped up as coronavirus reaches Delhi and Hyderabad 
VIRGO, Virgo: You're not always known for your ability to look on the bright side, so may I remind pessimistic Virgos that the long-term cycle is deeply auspicious and that in just over twelve months you'll enter a period of truly awesome good fortune. Can you wait? The answer is - you must! 
LIBRA, Libra: Sometimes the pressures other people pile on you become too much. Nobody will blame you if you choose to give up. If I were in your shoes I'd opt for a quiet week and let others get on with making whatever sort of mess or muddle suits them. And then I'd let them clear it up. Read | Iran speaks out: Condemn wave of violence against Muslims in Delhi 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There's always one planet or another helping you along, and today the Moon is coming to your aid, but to receive help you must acknowledge that partners are right and you, horror of horrors, may be wrong. Difficult as it may be, you might now have to admit to a mistake. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Your horoscope is curiously arranged in such a way that when the stars are urging you to take a financial risk the auspices show great problems! May I therefore advise you that only the safest purchases should be considered today -I mean necessities rather than luxuries. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Looking on the bright side, there's nothing that can go wrong at home that you can't deal with. A relative may break down in floods of tears. The plumbing may seize up - you name it! Try to maintain a sense of humour. And bearing in mind that nothing is inevitable, deal with problems before they arise! AQUARIUS Aquarius: Domestic chores and family meetings may offer a respite from the seemingly bizarre events of the week. Some of these may be imaginary but others may take place in real life! As it happens, this is an ideal moment to take the lead socially - to organise a cultural outing, perhaps? 
TAURUS, Taurus: Something's going on - but what? The whole tone of the week is likely to be coloured by a vague feeling that some sort of major event is looming, but you'll be unable to put your finger on the details before next weekend. In any case, you're in a strong position today, so with a little effort in the right places, you'll make the most of it.

GEMINI, Gemini: Your financial stars are so finely poised that you could make a fortune, but one false move and you'll lose the lot. I've spelt out the risks, so it's up to you whether you go ahead or wait a while. You'll probably feel more confident tomorrow, but guard against complacency. CANCER Cancer: You're now following your stars through the middle stages of a cycle of growth, opportunity, and expansion. Looking at the long-term, you must now consolidate. In general, the time for revolution is over, although you can spring a few surprises over the next three days. 
LEO, Leo: You have so much to offer. In fact, this is your time to save the world. Or at least, that's what you may think. First, you need to make sure that you actually know what other people want. Keep secret ambitions under review. It may soon be time to break your cover and make your intentions clear.

VIRGO, Virgo: Although there's still plenty of time to make professional plans and steer other ambitions back on course, the time for glory may have passed, at least for a little while. Your romantic stars are heading for a burst of brilliance in a couple of weeks' time, so you can begin to fill up your diary. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your ability to reconcile rivals and hold different factions together is one of your undoubted strengths, but this week you must calculate whether your peace-making efforts will be worth it. You've got some pretty strong opinions today, but that doesn't mean that you're always right! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: All Scorpios in any way connected to the travel industry or educational world have a great deal of potential, but must play their hand cautiously. Every single one of you must watch out for legal complications this week. Plus, of course, you're busy catching up with jobs that should have been finished a long time ago. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Sometimes you have to yield to a superior force, if only temporarily. Unfortunately, you are no longer in any position to lay down the law or force the pace. There seems to be a tiny matter of an issue of principle to sort out first, although a less promising week for getting to the facts cannot be imagined! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Deep down you know that the moment is not yet right to burn your boats. Yet with Mars, the fiery planet, intimately linked with Saturn, the planet of limits and boundaries, the symbolism is right for a definite, if rather confused, break. But, of course, you have to do it without letting anyone down. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Optimism at work is one thing but, if you move too fast, then others will be left behind this week. You'll then be on a downward slope of misunderstandings, arguments and eventually a falling out. Take the trouble to explain yourself and keep friends and relations on your team. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Some of you are now pretty tired of a close partner's inconsiderate ways. But what should you do? Should you follow the normal Taurean practice and put up with irritations until they go away? Well, with so many planets in your favour you may take a different approach, tackling such people head-on. Opinion | Tavleen Singh writes: Modi's image as a world statesman has taken a battering since his second term began 
GEMINI, Gemini: Neptune, that most mysterious of planets, is approaching the end of its passage through a special region of your chart, one which rules not just your money, but all joint finances. The only forecast we can make is that your business situation is bound to be even more complicated than in the past! CANCER Cancer: Get into gear now and you'll be ready to make the most of your brand- new astrological cycle. You're bound to concentrate on domestic activities and aspirations at first but, by the end of the week, you'll be focusing on work, where it looks as if conditions will be more complicated than usual. Read | Justice Muralidhar Empathetic, fair, and honest to core 
LEO, Leo: Even though some of your affairs seem to have been thrown into reverse, you should remember one thing: in no circumstances should you take a back seat now, or allow anyone to push you into second place. There are challenges to be met, but also a great many glittering prizes to be the reward of those who come through on top. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You are beginning to share a number of characteristics with Pisces, your opposite sign. This is all rather strange, because sensitive Pisceans are often so different from sober Virgoans, yet with an enormous build-up of planets pointing at your house of dreams it is time for you to transform your life and liberate your imagination. Amartya Sen interview: ‘Crackdown on protests shows govt's brutal claws, leaves it open to ridicule' 
LIBRA, Libra: Have you considered going away sometime soon? We can forecast pretty firmly that you will enjoy yourself, meet new people and feel much more energetic than if you stay at home. One word of advice, though: please double-check all instructions and directions before setting off. There's a discovery waiting for you, but where and what only time will tell. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: This is a classic moment. You're at your most secretive - so much so that perhaps you yourself aren't even sure what you're up to! Yet you're very public about your feelings, and you may even be making a drama out of a relationship! You must take as many short trips as you can, visiting as many different environments as possible. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You should be on top form, thanks to your own efforts as much as to any good fortune that fate is bringing your way. This is no time to wait at home for the phone to ring, hoping that other people will contact you. You must seize the initiative and arrange social activities and meetings. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There's so much planetary activity that it's difficult to separate what is important from what is completely irrelevant. However, the critical factor is probably Mercury's rapid movements. This means that you'll be changing your mind on important matters, cancelling major engagements and meeting delays in all your plans. Opinion | P Chidambaram writes: BJP wants people with different opinions to harden their positions AQUARIUS You're building up to the next great lunar alignment in two weeks' time. I won't pretend that everything will become clear around then. In fact the reverse is true, and questions which you thought were about to be answered may grow ever more obscure. Life, you might guess, is about to become even more weird than before. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Hopefully you will now be able to make a once-and-for-all break with the somewhat dubious habits of the past. I say that now because you are almost at the very end of a series of emotional planetary patterns that can be traced back over recent months. 
GEMINI, Gemini: You've got some pretty strong opinions, but you've got to think very carefully before you try and persuade other people that you're right. You'll be stimulated by long-distance travel, but even if you're forced to stay where you are, you'll still have your dreams. CANCER Cancer: Business and pleasure come together in unusual ways. It's time to crack open the piggy-bank and squander your ill-gotten gains. If you're socialising tonight, be prepared to pick up the tab. If you have declarations of love to make, go over the top. 
LEO, Leo: The chickens should now be coming home to roost, in the nicest possible way, of course. In fact, some of your past actions will shortly return like so many boomerangs, hopefully in the form of pleasant rewards. You may face a little criticism, but nothing you can't handle. Also Read | Delhi: 60-year-old man beaten to death, toll rises to 42 
VIRGO, Virgo: Several planets are now settling into comfortable regions of your solar chart. In fact, the auspices, as you will shortly find out, are in many ways looking excellent for the next twelve months. Optimism and faith in the future will be your greatest qualities. 
LIBRA, Libra: Push the boat out and enjoy the fact that the Moon aligns with your house of lovers as Venus and Mercury lift your spirits and send messages to your house of friends. However, when it comes to cash questions, your mood will change, becoming rather more serious. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There are pleasant indications of a helpful family period. However, you may also be seized by a desire to get away entirely and pursue a personal ambition free from all restraints. With a bit of careful handling you'll get your way and upset nobody. Also Read | Foreign Secretary dashes to Kabul as Taliban, US sign pact today 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: A rough count of your planets shows that they are split between those which favour fun and others which either urge more work or are undecided. That looks to me like a recipe for relaxation. Even serious choices and issues may be safely put to one side while everyone digests the latest information. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Extravagant stars continue. The question is, then, are you going to buck the trend or follow it and surge into the red? The choice is yours: nothing is set in stone. Plus, travel plans may have changed, but it honestly doesn't look as if the end result will be any different. Also Read | AAP rethink: Kanhaiya, nine others to face sedition trial AQUARIUS Aquarius: With the Moon aligned with your sign, you have no excuse if anything goes wrong. In point of fact, there are many ways to deal with lingering problems, some of which have not yet occurred to you. Use your power wisely and include the restoration of frayed relationships amongst your goals. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Your chart retains its profoundly ambitious complexion, which means that this is a period to go for broke. You surely deserve to come in first in life's great competition, especially after all you've been through. But the most important result should be your rising self-esteem. 
GEMINI, Gemini: 'Think big' seems to be the day's theme. It doesn't really matter whether your grandiose ambitions ever see the light of day, or if they're doomed to failure, just as long as you make the effort. What's really important at the moment is that you learn from your experience.

As it happens, there's nothing much to worry about, as the most reckless and foolhardy planetary patterns should pass you by unscathed. All you have to do is stay cool. 
LEO, Leo: Meteorological metaphors make sense at the moment, in which case it looks as if you're in for your very own emotional hurricane. However, as always happens at such times, there's a cosmic task, and right now it is to see the world through a partner's eyes. Opinion: Events in Delhi have taken a high toll. Apex court and government must act urgently 
VIRGO, Virgo: Happiness, it is said, comes from being totally involved in what you're doing. The whole point is to keep busy, otherwise you'll lose control at a vital moment. Do try to get away for a spot of quiet contemplation, remembering to make time for yourself as and when you want. 
LIBRA, Libra: Today's stars are all about pleasure. I know that's a difficult concept for many people, but as a Libran you should set the example when it comes to a spot of harmless self-indulgence. You'll have a few personal choices to make later on, though. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The level of emotional intensity is likely to take a slight move upwards, but not to nearly the same degree as some weeks back. If you want to put your talents to good use, help a family member over a rough patch. And don't wait for them to ask.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Your next emotional cycle begins here and, if you know what's good for you, you'll seize every opportunity to enjoy yourself. If you want a justification, well, you need a pleasurable break as much as anyone. If interviews or serious discussions are underway at work, the signs are excellent. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: When all is said and done you really do have a great deal to be proud of, and today looks like a moment for rewards. At the very least it is time you gave yourself a few treats. Try not to count the cost, at least not if it means you have to decline a grand opportunity. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Partners may be over-bearing. I know that. You know that. But do they know it? Frankly I doubt it, in which case your best plan might be to keep your feelings to yourself, ignore their self-opinionated ways and appreciate their generosity and good points. 
TAURUS, The Moon is now swinging into a position which is unhelpful, though necessary. In other words, you may have to take a good long, deep breath and resign yourself to doing something you thought could be put off, perhaps for good. It might actually be much easier to deal with than you thought. 
GEMINI, The whole future is now looking very much brighter, especially if you are angling for adventurous solutions and opportunities. My one word of advice would be to keep an eye on the legal angle, lest you overstep the mark. The last thing you should do is upset people in authority. Opinion by P B Mehta | Our republic cannot become what our rulers want it to be CANCER All financial sectors of your chart are now looking dynamic, and also a little stressful. The conditions are therefore ideal for a break with the past, but first you will have to bail out of one particular commitment. Try to set yourself free without letting other people down. 
LEO, Partners have shed tears of joy as well as of sadness. In fact, you have achieved much that is worthwhile. Continuing in a generally celebratory mood, now looks like a good moment to pull out all the stops, aim for the very best - and thank your lucky stars!

VIRGO, The Sun, Mercury and Venus are a pretty lively trio of planets, but some features of your chart indicate that you may be in a languid or lethargic mood. If you try to force the pace, then you may overlook certain vital details and get off to a false start. 
LIBRA, You may still be determined to keep yourself to yourself, but do let everyone know what you're up to. Does that sound contradictory? If so, it's because you can now have your cake and eat it. Remember, though, to say only the right things to the appropriate people. Opinion by Najeeb Jung | Minorities in India are coming to believe that there is a campaign to make them second-class citizens 
SCORPIO, There is a great deal to be said for looking more closely at family relationships. If you suspect that someone is holding something back, why don't you take the initiative and get them to talk about it? You might find that they're relieved that you've raised uncomfortable questions. Also Read | Nitish resolution against NRC, Tejashwi in loop, ally BJP not

CAPRICORN, Those two mighty planets, Saturn and Jupiter, have such a long-term role in your chart that you sometimes fail to notice their daily impact. However, right now you should latch on to any unusual ideas, especially if they're unashamedly romantic, or just plain weird and wonderful.

GEMINI, Gemini: A generally businesslike mood dominates the day, so everyone is going to keep coming back to what they see as 'reality'. The fact is, though, that what was true yesterday is not true today, a statement which should make more sense to you than to most other people. CANCER Cancer: Tolerance and flexibility are probably your most important qualities at the moment. It may not be easy when you can see that other people are wrong, but you must give them a chance to explain themselves. You may even, heaven forbid, have to stand back and let them do their worst before you step in. 
LEO, Leo: Here you are with the Sun fulfilling one set of celestial conditions, Mercury and Venus another. The best possible outcome is a spate of fresh invitations. Lost letters may be found and delayed information may arrive, which should be some consolation. Also Read | Delhi violence: Chand Bagh and Bhajanpura  Adjacent colonies at war until RAF rolled in 
VIRGO, Virgo: You may now return to a secret romantic fantasy. This doesn't imply that you'll be escaping from reality, for an astrological perspective decrees that your dreams are vital to your emotional well-being. An apparently time-wasting activity may be anything but that. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your social life is about to improve, but first there are various family matters to be organised. A domestic arrangement should be tightened up, and if you're looking for a firm commitment then you need to mix with the people who are prepared to stand by their promises. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Do give a high priority to all talks and discussions. Communication is vital, so you'll do well to confess all and keep nothing back - within reason of course. What you've got to do is consult the people who can help you, rather than just stand by and watch while you handle new challenges alone.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: A small financial consideration will go a long way towards soothing troubled relationships and raising your profile at work. Only when other people are also taken into account will a domestic log-jam be shifted. It may be that all a partner needs is for you to acknowledge their concerns. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: In spite of the fact that the world is generally on your side, you are liable to be a little over-sensitive. Before you take offence, just remember that it's the Moon which gives you such a thin skin. So, don't jump up and down when someone says something that they don't really mean. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The time will come when you'll have to lay yourself on the line. Ironically, only after you have taken one or two risks will you set yourself up for a very safe and secure future. You may have to reluctantly agree to do something you've been avoiding for a very long time. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Your planets really can't decide what they're doing or where they're going, which makes your astrologer's job even more difficult than usual. Let's just accept that your stars are generally confident, and that you should finish the day odds-on. Also Read | Day after BJP's Mishra warning, how violence erupted across the divide 
GEMINI, Gemini: It's because you had the good fortune to be born a Gemini that you have the right to change your mind as often as you wish. As from this month a whole range of decisions and choices are plunged into the melting pot, much to partners' annoyance. But that's their problem! CANCER Cancer: Go over all financial commitments with a fine toothcomb, and try to spot the deliberate error! This is advice, by the way, which you must follow up to at least well into the next month. Another consideration is that romantic expenses are set to spiral. 
LEO, Leo: Certain old ideas, proposals or suggestions are now due to receive a new lease of life. But your biggest weakness over the next two weeks could be complacency, and if a wondrous opportunity should float past, you must grab it firmly with both hands.

VIRGO, Virgo: You've got to do what's expected of you without sacrificing your own interests. The trick is to perform your daily responsibilities with your usual skill, but avoid being sucked into a mind-numbing routine. There will be a host of little ways in which you can amuse yourself while keeping the authorities happy. 
LIBRA, Libra: Mars is playing a double game, encouraging you to go behind other people's backs now, but planning to bring everything into the open very soon. This should surely be sufficient to encourage you to behave according to only the highest standards. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Your romantic predilections and aspirations are already showing a shift back towards pride and vanity, just for a short period. This means that you will expect partners to have sufficient achievements to justify your being seen with them in public. Also Read | No holy cow when it comes to dissent: SC judge Deepak Gupta 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The best that you can hope for from several of your current stars is a large windfall, the least is the promise of financial reward some time in the indefinite future. The one qualification is that you must rely on your own efforts: luck doesn't come into it. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Your adventurous energies may soon have to be put on ice, but as long as time is on your side, you may press ahead with travel plans and improvements to your personal life. However, one way or another, you should check that there is nothing amiss as soon as possible. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You are about to find that close partners or spouses, can be terribly annoying. It now looks as if someone is about to go back on their word, but the twist is that this time they're likely to be on your side! Hopefully their support will be good for you! 
TAURUS, Taurus: Today's lunar alignments are not exactly restful, partly because your traditional, comfortable habits will be challenged, but also because you might have to shell out a little more money than usual. Yet extravagance is sometimes a cosmic necessity! Read | Look forward to being with people of India, going to be exciting, says Donald Trump 
GEMINI, The same set of lunar challenges to your sign happens once a month, regular as clockwork, though the dates vary. When this happens, as it does today, other people are mysteriously motivated to challenge your feelings and decisions. Listen carefully to their good advice, though. CANCER Cancer: A little hard work never did anyone any harm. The only trouble with your solar chart is that whenever the Moon favours a businesslike routine, as it does now, you are psychologically inclined to irresponsibility! But, then, as people who are familiar with you know, you are a complicated person! 
LEO, Leo: Mercury, the celestial trickster, is playing a new role in your solar chart, rewarding all of you who never gave up hope, even when there seemed no chance of success. Over the next two or three weeks, you will have an opportunity, a slight one admittedly, to right a wrong.

VIRGO, Virgo: Along with many other people, you are about to find that your opinions and attitudes are going to have to change. Any Virgoan survival course over the next month must take into account the need for sincere ideals and spiritual growth. Only the highest standards will do, but then you know that already. 
LIBRA, Libra: Something rather strange is about to happen. The theme for the week is bringing hidden things into the open, revealing secrets and uncovering the truth. You might be rather surprised by what you find, and you may decide to alter your plans as a result. Read | Haryana: Ancient city in Sirsa, under a mound &amp; 50,000 people 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Enough has been said about your professional hopes, and also about any involvement in a partner's ambitions. However, at the risk of sounding like a cracked record I must remind you that from now until another three months have passed, a number of old emotional issues will return to the top of the agenda. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The Moon will encourage you to imagine that the world lies at your feet. There's a certain magic in the air, which lends you the courage and confidence necessary to succeed. As soon as you decide that something should be done, other people will have to fall into line. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Keep yourself to yourself if you wish. After all, nobody has any automatic right to pry into your private affairs. The best way to use your planetary energies is first to have as much rest as you need, and then to involve yourself in activities with a charitable slant. AQUARIUS Aquarius: If you imagined that one particular social liaison had disappeared for ever, think again. There is everything to be gained from reopening old contacts, even those which involve a fair degree of pain or regret. You might soon discover that somebody who you thought never cared for you is really rather well-disposed. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You will benefit from with Venus' discreet contact with your sign. While this is essentially a powerful aspect for all romantic aspirations and connections, you may take a back seat, allowing friends to enjoy the limelight. A little humility and consideration for others will impress loved ones no end. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mercury, the planet responsible for your bright ideas, links with the Moon, symbol of family happiness. There could be invitations, suggestions and random opinions floating through the air waves, and you'll have your work cut out deciding just what you should do. Within weeks you'll be dashing around, rushing from one engagement to another. CANCER Cancer: Those of you who have already taken on major responsibilities will be feeling the effects of partners' criticism. If so, don't sweep your doubts under the carpet, but sit up and take notice. Essentially, energetic Mars will introduce a mood of intensity to your relationships. Someone you haven't seen for a long time will bring good news. 
LEO, Leo: The celestial signs are positive, and you'll be in a prime position to arrange to entertain at home, although the outcome of any family gatherings could be very different from what you intended. There are even indications that you will be considering a move of home. Or perhaps you're just ready for a well-earned change of scene. 
VIRGO, Virgo: The Moon and Mercury, that fabulous pair of planets, support your activities this week, an indication that you'll be under less pressure than at certain times in the past. In fact the imminent build-up of planets in your chart will heap untold benefits on your life and aspirations. All you have to do is make the most of them. 
LIBRA, Libra: Mars is aligned with parts of your chart representing money and partnerships, challenging you to assert yourself in relationships and see to it that partners respect your desire for love and affection. But could you be spending other people's money? Perhaps you'll be lining up some joint investments. Right now a spiky person might have a go at you. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: A fine way to make a success of the future is to clean up the mistakes of the past. There's more than a grain of truth in the claim that your relationships and friendships often fail because you refuse to put in the required effort. If you look at why this happens, you'll see that it's all bound up with your hopes for the future. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Venus will be in a most auspicious position, suggesting that relationships will be going through a popular phase. But it also gives you the ability to present yourself at your best, getting on with people with an ease that you sometimes lack. There could be some extra stress at home, and people you live with are piling on the pressure. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The phase which you're now entering could turn out to be one of the most interesting periods of your life. Nobody is pretending it will all be roses, yet what is certain is that after another few months have passed you'll be much older and wiser. This is a prospect to be relished because it means that you'll be able to live without uncertainty. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You know you're an individualist, and you must have realised by now that this can sometimes generate frustrations if you're forced to obey other people's orders in your personal and public life. Yet if you want to get on in your profession you must heed the necessity for co-operation. You know there is no other choice! 
TAURUS, Taurus: Venus' mysterious motions set a whole series of social events in motion. Be selective about what invitations you accept, and maintain your high standards in all areas. And at work, a generous gesture will be repaid many times over, so do what you can to help those in need. 
GEMINI, Gemini: You will have to listen to others, which could make quite a change! Seriously, though, there is one particular person who will make you see things through a completely different light. But can you be sure who they are? It's easy to misjudge people, so no jumping to instant conclusions. Also Read | US, Taliban to seal Afghan peace deal on February 29, India wary of fallout CANCER Cancer: There is one thing to be said about your current stars - that you should keep on the go. Even your family and domestic planets look lively, so feel free to change your plans. Plus, even though you're still a little sensitive, your emotional survival instincts are good. 
LEO, Leo: Your stars favour high-spending, self-indulgence. Free pleasures are included, so don't think that life absolutely has to be extravagant. And don't let work and routine chores hold you up! In addition, of course, you don't want to see rivals getting their way because of your mistakes. Also Read | Set to lose land for Ram statue plan in Ayodhya, villagers ask why their farms 
VIRGO, Virgo: There are pleasant stay-at-home influences today, but if you are very sensitive to subtle planetary patterns, you'll be brimming with hope for the future. Watch out for differences of opinion and make sure that they don't get out of hand. Perhaps you should try to see what partners really want. 
LIBRA, Libra: Mars' most energetic transits tend to drive all Librans into a frenzy of activity, one at a time. The pattern continues, but with added emotional and romantic complications! Here's a word of advice: settle all outstanding disputes now, so that you have a clean slate for the future. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It is well-known that shopping is a perfect way to cheer yourself up. So, quite aside from profound long-term financial considerations, why don't you just go out and pick up a few bargains? And, how about buying something you always wanted, but never thought was really for you? 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The Moon's emotional presence in your chart reinforces your control of your personal plans today. You'll stamp your mark on family affairs no matter what younger relations may think! Of course, there'll always be people who are difficult to pin down, but you can do your best.

CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Jupiter and Saturn are a fine combination of planets. It just so happens that while one encourages you to take it easy, the other urges you on head-first. You may be musing over what is best for your long-term security, but it's doubtful whether there's any absolutely reliable answer - not yet, anyway. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The business situation looks healthy, but you should be considering other things apart from money. For example, there is good reason to stretch yourself socially. Dance all night if you can! There's an additional interesting development, though: that an old friend is likely to get in touch. 
TAURUS, You are now officially in a long-term creative cycle, good news for all of you pursuing an artistic discipline. The other superb indication concerns increasing possibilities for self-indulgence and treats! If you decide that you want to dance all night, then why shouldn't you? 
GEMINI, If you've been having trouble getting your point across, have another try today. If it's been a younger woman who has been refusing to listen, then the results should be even more dramatic. And when you're socialising, traditional outings to familiar places could be the most enjoyable. CANCER Lunar alignments make this an emotionally supportive day for all Cancers everywhere, partly because the world could feel like a friendly place, as if it's somehow on your wavelength. It therefore follows that with a little goodwill you can get on with anyone. 
LEO, Venus, planet of love, is on your side, advising you to stop and think. You may realise exactly where you are emotionally, which would be useful. If there's someone you want to get in touch with, do it tomorrow. And if there are outstanding questions at work, get the facts straight now.

VIRGO, Secret emotional fears and fantasies are about to take a new twist, perhaps moving one significant step nearer reality. Talk to a loved one and make sure that they share your hopes and feelings. The chances are that your respective positions are closer than you think. 
LIBRA, Financial affairs dominate, with your most prosperous stars encouraging you to accept other people's promises at face value. You don't want to miss out, but neither do you want to be taken for a ride. The choice is a fine one, but there's no reason why you shouldn't get it right. At work, please be more assertive. 
SCORPIO, If a professional relationship has been a little wobbly lately, now may be the moment to make amends. Extend the hand of friendship and see if you can't have a second, or even a third, chance. Loved ones could be feeling more sensitive than they pretend, by the way, so be gentle.

SAGITTARIUS, You are renowned for your grand vision of life and adventurous spirit. However, you're starting to worry about the future. You'll feel a whole lot better after next week's social developments, but until then you may have to take a certain amount on trust. 
CAPRICORN, When we look back at the past, it seems that you really have done rather well. You may now sort out a financial complication. It might be that someone you thought had let you down will turn up trumps after all. And, when they do, you will be able to sit back and take satisfaction in the knowledge that you were right. AQUARIUS You do have a lot on your plate, and I know that it's difficult pressing on alone, but just when you're about to give up, someone is bound to help you out. Emotions will be super-intense, so don't provoke people unless you are prepared for an almighty reaction. READ | Student raises pro-Pak slogans, Asaduddin Owaisi disowns her remarks 
TAURUS, Taurus: It's a businesslike day, so don't waste your time. Mercury is now your most helpful planet, and that's an excellent indication for those who have been having difficulties with children. But, then again, it's also a useful moment for everyone who is young at heart. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The important celestial events this week occur one at a time, so you should be able to cope! Today's significant planets bring the chance for improvements in family relationships and domestic conditions. But they could also bring rising costs in their wake! READ | Babri case accused Nyas head, VHP vice-chief to lead Ram temple trust CANCER Cancer: A very important financial phase is now coming to an end - almost. One last factor remains in play, encouraging you to forge personal connections. Also, a romantic offer may now be back on the table. Should you accept? Well, perhaps - but keep an escape route open. 
LEO, Leo: You're approaching a prosperous and playful phase, and that should be some consolation for the pressure you've been under. Better still, an emotional wound will soon be healed - and not before time, you might say. An employer needs special treatment, by the way, perhaps with a little well-timed flattery.

VIRGO, Virgo: Your current planetary alignments are fortunate, yet they do require a great deal of common sense. Stick to tried and trusted methods, Virgo. In the meantime, let a partner take the strain, for that's the price of responsibility. Also, it could do them good to learn a valuable lesson. 
LIBRA, Libra: You might think you're almost at journey's end, but there's still some way to go. Over the coming months you will begin to discover just what is making a partner tick. What you find out will benefit your work, family relationships and romantic hopes. You couldn't want more than that! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: What you do is much more important than what happens to you. Only when you are absolutely sure of who you are and where you're going will your social life improve. The happy news is that this welcome state of affairs is now only around the corner. Can you wait? Well, you might have to!

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Discretion is essential. The problem is that if you tell people things they're not ready to hear, you may create one or two misunderstandings. A financial matter will be postponed until next week, but that doesn't mean that you can't get on and prepare your ground now. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You have really done rather well, and I think you deserve some recognition for this. Over the coming weeks you will be able to dust down old ambitions and add new successes to existing achievements. Partners will admire your persistence and - at last - back you to the hilt. AQUARIUS Aquarius: You'll start thinking about what you can do to increase your earnings. There's no requirement to do anything, now, so take just as long as you need to consider the issues. A favourite relation needs your backing, by the way, but you have to be fair and even-handed. 
TAURUS, Taurus: The financial situation, by the way, is looking hopeful just as long as you check every microscopic detail. Before very much longer you will come to be admired for your knowledge and wisdom. But, first, of course, you have to prove yourself, and that could take some doing. 
GEMINI, Gemini: A potent gathering of powerful planets urges you to sort out fundamentals, but also to do things in your way. Children and other relations should therefore fall into line. At least, that's what you hope. But, if they don't, then there might not be much that you can do about it.

In fact, the whole of the coming few months should see you acquiring new skills and experience. Even a romantic encounter will teach you more about love. But then that's what life is all about — learning significant lessons. 
LEO, Leo: Little by little, planetary pressure is easing. What a relief. As the celestial tension lifts, you will be able to stand aside and allow other people to take over where you left off. You don't have to do everything by yourself, you know, especially when you're surrounded by willing hands. READ | 25 broken CCTVs in Jamia's Rs 2.66-crore damage bill to HRD 
VIRGO, Virgo: A whole bunch of planets is soon to shuffle places, so you might be doing a spot of head-scratching as you look around and wonder why everything's not like it was last week. You must take it easy at home, especially if you don't want others to pile the pressure on. 
LIBRA, Libra: The Moon is still on your side. You may therefore expect to get your own way. You can, if you wish, imitate the somewhat bossy qualities of your opposite sign, Aries. A cash surprise is coming your way, but your chart doesn't say how much. I hope you're not disappointed. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There does seem to be some change of mood today, encouraged by the Moon's shifting position. You may reveal a secret, or at the very least share some private information. You will gain credit for your behaviour, even if you have to make one or two sacrifices along the way. READ | Trump visit: Areas near Taj get facelift but will it be maintained, ask locals 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Your planetary trends may not be perfect, but they are still helpful, so be content with your lot. You may give social contacts a high priority today, especially as you might be entrusted with a secret tonight. Your discretion will win a new friend. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There's still an excellent chance for all you professional Capricorns to secure an immediate goal. All Goats everywhere should be diplomatic and polite, even if other people are behaving badly. Remember what they say — two wrongs don't make a right. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Hopefully a loved one is about to change their mind, and hopefully you will be very happy at the outcome. You may apply a little more emotional pressure, but don't push a partner into a corner. They won't appreciate it, now — and they won't let you forget it, later. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Is there any break from hard work? Well, actually, no there isn't! I hope you don't mind, because if you're honest you'll see that all current chores were taken on voluntarily at one time or another. And if you don't like it then it's a lesson to you to say 'no' in future. 
GEMINI, Gemini: In spite of life's little ups and downs, today's background patterns convey a sense of relief and an ability to relax. Artistic and creative Geminians should now begin to get ready to enjoy themselves! Remember what they say - all work and no play makes you very dull indeed.

Mind you, they might expect you to make it all right again! 
LEO, Leo: Mercury, planet of communication, is teamed up with Jupiter, ruler of wisdom. What a splendid combination that is. Don't ruin it by taking the world for granted. And, at work, listen to the experts - before it's too late! Actually, there is fun to be had, so don't pass on important invitations. Read | Before he quit, Lokpal judge sent 3 letters to chief on lack of work, and gaps in processes 
VIRGO, Virgo: Forget your daily chores. Forget the need to pay the bills. Forget all those difficult people. Today's planetary patterns speak of wisdom and enlightenment, of love and passion, so look to your heart and prepare for the future - and pay top attention to family pressures. 
LIBRA, Libra: There's a ninety percent chance of an amazing social invitation. But that's not all, for there's a ten percent chance that such an invitation will change your life for ever. So, don't turn down any offer without careful consideration. Remember, the future is bright. 
SCORPIO, Have you ever fancied being the boss? Well, happily your stars are giving you a kick up the professional ladder. Even retired and leisured Scorpios are bound to feel the celestial benefits. Those of you pursuing romantic hopes, though, could find your costs increasing. Hopefully it will be worth it!

SAGITTARIUS, There's a very particular and special celestial formation today. What is so unique is that a wonderful planetary alignment, signifying great good fortune, comes and goes very quickly. The trouble is that other people may not be saying what they mean, so have your wits about you. 
CAPRICORN, Like all the other twelve signs your stars contain much that is fortunate, but luck itself will prove a very elusive quality. You are due to come into some money but, whether it's a tiny amount, a medium quantity, or a huge pile, the stars won't say. At least, not for now! AQUARIUS Pride comes before a fall, as they say. It's one thing to take pleasure in your achievements, but please don't make the very serious mistake of being smug! Make this a day for generosity in all things. And challenge partners who have failed to keep to their word. 
TAURUS, Taurus: This is a proud time for you, so if you feel you have good reason to show off, get on with it! Your family stars are buoyant, and you should receive much pleasure from younger relations' success. Let's face it, it's nice when others do well. 
GEMINI, Gemini: There are people who accuse you of talking too much, or who criticise you for always changing your mind. You may just have to ignore such types over the next few days as the stars urge you to say what you like, when you like and how you like! On the other hand, there's no point in upsetting people needlessly. CANCER Cancer: Do speak your mind today, especially if people at work are missing the point. You should be able to explain yourself very clearly at the moment, and even when you feel that you're not getting your message across, I think that partners will get your essential drift. 
LEO, Leo: Just to bring you up to date on the week's emotional ramifications, it now looks as if you are about to make a very pleasant romantic discovery. First, though, you must complete a trip down memory lane. Was there something said in a letter or phone call that you haven't yet properly digested? I think there might have been. 
VIRGO, Virgo: This is an ideal moment to make a fresh start in all areas of life, partly because one stressful cycle is going to be leaving you alone for a while. Actually, you may focus on anything concerning family relationships and affairs of the heart. A fresh perspective is also called for in a financial matter. 
LIBRA, Libra: You may be concerned by just how future events will work out, which might not be a bad thing if it helps focus your mind on loose ends which need to be sorted out now. A professional burden should be lifted very soon, but you may not be able to work out yet which is the right way forward. All should be revealed in its proper time. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You should accept that everyone has the right to their point of view. You may soak up as many different opinions as you can over the coming weeks, and understand that truth invariably lies in the eye of the beholder. Some people just refuse to agree with you, no matter what, but that is their problem! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Forget the Monday morning blues: the sensible Sagittarian will be up at dawn, ready to take the world by storm. There's a cash bonus out there waiting for whoever reaches the finishing post first. However, you must be very careful to check all details yourself: there is no alternative! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Inspiration is the key at the moment. If you pursue ideals rather than self-motivation, you'll gain. Once other people have realised that you have their best interests at heart, they'll be on your side. It's just a question of winning them over in the first place that presents the problem! AQUARIUS Aquarius: Venus, planet of love, is about to do a strange 'U' turn, salvaging one special emotional situation. In the meantime, you may afford to bide your time, making plans in secret. A child or younger person needs your support, perhaps because the pressures of the past are making it difficult for them to cope with the present. 
TAURUS, Taurus: If ever there was a moment to look way beyond all the current bickering, this must be it. You're approaching a period when the often neglected spiritual side of your life will be of steadily increasing importance, so don't allow anyone, no matter how close or important, to cloud your vision. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Jupiter's lively passage through your chart has tended to make you a little over-trusting and self-confident with the result that you may now have cause to regret a wasted opportunity. However, the loyalty and devotion of at least one close friend or associate must by now be making you feel more secure and optimistic. CANCER Cancer: You currently have a much better idea of where your loyalties lie as well as an appreciation of all that other people have done for you. It's probably in your interests to stop worrying about personal matters and face up to the realities of your career and professional ambitions, especially if colleagues are relying on you. 
LEO, Leo: Commonsense, coupled with a sense of humour, will enable you to turn even rejection to your own advantage by revealing to one and all what a truly caring and generous person you are. Watch out for lunar alignments at the end of the week, which will be your most volatile and risky period. Use your opportunities wisely. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Lunar patterns make it almost inevitable that a choice you've been putting off concerning the balance between your home and professional life will have to be taken very soon. You just can't carry on pretending that you can complete every task you've taken on, so make cuts where necessary and concentrate your energies where best. 
LIBRA, Libra: Venus's passage through your chart should by rights herald a contented and uncomplicated time. However, there do seem to be one or two areas of confusion involving a misunderstanding at home or an unresolved domestic mystery which could prove awkward at the beginning of the week. Try to remain calm and avoid risks. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Decisions that you take around the beginning of the week will have dramatic results in your personal life before long. The key days are Wednesday and Thursday, when you'll be considering making a completely fresh start in both private and professional matters. The problem, though, is how to put your dreams into practice. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You're not normally a secretive person, yet when a group of planets congregates in intense regions of your chart you may have good reason to keep certain important matters to yourself. There seems little doubt that you will benefit from keeping your own counsel until after the end of the week. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Saturn, the planet of authority and structure, is in a helpful mood and you can expect a period of great honour. You can be sure that, over the next few months, people in all walks of life will come to respect you for your maturity, wisdom, skill and experience. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Magnetic Mars' celestial patterns create an explosive situation and, with the added impetus of head-strong Mercury, you'll be in no mood to watch your tongue. You know that your ideas must be listened to and it might be that the time for compromise has passed. Much depends on whether you are prepared to risk a confrontation. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You could be at your most persuasive. This really is a sociable day and you should make great play of your ability to bring people together. Prospects for those in the property market are distinctly better than average but, as usual, your planning has to be perfect. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The various relationships between Mars, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter are perfectly optimistic in their inclinations, and should suit you down to the ground. This is a time to get on with your favourite tasks, to exchange information, make short trips and generally chase your special ambitions. CANCER Cancer: Your particular brand of sensitivity is one we could all learn from. Powerful emotional alignments suit your mood and may encourage you to put yourself on the line as far as one special relationship is concerned. You'll need all the courage and confidence at your disposal. 
LEO, Leo: Slowly but surely you ought to be reassuring partners of your loyalty and dedication. The lesson to learn at the moment is that partnerships must be worked at. This simple truth is quite compatible with the fun, pleasure and enjoyment that come from special associations. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Other people hold the key. It doesn't matter whether your speciality is a working partnership, a romantic liaison or just friendship in general. All that is important is that you open your heart. Once you do that, then other people may respond in the ways that you always hoped they would. 
LIBRA, Libra: What you can do now is take a much firmer line with children. You should also realise that there are many chores to be completed and tasks to be done, even if you are in the mood for a day off. Your best approach is to call in a long-forgotten favour. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: As the Moon moves to and fro between challenging regions of your chart and harmonious ones, the chances for romantic happiness improve. You should seize the opportunity to enjoy yourself, regardless of whether your interests are high-brow or low. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Once again, home and family affairs occupy your attention. It may be a day to indulge in your favourite practical tasks, or to enjoy the company of your favourite relations. Friendly communication with everyone is the top theme for the next twenty-four hours. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There is a great temptation to talk about subjects of which you know nothing. If you can get away with a bluff, do so by all means. On the other hand, if facts are important, you may care to get a second opinion. That's especially the case if you're risking your own cash. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The time has come to clear the decks, as I think you know. As long as you have major personal matters in hand, you may indulge a financial whim. If spending plans are your top priority, then it looks as if frivolities may be a better buy than necessities. 
TAURUS, Taurus: If a promised move of home or major domestic change is held up over the next six months, the reason is that you should stay where you are and address fundamental questions. It may be that you need to work at a current relationship. Or it's possibly that solid repairs and substantial building work are necessary. Which is it to be? 
GEMINI, Gemini: I don't think that anyone should tangle with you at the moment. If they do, they must reckon on the fact that you're in a martial mood, and that you will therefore undoubtedly give as good as you get. You are not about to give way gracefully if there's no reason to do so.

You may now like to consider other questions, like where on earth you're going to go on holiday this year, if anywhere. You see, the important connections seem to lie a long way away. 
LEO, Leo: You can make great strides forward at this time. Hopefully personal matters may be put to one side. In that case, you could direct your thoughts towards the financial situation. There are indeed purchases to be made, but savings seem more perfectly to suit your mood. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Your role and purpose must be to renew bonds with individuals who have drifted apart. The chance of a dispute at work can be postponed with some fancy footwork and a few words of reassurance. The fact that a partner may be feeling uncomfortable with current arrangements is enough to encourage you to look at how they can be improved. Also read | Sanjeev Chawla: The man who knows too much 
LIBRA, Libra: Did you know that you have a reputation amongst astrologers for being lazy? Actually, I think you are misunderstood. The fact is that at times like these you quite properly resent tasks which are beneath your dignity. You don't like to waste your talents. It's as simple as that. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Your partnerships are not always straightforward. This you know well enough. Your long-term task now is to simplify all family relationships, get down to essentials and strip away the waffle. You might have to wait while a partner gets their act together, though. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Given that you may have to delay decisive moves at home, you may still do your bit to improve your lot. Your strongest emotional contacts are with family members or people you live with and, if you recognise this simple fact, then a number of problems will disappear.

CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Do get on with plans, proposals and intuitive ideas. If you talk to people today you should find them sympathetic listeners, and this knowledge may encourage you to confide feelings you'd normally keep to yourself. But don't tell them anything that might cause embarrassment. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The heavy hand of Saturn is now a semi-permanent influence on your life, but I must say that it is a very favourable one. It could bring eventual security, even though today you may have doubts over your financial future. You'll get your way through cautious and consistent planning. 
TAURUS, Taurus: The period you are now entering will put amazing pressure on you to move home. I'm talking, by the way, in terms of a time-scale of at least six months, but the point is that any premature decision will either not come to pass or be severely delayed. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Long-buried feelings and desires should come to the surface, and quite right, too. This is a positive phase, favouring all long-term adventures and far-flung possibilities. Integrity is a must. The moment your standards slip, then your plans will begin to come unstuck. Read | Happy Kiss Day 2020: Wishes Images, Quotes, Status, SMS, Messages, Pics, Shayari, Greetings and Photos CANCER Cancer: You must be at some pains to point out that obstacles are not your responsibility. However, if you can possibly also spread the word that you are not solely to thank for a number of favourable moves, and that other people should share the credit, then your humility will eventually be rewarded. 
LEO, Leo: Please don't imagine that you have been passed by. There is enough in today's stars to indicate that should you accept first that cooperation is vital, and second, that other people's feelings should be taken into account. In other words, selflessness wins the day! Read | I believe that fashion should be democratic. It cannot be only for the rich or the super slim: Wendell Rodricks 
VIRGO, Virgo: There's still no let-up at work. In fact, there is every indication that life is about to get even busier. Please don't grumble, for consciously or unconsciously, you are inviting fresh responsibilities and letting yourself in for extra hard work. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your romantic and social prospects are not perfect, but you're ninety-five percent there. Do give all personal contacts, from the most intimate liaisons right down to casual meetings, your fullest attention. The last thing you want to do now is make a slip that will upset someone who matters to you. READ | Wondering what to wear this Valentine's Day? Take cues from B-town celebs 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Everything that I have said about the potential for change at home continues, yet in a far more intense fashion. If I were you, I'd wait until the dust settles before acting on current feelings. Perhaps, though, you can press on with small and unimportant plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: If you're holding discussions, conducting a debate or attending an interview, well done: you are absolutely and totally in tune with your stars. In any case, please do make a point of sharing all your desires, hopes and plans with everyone who is concerned, however remotely. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The financial indications are contradictory, but I'd say you're in with a better than average chance of a windfall. The important point is not to get bound up with the details of income and expenditure, but to resolve to deal with money better. A positive attitude now equals prosperity in the future.

At work, at home, in love and in business, this is the day to make a fresh start. Psychological and material spring-cleaning should be comprehensive, thorough and all-embracing. Leave no stone unturned. 
TAURUS, Taurus: I am sure that a loved one has been all too ready to pursue a cavalier approach. It has been easy to dodge personal issues by immersing yourself in work or some other worldly ambition, but perhaps you do now need to face up to intimate, deeply emotional questions. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Push yourself to the limit. The best estimation of your prospects indicates that you must make up for lost time in addition to coping with fresh responsibilities. Don't fall back on old excuses to avoid facing your destiny. Have courage, Gemini! Also Read | Diminishing returns in states for BJP's hard ideological push CANCER Cancer: Certain doors may now have to be closed. I am not telling you to turn your back on opportunity, but I do think that you should be more selective in future. Concentrate your energy on areas which are bound to bring success, and avoid time-wasting offers. 
LEO, You are almost certainly unaware of deeper planetary movements which are even now affecting the most hidden recesses of your psyche. But do be assured that for the rest of the year, authority, tradition and stability are the keywords in your personal life. 
VIRGO, Virgo: There's no rest for the wicked, as the old saying goes. There's no rest for you either, so you may as well recognise that relaxation will be in short supply. Keep your nose to the grindstone and get as much done as you can. The more you do now, the more time off you'll have later on.

LIBRA, Libra: All you have to do is be yourself. Easy advice, I know. I also realise that this may be the hardest thing in the world to achieve, but there's no harm in trying, is there? The general planetary picture is very optimistic, so set off with a song in your heart. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There's been a great deal of talk lately about the need to save face. This is a concept which means a great deal to you, and people you live with had better recognise this. The best way to placate you is to make you feel that you've won - even if you haven't! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Reassuring relationships connect Mars, Jupiter and other helpful planets. In plain language this means that personal relationships dovetail with overseas links. A perfect time for a long-distance trip perhaps? You should certainly pay special attention to all foreign connections.

CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The benevolent planet Jupiter balances the aggressive planet Mars. The result? Well, for a start I'd say you're being set up for an increase in your earnings. Luck doesn't come into it. Instead it's all thanks to your own hard work. Give yourself a pat on the back. AQUARIUS Aquarius: It will be a rare individual who doesn't recognise that every difficulty conceals a host of benefits. There is so much going for you at the moment that you may finally have your cake - and eat it! Other people may be envious of what they see, rightly or wrongly, as your good fortune. 
TAURUS, Taurus: The truth of your situation should now be becoming clear. You may, for example, be about to realise the importance of authority and tradition. At work, there is no way to evade the powers that be. Your most positive approach is to do what you have to for now, and try to turn the tables when the time is right. 
GEMINI, Gemini: You may be about to amaze loved ones with a display of energy. I'm not advising you to be aggressive, but I would like to see you being more self-assertive in the very best sense. Stand up for what you know to be right. If you take the easy way out, then you won't respect yourself - and neither will other people. CANCER Cancer; There will of course be times when you don't see eye to eye with loved ones, but you may head off potential confrontations by biting your tongue, turning the other cheek and allowing people to learn from their own mistakes. That might be the best approach for them as well as for you. 
LEO, Leo: There is no point in advising you to ignore what is happening at home. You may get away with burying your head in the sand now but, if you do, your problems will escalate over the summer. Therefore, you must deal with all those fundamental issues, now. READ | Follow live updates on the Delhi Assembly Election Results 2020 
VIRGO, Virgo: The general planetary set-up indicates that you are still unclear whether to press ahead with your own individual goals or muck in and help out with tasks that are primarily others' concern. The answer is to do what you want today, but do what you have to tomorrow! 
LIBRA, Libra: You should be ready to stand up and be counted. You must also be ready to put your back into achieving special personal goals. Don't ever expect to attain these without putting in sufficient effort. The cosmos just doesn't operate like that. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Astrology is infinitely complicated and today's stars are completely overshadowed by alignments that take place in two to four days' time, so don't be mesmerised by short-term developments. Do yourself a favour by talking about your plans and discussing your hopes. READ | PSA detentions in J&amp;K: One High Court judge quashes orders, another upholds 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius; The moment may have come to spring a few surprises, but there's a supreme irony here. The way you can astound people is by being utterly conservative. Radical ideas are out of date, and traditional values are in - at least for today! Tomorrow may be different! 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Personally, and emotionally, this has been a trying time. Today's fascinating stars vary from being totally superficial to utterly profound. There is no middle way, so don't be complacent. You will have to decide which path you're taking and then follow it through. READ | An Express Series: NRC fears don't cross the divide: among poor Hindus, a confidence, assured sense of place AQUARIUS Aquarius: Don't concern yourself with what happens today. It's the evening that counts, and if I were arranging your movements, I'd advise you to stay in bed until later. It may be impossible to fit in with such an awkward planetary schedule, but do your best! 
TAURUS, Taurus; It's fair to say that your planetary patterns are favourable, all the more so if your inclination is generally inspired, visionary even. The closer you come to practical responsibilities, the greater the need for additional care and caution. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Partners can't read your mind, so tell them what you think. If your aims are professional, and if you're planning a spot of personal promotion you could do worse than set your sights on the next few days. You may just receive a windfall, even if only on a modest scale. CANCER Cancer; The Moon is normally such a sympathetic planet, but today it leaves you in no doubt that it is other people who require your loving care and sympathy. Reach out and offer the hand of support to those in need. They will pay you back in their own way - when they can. Follow LIVE updates on Oscars 2020 
LEO, Leo: There's no escape from busy planetary pictures and hence no way to avoid your responsibilities. The best course may be to get as much achieved as you possibly can in order to give yourself more scope for relaxation tomorrow and the day after. Have a break. Put your feet up! 
VIRGO, Virgo: You may see creative self-expression as a voluntary activity, but the planets don't agree. Today, in so many little ways, you may be compelled to be an individual and be true to your own utterly unique talents. Employers please note! And family members please take care! Read | PSA file indicts Omar Abdullah for getting people to vote 
LIBRA, Libra: There seems little doubt that home and family affairs will dominate your thoughts and feelings today. Even if you are determined to give the highest priority to work, it will be deep and fundamental issues which demand your attention, including your domestic relationships. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Some celestial indications suggest that you may be called away from home, possibly on account of work or a similar responsibility. In any event, the main goal is to communicate clearly and make yourself properly understood. Someone else may owe you an apology, but don't hold your breath! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Business affairs will occupy your attention. Your financial stars are looking considerably less complex than this time last year, and today you may cut across a whole series of irrelevant hangovers like the proverbial hot knife through butter. Watch: LK Advani's emotional response to Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Shikara 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The ball is in your court. Tackle private affairs and deal with professional activities only if you feel a deep personal motivation. Romantic encounters and sentimental journeys are desirable, if only because the results may be much more delightful than expected. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Any feelings of uncertainty or confusion should be short-lived, and by late tomorrow you could be back in the driving seat. In the meantime, remember that you're now into a fantastically productive long-term cycle. The world will judge you by your deeds rather than your words. In pictures | Rainbow flags, balloons &amp; placards: What Gandhinagar's first pride parade looked like 
TAURUS, Taurus: The week's planets are extremely important in terms of your personal relationships, domestic affairs and professional ambitions over the next year. The more in tune you are with your genuine needs and true motivations the better you'll handle whatever life can throw at you. Happily, you will soon receive just the romantic fillip you need. 
GEMINI, Gemini: In a sense, many of your astrological patterns raise the question of finance and how best to deal with both short-term emergencies and long-term plans. Above all it's vital to free yourself from preconceptions left over from your childhood, take control of the present and shape the future. Increased prosperity will be the result. Read | Rajinikanth set to launch party in April CANCER Cancer: Ultimately, although you realise that advancement in your career can only be achieved through unswerving dedication and vigilance, it is your personal life which must now be treasured and preserved. This is why you must not be pushed into abandoning domestic responsibilities and goals, of which the main one is your own happiness. 
LEO, Leo: Your ambitions are due to take off when the Sun, Moon and Jupiter all extend their dynamic presence to positive areas of your life, causing a widespread and long overdue shake-up in both your personal and professional affairs. Until then, why not take advantage of the relaxed planetary aspects to snatch a quick break? Opinion | Tavleen Singh writes:  Delhi's worst election campaign 
VIRGO, Virgo: Romantic feelings often overwhelm you when least expected but, if you are aware of all the possibilities, you'll be in the best position to enjoy yourself to the full. Therefore watch out for the movements of affectionate Venus this week and relish pleasurable invitations, but play down emotional complications. Above all, be optimistic. 
LIBRA, Libra: This week brings the prospect of a major upheaval that much closer, if only because it's time to say goodbye to a number of people and places that no longer have any meaningful role in your life. You are an independent soul by nature, so you should be quite happy to set out on a new adventure, taking life as you find it. Opinion | P Chidambaram writes: Across the aisle: Government is clueless and timid 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Jupiter, that most generous of planets, is giving you the edge required to implement long-awaited social improvements, but unless you move fast you might have to put off your plans until after another few months have passed. Remember that, although this planet always brings rewards, you must yourself be hard-working, cautious and practical. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The planetary formation may not be quite as advantageous as it was in recent times, yet the fact that Jupiter, your ruling planet, is spending the entire week sending helpful aspects is undoubtedly good news. Combined with the presence of a number of planets in your creative solar house, this makes for positive travel influences. In pictures | Amid rumours of Alia-Ranbir wedding, here's looking back at the couple's journey 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: This is an active week and even if you're taking well-deserved time off, you'll be able to rubbish the oft-repeated jibe that yours is a lazy and complacent sign. The tide will be flowing in your direction and all emotional and social adventures can be expected to work out pretty much as planned. AQUARIUS Aquarius: When the Sun, Moon and Mercury form friendly patterns with a selection of planets your special abilities will be much in demand, partly by colleagues at work who depend on your practical skills, and partly by relations and people at home who value your essentially caring and sensitive nature. Even if success doesn't arrive until later, the wait will have been worth it. 
TAURUS, Taurus: It seems more than likely that you will have to wait until tomorrow if you wish to kick-start someone, or something, into action at home. Today is an ideal time to pursue a private fantasy, though. If you find someone who shares your dreams, then you'll be fortunate indeed. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Practical planets maintain a focus on business. Even if all financial issues have been tidied up, there is still a pressing need to be cool and efficient. Cash questions can be delayed, but if you want to pick up a bargain then there's no better time. CANCER Cancer: The magnitude of coming emotional developments is such that you'd be strongly advised to plan ahead. Just for today, good relations with partners are essential. At home, learn to say 'no' to people who see you as an easy touch. But how did they get this impression? From you, perhaps? READ | Follow live updates on the Delhi Assembly Elections 2020 
LEO, Leo: It's an ideal period for routine chores and quick repair jobs. Save tomorrow for the biggest and best social events, and spare no effort to bring people together. Also, look after partners' interests, for there are things which you know that they don't, and experiences you've had, which they can learn from. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Today's planetary picture may not be perfect but it's close! If you have any choice in the matter, change travel plans now to suit your interests. Also, resolve any outstanding differences with children, and talk to younger relations - they might actually have some good advice to offer. 
LIBRA, Libra: Today's personal developments continue what was initiated yesterday. If you can possibly make any alterations or adjustments in family arrangements, please do so immediately. If you leave it too long, then you'll find that other people may be unwilling to change. READ | 61 coronavirus cases on Japan ship, Indian crew in quarantine: ‘We are in fear…we want to leave' 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You're not one to waste your time on small talk. There is far too much at stake to follow up dead ends and emotional cul-de-sacs, no matter how other people beg or plead. Make them see the basic facts first, and let them know you'll listen when you figure out what they're talking about. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Don't think of practical necessities as an unwelcome intrusion into your otherwise adventurous affairs, but as a vital stepping-stone towards the achievement of a very special life-long ambition. Even the most tedious activities can be enjoyable if you'd only change your attitude. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The stars are saying two things; stay busy but spend time with your family. As far as money is concerned, you should think ahead. You may also delay purchases until next week, if you wish. You never know: you might find a better deal somewhere else. READ | Little Women movie review: A near-perfect adaptation AQUARIUS Aquarius: Today's stars are moderately lively - and a little careless. Discretion remains an important quality. It's not only a matter of what you are prepared to say, but what other people are ready to hear. Consider partners' sensibilities before blurting out the truth! 
TAURUS, There's still a shortage of significant planetary patterns, so this is a time for you to make your own choices and not to be pushed by circumstances. Actually, it's a sociable period, and you'll be happy to mix with friends and avoid any feeling that you're stuck with family members. 
GEMINI, You want only the best and you deserve an improvement in your circumstances. It's one thing having high hopes, though, and another to make sure that they can be put into practice. You may be able to rely on people who already have done what you're planning. If they don't offer advice first, then swallow your pride and ask.

LEO, Sometimes you get the feeling that the real action is elsewhere. If you're still wondering where the excitement is, give it a little longer. The whole situation changes before long, allowing all of you to go out and hunt for your heart's desire. And about time too. READ | Detained since Aug, Omar, Mehbooba hit with stringent PSA 
VIRGO, There is a great deal to be said for indulging yourself today. Some sort of treat is in order to lift your morale. You also deserve a reward for all those times you have put yourself out for other people. You may not receive the thanks you're expecting, but appreciation could arrive in other ways. 
LIBRA, You still seem to have enough energy to keep your own plans on the go and inspire other people with your example. As you've discovered, though, if you don't pace yourself and slow down as soon as you hear the warning signals, then you could end up completely burnt out and exhausted. 
SCORPIO, You're still not happy for other people to find out everything that you're doing, so you'll have some fine judgements to make, letting some folk into your confidence, but treading warily with others. And, if you can find some time to day-dream, then go ahead. 
SAGITTARIUS, Any desire to travel widely, perhaps to far-away places, should now be taken a major step forward. If life in foreign parts doesn't suit you, at the very least you should take steps to make your accommodation more airy and spacious. A little extra luxury wouldn't come amiss, either. READ | In speech, PM Modi quotes Nehru, Ambedkar, Shastri on welcoming Hindu refugees 
CAPRICORN, Expect a surprise of sorts. It seems that the consequences of the last few months' actions could be extremely important and will be here sooner than you expect. It is also clear that whatever happens may bring back memories of something that took place around this time last month. AQUARIUS Discretion is vital. Yet it is amazing how much you can give away without telling anyone what is really going on. You have everything to gain from keeping a secret a little while longer. That way the surprise and a partner's pleasure could be all the greater. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Every astrological pattern requires careful handling and right now you need to give family gatherings and domestic duties just a little more of your valuable attention. And remember that old saying: if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing yourself! READ | Ram temple case: Parasaran first trustee, 15-member Trust office has his home address 
GEMINI, Gemini: You will be aware that it's important to be more businesslike, partly because some of your planets are encouraging you to be rather careless and lazy. In fact, to be totally down-to-earth, cash issues will come to dominate. It may even be time for a well-deserved bout of extravagance. CANCER Cancer: You are known for your soft heart and ability to endure all manner of insults. However, if money or material security is involved, the worm is about to turn, so those who are in your debt had better pay up. Actually, there'll be times when all you need is a vote of thanks - and buckets of appreciation! 
LEO, Leo: You will now be able to judge if a gamble has paid off. If you lost out, don't regard it all as wasted effort, for at least your options have been clarified. You'll have a better idea of what to do next time round. Plus, of course, you will be able to help somebody else out of a tight spot. READ | Azamgarh protests: UP police arrest 19 for sedition 
VIRGO, Virgo: It's unclear whether a recent emotional outburst occurred at work or home. It's pretty certain it didn't involve friends, though. In any event, whatever happened in the past, today is a time for principled decisions. Only the very highest standards will do. 
LIBRA, Libra: Let's get down to brass tacks: this looks like an ideal time to exercise your legendary interior design qualities. If you put your mind to it, you can create a much more pleasing personal environment - and you also have a truly wonderful ability to make practical use of a partner's vague ideas. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There's a clear pattern to the day, with financial pressures coming from one direction, emotional ones from another. You may spend some time dealing with shopping, investments and other little deals, but it's your heart which really keeps you going - and the desire to make someone else happy. Arvind Kejriwal interview: ‘People of Delhi have given birth to a new kind of politics — of schools, hospitals, power, water' 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The fact is that even if you don't like what other people say it's probably true. Or, at least partly true. So listen carefully and decide what is right and useful for you. Also, deal with emotional issues as soon as you can. Otherwise a partner may get the idea that you don't care about them. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You will be ruled by your heart rather than your head. In fact, I would go so far as to say that's a good thing! Just make sure that the emotions you express are full of compassion and care for others. That way you're likely to meet with a much more willing response. AQUARIUS Aquarius: By the time evening falls, you will be keeping something important to yourself. Regardless of past emotional tangles, confidences must be respected, so don't reveal partners' thoughts and feelings until they give you the go-ahead. And try trusting a colleague's instincts. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You're still probably in an obstinate and unbending mood. I won't advise you to compromise, for only you know what is best, but I would advise you to be very careful about when you take on a partner in a trial of wills. Only fight battles you know you can win! 
GEMINI, Gemini: There's still a high chance of an argument, but that's a good thing if it helps clear the air. A difference of opinion could actually ease suspicions and fears, because everything will be out in the open, so a flexible, pragmatic and sensitive approach suits your purposes best. CANCER Cancer: You probably feel swamped by responsibilities, but there are indications that an increase in your burden is purely temporary. There is no better time to deepen your involvement in a charitable enterprise, and helping others is actually a great way to feel good. Read | Coronavirus: How did India evacuate over 650 people from Wuhan? 
LEO, Leo: Children should form a more important part of your life. This means that even if they're not making demands, you should still go out and see in what ways you can help, cajole and encourage younger people. You might even draw some fresh inspiration from their attitudes and opinions. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Your daily planetary cycles indicate a very strong emphasis on home and family affairs, but the monthly pattern places the emphasis on work. In love, you have two weeks before a final choice is necessary. The question is, do you want to please yourself - or somebody else? Read | Will Rajinikanth compensate for Darbar's box office loss? 
LIBRA, Libra: Mercury and Neptune are a strange pair of planets. One loves facts, the other lives by its dreams. Yet by a strange series of coincidences they are about to have a very inspired effect on your home and family life. What could be better? Just remember to keep up to date with practical commitments, though, or you'll risk stirring up chaos. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The facts may be against you but that doesn't mean that you're wrong. There are different ways of being right, and you have a feeling for the real inner meaning, even if you have difficulty putting it into words. If other people don't understand you, then that's their problem. Give them time to catch up. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You are being singled out for celestial attention, but that's not always such a good thing. When all eyes are on you, your behaviour must be impeccable, and the result is that you tend to feel a little hemmed in. You'll increase your freedom to manoeuvre with just a little fancy footwork. Read | Nothing called ‘Love Jihad', says MoS Reddy 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The question is not what to do but how to do it. Secrecy may be more advisable than a public display. Also, selflessness is much better than selfishness, even if you do feel it's time you had a fair crack of the whip. Be patient; your time will come - and sooner than you think. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The Sun is currently directing all attention in your horoscope towards activities which are self-satisfying and creative. It would be a shame if you didn't use the current time to achieve something of lasting value. I know other people are putting extra demands on you, but perhaps they can be persuaded to back off - just a little. Read | Yashasvi Jaiswal: World Cup semi-final, Pakistan, unbeaten hundred 
TAURUS, Taurus: It's now time to think about financial issues in great detail. You don't have to be rushed and may leave things at the planning stage if you wish.

GEMINI, Gemini: If life seems like an uphill struggle, all well and good. You should find that, if you put in a super-human effort to overcome all emotional challenges and obstacles, the results will be stunning. If you really and truly believe in yourself then you might even find that other people take you more seriously. CANCER Cancer: It's a day that encourages anarchy, if only in a mild manner, and I'd, therefore, advise the need for self-discipline. If you don't organize your affairs properly now, you'll give someone else the chance to take control. And, if you don't arrange your own time, then you can't complain if you lose out. 
LEO, Leo: A cherished ambition is still at the planning stage, but if you're already on the launch-pad you should get off to a flying start. If you are sure of your ground, you may feel ready to take a risk. See to it that the people who can help you, know what you're up to.

VIRGO, Virgo: Today's planetary patterns are strong enough to encourage sweeping changes at home, even a move of residence. However, this is a passing phase, and your interests will have changed by tomorrow. They'll probably shift further by the day after, so keep an open mind. 
LIBRA, Libra: Your nomadic tendencies will be at a peak, so unless your schedule is fixed and unchangeable, take some time off for a stimulating trip. If you're at work, meetings and conferences will go well. And, wherever you are, try to make extra time for the pleasures that make life worth living. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The fact that one particular person is becoming more stubborn and dogmatic doesn't mean that they're right, but neither does it mean that they're wrong. Listen carefully to what is being said. After all, just because they don't make sense at first, that doesn't mean that they don't have a point.  
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: It's a powerful time of the month, and a moment to remember that even little actions now will be magnified over the coming three months, so think carefully about exactly what it is that you want. The first step could be to sort out the financial implications. READ | Bail to Chinmayanand, judge refers to silence when ‘virginity is at stake' 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: It's a secretive day, but I hope you will be happy if there's a little confusion. A slight muddle may be annoying but will help you bring about the day's romantic promise, perhaps indulging in a little nostalgia. You might also be able to worm your way out of an unwanted commitment. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Security is vital, but the personal situation is looking increasingly changeable. Don't be too concerned if life seems fraught, as very pleasant opportunities will be woven in amongst the difficulties. Besides, rather than being unduly bothered by people who are in a bad mood, you should be able to take the lead and cheer them up. 
TAURUS, (Apr. 21 - May 21 Taurus: It's a week for radical and romantic decisions, a time to be open about your ideas, and not to allow anyone to put you down. You may not be right in other people's eyes, but you know the truth when you see it. You'll only run into trouble when partners are equally convinced that they are correct.

GEMINI, (May 22 - June 21 Gemini: There still seems to be a great deal to be said for keeping yourself to yourself. However, as the Moon reaches a dramatic relationship to your sign, you will be encouraged to spill the beans. If you have a weakness, then it's probably over-confidence. CANCER (June 22 - July 23 Cancer: Venus, the planet of love, inclines you to out-and-out romance, but Mercury, the ruler of communication, means that what you'll really want out of friendships are shared interests and good conversation. Sheer passion may not be enough. But I think you knew that already. READ | EC moves out police officer in charge of Jamia, Shaheen Bagh 
LEO, (July 24 - Aug. 23 Leo: Some of your planets are careful, hard-working and cautious, while others are desperate to be dynamic, reckless, adventurous, optimistic and a touch excessive in all areas of life. As from now, you are to be plunged into a whirlwind of excitement - but slowly. 
VIRGO, (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23 Virgo: Much has been said about your willingness to be walked over and exploited. The fact is that over the next few weeks, perhaps more than ever before, you will be called upon to put yourself out for others. If the stars offer you any advice then it is to help the people who deserve it, and steer clear of those who are ready to take advantage. 
LIBRA, (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23 Libra: Whether at work or at home, it's not only a question of who you know, but how well you get on with them! Above all, you should see to it that a pleasant compromise is reached. You'll get your reward next week. In the meantime, take delight in any good fortune which alights on people close to you. 
SCORPIO, (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22 Scorpio: You'll have to deal with the week's domestic arrangements today, but on the deeper level, it's time to enhance and express your reputation as a healer of the spirit as well as of the body. And, as it happens, your financial stars are also looking fairly shrewd. 
SAGITTARIUS, (Nov. 23 - Dec. 22 Sagittarius: If you don't know what's going on today, and everything seems to be irrational and deeply suspicious, that's only to be expected! Spend a little time getting to the bottom of one particular mystery. You might even find that someone is being terribly reasonable, just for a change.

CAPRICORN, Aquarius: You may devote more attention than normal to developing a co-operative family-like atmosphere at work, and if you're not gainfully employed, press ahead with ambitions to enhance your status in the community. And, at home, take control and try to set higher standards. 
TAURUS, Taurus: If you've any nagging ailments, get back into shape as soon as you can, as life will be much happier if you're physically fit over the coming months. If you find yourself granting too many favours to friends and colleagues during the next week then don't let resentment build up. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Your artistic and creative nature will be enhanced by special celestial alignments during the coming weeks and, if you've ignored this side of your life, now is the time to develop your talents. Those of you with worldly ambitions to pursue will experience a powerful planetary configuration and widespread domestic changes. CANCER Cancer: Your romantic desires benefit from current stars, but you'll have to be prepared to deal with odd problems as they arise. Already this week you may have the sense that the approaching set of lunar alignments will put the accent on domestic changes so now is the time to get going. Budget 2020: Little room to spend, Govt plays safe on fisc, banks on demand 
LEO, Leo: Your planets are busy  and life can certainly be pretty hectic. If you're tied down by work or domestic routine then you really must try and lighten the load. If at all possible, try to take a break and recharge your batteries. Remember that it's your duty to avoid family confrontations and keep relationships on an even keel. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Money hopes should be high, although this may be a better time for making plans and checking out information than actually risking your cash. The chances of a satisfying time emotionally are good and, if you're happily settled, how about considering a second honeymoon? Career chances are being steadily lifted by Jupiter's profoundly helpful presence. Read | Shaheen Bagh firing: Gunman father of 3-yr-old girl, family has dairy business 
LIBRA, Libra: This promises to be a lively time just as long as you take advantage of the stimulating effects of the Sun's presence in your sign. However, with Mercury playing up again, you may find yourself going over old ground, digging up memories from the past or revising some recent decisions. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: True to your secretive nature, you'll be active behind the scenes once again, perhaps helping in a voluntary enterprise, possibly involved in some kind of friendly conspiracy. You'll find it hard to keep information to yourself, though, so don't make any promises you can't keep. Somehow a social phase seems to be coming to an end. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Mars and Venus, a dynamic combination of planets, are in an active mood, so there seems to be no reason why you shouldn't have a profitable week. Legal affairs which have become bogged down require a great deal of patience and effort if you are to secure a favourable outcome. Read | 150 pvt trains on Rlys map; Tatas ‘interested' 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Although major professional questions should be settled, the Sun's strident relationships leave you with the distinct feeling that all is not quite right. By all means continue to investigate certain avenues of experience and reject no possibility out of hand. You may have to wait until the end of the month to hear definite news. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The week favours not just travel, but overseas exploration and adventure. There's no doubt that your mood is expansive but the chances are that you're hemmed in by existing arrangements and will be unable to fulfil much of your potential. Rather than give in to frustration why don't you start planning for the future? Read | UP man kills wife, walks to cops with her head 
TAURUS, Taurus: It's a good day for traditional pursuits, like shopping or dealing with other financial issues, or fixing up your home. The overwhelming emphasis of your planets is on work rather than play, so stay busy. Even in leisure activities, you'll want to do your best. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The Moon now brings a real change of heart in emotional connections which have grown stale over recent times. It will be pleasant indeed to feel more alive again, as the breath of love enters into your psychic arteries. Don't let everyday concerns block or obscure such wonderful feelings. CANCER Cancer: You will certainly require much help and assistance, if only because certain people now owe you a debt of gratitude. If anybody feels guilty about the way they have treated you, exploit it to the hilt! After all, they should have thought about their actions first! 
LEO, Leo: This is one of those rare times when partners must be allowed to go their own way. You will have to learn to trust people, even if your past experience shows that they are likely to make a hash of things. Maybe they have now learnt their lesson! But perhaps you can also offer them the right assistance. READ | Farrukhabad: Man who took 23 kids hostage is killed, wife beaten to death by mob 
VIRGO, Virgo: Your solar chart is certainly a rather special one at the moment. I have spoken about favourable chances and opportunities over the past few weeks. Now, today's Lunar picture will set you a sort of celestial exam to see how far you are prepared to go. 
LIBRA, Libra: You won't be able to make decisive moves financially, or in terms of material security, until after Mercury resolves its current set of changeable aspects. You might imagine that you've all the time in the world, but deep inside you know the clock is ticking away. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You can go into battle over almost any personal matter if you wish, and the chances are that you will win. But winning the war is a different matter, and you should think very carefully before tangling with anyone who you may need to rely on in future. READ | Kunal Kamra ban: AirAsia and Vistara put process above Hardeep Singh Puri's tweet 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The time is fast approaching when no one will be able to impose any restrictions on you, but that's not how it feels just now. Indeed, the typical Sagittarian should be feeling particularly hemmed in by half-understood emotional feelings. Perhaps you need to go back to first principles before you start anything new. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You should take advice from friends and close associates, even on drawn-out domestic dramas. You must also realise that other people do take their beliefs and principles very seriously, so don't expect them to compromise. If they want to be different, then so be it! AQUARIUS Aquarius: If you can accept other people as they are then you will probably get on a great deal more easily than in the past. This is very much a period in which people must all listen to each other with courtesy, otherwise, tempers are bound to fray and arguments will erupt. 
TAURUS, Taurus: You are still having to come to terms with difficulties and opposition created by people you thought were on your team. Perhaps they are still on your side after all, and maybe their criticism is a way of helping you back on to the straight and narrow. 
GEMINI, Gemini: There are a number of mysteries around. Perhaps something valuable will be lost, or perhaps a friend will entrust you with a secret. All should be revealed before long, so spend the day searching for clues. Actually a partner might have just the answers you need. CANCER Cancer: Passive resistance will achieve more than belligerence. Probably you'll find that if you make a point of charming other people, and of showing them how much you can enjoy yourself, their opposition will melt away. You may even convince them that they were wrong about you. READ | Jamia student shot at as 20 cops watch, Proctor says MoS Thakur is to blame 
LEO, Leo: Everything appeared to be going according to plan until more planets began pouring into sensitive and emotional areas of your chart. Now, all your personal and family plans will have to be revised and re-thought. Still, it's good to have a chance to tighten up your act. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Out of a total of ten planets, five are now playing on your side, so you can afford to be more than a little complacent - and confident. You may feel that it is impolite to boast, but at least you should spare yourself five minutes to rest on your laurels. 
LIBRA, Libra: One way or another, you should be ready to bring one economic cycle to an end, but you must also be prepared to take all the important decisions. It may be another few weeks before monetary matters are settled, so don't submit to unfair pressure. READ | Nine-hour hostage crisis in UP village ends: all kids safe, accused killed 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It may be difficult to distance yourself from individuals, places or situations which are churning up your emotions or making you feel undervalued. However, it is not impossible. All depends on a change in your attitudes to your own strengths and talents. 
SAGITTARIUS, Saggitarius: It's a day of work for all Sagittarians everywhere. Even those of you who had decided to put your feet up will have to find some way to keep active or risk the onset of boredom. Even if you're relaxing, you'll do it as well as you can! And don't worry about rumours or gossip. READ | Refrain within BJP: Economy big worry, may spill onto streets 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: There are some disruptive aspects around at the moment, but they probably bother other people more than you. Your main fear may be of destitution or poverty, a deeply-held complex which may have a negative impact on your spending patterns. Actually it can also help you save money - by making you think twice before wasting it. AQUARIUS Aquarius: This is likely to be a confusing moment because while the indications in your chart are all very pronounced, they are pulling in different directions. It may be impossible to decide whether personal promises or public obligations are more important.

TAURUS, Taurus: Most of your current problems seem to stem from a clash of personalities or wills. Yet, with the Moon playing up today, you can probably correct the balance in your favor, and feel a whole lot better as a result. Don't let foolish pride get in the way of reconciliation. 
GEMINI, Gemini: You are likely to be feeling emotionally under the weather. However, the stars are favoring extremes, so with careful attention to exercise and diet, you could very rapidly begin to feel better than ever. Some people say there's no gain without pain, but you may prove them wrong! CANCER Cancer: You're difficult to fool, and you are well aware that others have been deceitful or dishonest, yet there is no reason for anger. Sometimes people just get themselves in an emotional twist, and they probably require your sympathy more than condemnation. READ | Four airlines ban Kunal Kamra for 6 months, rules say 30 days until probe 
LEO, Leo: You may realize that not everyone shares your vision of the future. The most positive way forward at work is to treat employers and colleagues as if they're part of one vast family. Even in the community or similar groups, you should base your actions on the network of emotional bonds. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Some people may be giving you less support than you expected, others may be offering more. In a sense, it doesn't matter, for even if nobody was on your side, you would still manage events to your advantage. I think that everyone needs to recognize your true talents now! 
LIBRA, Libra: As far as personal complaints are concerned, it is a case of least said, soonest mended. There is no point in dwelling on the past, especially as the people who caused trouble may have even forgotten what they were angry about. Besides, if you can't cope with old disputes, how will you handle future ones? READ | Kashmiri Pandits In Kashmir: Those who stayed back have a home — and a roomful of regret 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Let employers and people in authority see that you are not only capable and reliable but also that you have the best ideas. It often takes you a long time to formulate your suggestions, but no matter - you must take as long as you need to come up with the right answers. Other people may just have to wait. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: There doesn't seem to be any sharp line between right and wrong. It's more a question of finding the appropriate course of action. Don't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, or carry on about what other people should or should not have done. The best thing you can do today is carry on with your personal chores with a minimum of fuss. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Out of all the confusion and uncertainty in close personal relationships, something of lasting value is bound to emerge. Today's sympathetic Moon, by the way, opens the door towards pleasurable rewards, self-indulgence and a surprise encounter with the past! READ | Miandad x 2: Rohit brings back memories of Pakistan legend's Sharjah heroics AQUARIUS Aquarius: Someone in a position of power and authority is about to give you a break or champion your cause. It is very important indeed that you offer them a chance to speak, so avoid the tendency to shout other people down. You might even decide that they're right. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Something is going to catch you by surprise, but it may be that what occurs is, in some strange way, a complete non-event. The best thing you can do today is remain cool, calm and collected. Always follow a practical course: it's fine to express your feelings, but don't get swept away by them. 
GEMINI, Gemini: At the moment you need to take quite a lot on trust, mainly at work. You must make a point of delegating important tasks at home, if only because there are now signs that you could soon be worn out and in need of a rest. Plus, of course, it's about time that others did their fair share. CANCER Cancer: The chance to make a major move at work is definitely there, but the window of opportunity is very slight. Do not let financial fears or worries stand in the way of an important ambition. Ask questions and face up to doubts - but stick to your guns.

LEO, Leo: By rights you ought to be flavour of the day, but what is given with one hand may be taken away with the other. Typical! Therefore there may be a fair bit of frustration later on, but there's little point in acting on the basis of resentment, because you might blame the wrong person. 
VIRGO, Virgo: There will be time enough later in the week to restore your emotional equilibrium. You may therefore allow yourself a few risks today, although the only schemes which succeed will be deeply traditional. More up-to-date ideas should be left until you're sure of your ground.

LIBRA, Libra: One set of small cycles is now in a critical phase and you really do seem to have reached a point of no return but, whether this is a bad thing or not, is a complicated matter. In fact I'd say that, if you can put a personal problem behind you, you will do yourself one enormous favour! 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: If there's one thing that's certain then it's that everything is changing. Your planetary positions will be moving on to the point where it will be almost inevitable that you will have to participate in an argument, even if it's not of your own making. Coronavirus outbreak LIVE UPDATES: India plans evacuation of Indians from Wuhan as death toll mounts to 132 in China  
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: All those intense planets are making it rather difficult to work out just what exactly is going on. If you wish to stand around and scratch your head, all well and good. Don't allow partners, driven as they are by today's emotional moon, to pressurise you. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: If there is an opportunity to improve matters at home, a chance to solve a family problem or settle a domestic matter, please move as quickly as you can. Events may be hard to control, but you must do your best. Some people would say that it's not as important to succeed as to try your best. Read | Judge shreds Bijnor police claims: No proof of protesters firing or bullet injuries to cops AQUARIUS Aquarius: In any meaningful relationship both partners must learn to give and take. This principle applies to your professional as much as to your private life, but may be impossible to achieve. Therefore, you should only make promises today if you know you can carry them out. 
TAURUS, Taurus: In spite of recent disagreements over finances, other people should now show their willingness to get on with life as normal. The very fact that Mars and Mercury are influencing your house of marriage, by the way, means that there is no room for time-wasting and waffle in relationships. 
GEMINI, Gemini: There still seems to be an air of mild confusion over career or professional interests. One reason could be that other people have not been entirely straight or honest. Neither have they understood the implications of their actions. It might be up to you to put them right. CANCER Cancer: The best that can be said about recent planetary aspects is that they have taught you the virtues of self-reliance. Now that so many planets are surging through creative regions of your chart, you can afford to enjoy yourself in the way that only you know how. 
LEO, Leo: If you expect to have life all your own way, especially at home, you will be making a very grave mistake. There is a feeling abroad that what is needed is a businesslike arrangement and plain speaking rather than sentimental frills, so don't be caught off guard.

VIRGO, Virgo: There are now few signs of any more financial openings for Virgos, which means that all you can do today is formalise any recent agreements or decisions. Somehow even missed opportunities will present themselves for a second chance over the next week. 
LIBRA, Libra: The Sun's brilliant alignment begins to shift, which means that you may suddenly be forced to abandon certain personal goals and deal with the inevitable costs slightly sooner rather than later. Still, it's best that you do so now rather than leave it until it's too late. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: There is a lot to be said for keeping your distance and maintaining a dignified silence. Only if other people refuse point-blank to honour an agreement should you leap into the fray. As an extra aside, watch out for rising social or romantic costs.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You must realise that for every little piece of self-indulgence there is a price to be paid. Therefore this week you should always make sure that your emotional account remains in credit. It could be favour pay-back time, so return all the goodwill that you've been offered in recent times. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You have had more than your fair share of criticism, complaints and condemnation, and now it really is the time to boost your reputation. Spend as much time and take as much care as is necessary to arrange social engagements. Happiness lies in getting the details right. READ | Minister Anurag Thakur chants desh ke gaddaron ko, poll rally crowd completes goli maaro… AQUARIUS Aquarius: This is no time to be a shrinking violet. You must forget your democratic qualms and realise that you deserve to be number one. Nothing lasts for ever, but you must enjoy whatever glory you can get. Your emotional mood enters a more relaxed phase, by the way, although there'll still be surprises around every corner. 
TAURUS, Taurus: It's not what happens to you that matters as much as how you interpret it. What transpires now should go a long way towards restoring your confidence. Your faith in humanity, though, will suffer if you fall into the trap of imagining that someone close is some sort of saint. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The tables are about to turn! Other people have had their say, but the time has come for you to give them a piece of your mind. Now that Mercury is approaching Uranus, you can afford to loosen up and come out with some of your more unusual suggestions. CANCER Cancer: Both personally and professionally, today should be the perfect moment to pursue your ambitions with consistency and dedication. That does not mean, though, that you should allow yourself to be stuck in an unfulfilling rut. There's always room for improvement, now as much as ever.

LEO, Leo: Seldom will you have been quite so determined to further the dictates of your heart. Yet with so many planets lurking at the very bottom of your chart, you must realise that all is not sweetness and light. Neither should it be. In actual fact, you thrive on a challenge. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Colleagues, co-workers and business associates alike will have to listen to you. There is so much to be said for putting your proposals on the table now - and don't let fast-talking salesmen pull the wool over your eyes. I know the facts are difficult to pin down, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try. Read | The move to transfer Elgar Parishad case to NIA now is wrong. It raises questions about Centre's intent, agency's credibility 
LIBRA, Libra: Your ruling planet, Venus, is advising caution. Actually, you must realise that your emotional fantasy life is especially strong, and that it is therefore necessary to separate your image of other people from the realty. Otherwise you'll set yourself up for a major misunderstanding. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Magnetic Mars and mischievous Mercury are up to their usual games. All you can hope for is that the resulting dislocation between thought and action doesn't lead to a parting of the ways. If you and a partner agree to respect each other's opinions then all should be well. Read | Budget may unveil income tax amnesty on lines of Sabka Vishwas 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: The Moon is in a sympathetic position, so no worries today, just as long as you keep up to date with a partner's changing mood. It is time to allow personal matters to take their course. You must realise, though, that what may seem like a setback now is destined to help you on to the right path. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Matters related to your prestige, status and professional ambitions are still important, but it's no use making a frontal assault. Any attempt to further your interests must be based on the proposition that other people need to be seduced rather than coerced.

TAURUS, Taurus: You may come to doubt the wisdom of one or two rash promises. Your optimism may now be tempered by the knowledge that you'll have to put your fine words into practice. Change your mind. Someone has taken advantage of you in love, but hopefully all that is now in the past. Follow LIVE updates on Republic Day 2020 celebrations 
GEMINI, Gemini: Domestic plans may have to be unmade and family arrangements scrapped. However, please remember that, in the astrological universe, all is for the best and be thankful you've been let off the hook. At home, you will be guaranteed all the help you need - just ask. CANCER Cancer: If it's money you're after, then have one final push towards the end of the week and you never know what will happen.

LEO, Leo: You'll be getting cold feet over a financial venture. It's quite possible that you'll be able to extricate yourself with no damage. Clear up outstanding domestic questions later on. If you should be contemplating a move of home, you should get on and make fundamental plans. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Others may persuade you that for your own peace of mind and security you really do have to make your final choice now. Yet, you have the power to delay for a few weeks, even to drop out altogether. The financial situation is looking bright, although the figures may look gloomy at present. Opinion | Tavleen Singh writes: Celebrate the Constitution 
LIBRA, Libra: The planetary picture at the end of the week suggests you'll be on the receiving end of amazing generosity.

SCORPIO, Scorpio: In spite of contradictory indications, it still looks as if you're about to receive thanks, recognition and acclaim. It's just no longer possible to hide your light under a bushel.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: There are bound to be moments when it seems very much as if you are being kept in the dark, but this is a feeling which many people will share this week. Appreciate your good luck instead of brooding. A relative is accident-prone, and so needs your protection. Give all the assistance you can. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You are gradually beginning to recover from the past few years' worth of tension. Perhaps you can now safely assume that you have won the final round and triumphed over all adversity. Professional Capricorns will shortly receive the acclaim they so earnestly desire and deserve.

TAURUS, Taurus: Others may force you to accept certain terms or arrangements that are not entirely to your liking. However, there is plenty of room for negotiation and partners will be happy to modify their plans if asked. All you have to do is find the right way to approach them. 
GEMINI, Gemini: News received from an unexpected source may make your weekend. However, the only real shocks may arise from the spiralling costs of your social plans, or from other very necessary spending.

VIRGO, Virgo: There is nothing wrong with self-interest, but you are now afforded a tremendous opportunity to show just how utterly selfless you can be when the circumstances are right. It's time to exercise your charitable instincts, doing your valuable bit for the big, wide world. 
LIBRA, Libra: Something or someone is bound to encourage you to take off and make the most of your current advantages. Do whatever you can to attain a greater degree of personal freedom, keeping your responsibilities to a minimum. The last thing you want to do now is over-commit yourself. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You now have a perfect opportunity to confess your real feelings. This may mean apologising to one particular person, or telling someone else that you love them. You owe such honesty to yourself, and you might find that the consequences are much to your liking.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You have studied the information, facts and figures but what is really important is how you feel about particular people or individual issues. Act in accordance with your instincts and hunches, and you may open doors and shed new light on an old problem. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Certain associates seem to believe that they can pull the wool over your eyes. However, gullible as you may be over some things, you are well aware of the true situation and how to make the most of your resources. These people will be surprised when you stand up for yourself. AQUARIUS Aquarius: In many respects this is a peculiar phase for emotional and family ties, but there may be nothing unusual about this. If you want a peaceful day you must take other people's wishes fully into account. Otherwise, they'll badger and bamboozle you until you do. 
TAURUS, Taurus: There is always something to be learned from the most innocuous situations. Now, perhaps, you may understand the advantages of linking your financial future with the fortunes of people who have a better business sense than you. You're still reluctant to let others know everything that's happening - perhaps with good reason. 
GEMINI, Gemini: The overall planetary picture is rather helpful. You are inclined to dream of future riches but there is still a chance that you may inflict upon yourself a series of financial blunders. If I could give you any advice, then it would be to check, double-check - and treble check - all details. READ | Amarinder tip for British actor after ‘1917' remark: Read some history CANCER Cancer: Some kind of a power-struggle is bound to be the result of planetary aspects which in all other respects are highly positive. You need to explore your own limits by issuing challenges to other people: their reactions will show whether you have gone too far - or not! 
LEO, Leo: You should be proud of your achievements, but there are new ways to express your creative potential. What you have to do is find a method of working which allows you to get the best out of your talents. You may also be seizing the moral high ground, answering a question of right and wrong. 
VIRGO, Virgo: The Moon's position today will do much to strengthen your emotional commitment to your own future. It is time to stop putting others first and to think about yourself for a change. If there's any chance of making a break with the bad habits of the past - then take it! READ | Their cases falling, Muzaffarnagar police now invoke Juvenile Act, say protesters used kids 
LIBRA, Libra: The downside of current energetic trends is that you may take on too much and wear yourself out. Some of you are by now planning for as quiet a period as possible, circumstances permitting, of course. You will soon be in a much stronger position at home, by the way. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The Moon's helpful position is bound to lend you greater confidence, especially if you have been suffering from any personal doubts. You must by now be fully aware that you are on the right course, but do other people agree? Perhaps they need to be persuaded. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Emotional involvements and responsibilities should be your priority rather than, say, associations based on work, business or shared hobbies. This way lies greater personal fulfilment and satisfaction. You're entering a more adventurous and assertive phase, so the indications are excellent. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: If you have been holding your peace, the time has come to air your grievances and set the record straight. Be fair, though, and have the self-confidence to admit that the next person's opinions are as valid as your own. The best way to convince the people you live with that you are right, is to demonstrate that your ideas actually work.

TAURUS, Taurus: One aspect of your life to which you may turn your attention is your physical well-being. Get your diet in order and see to it that you are taking appropriate exercise before you find yourself run down and under the weather. In matters of the heart family relationships count for most, so you know where your loyalties lie. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Mercury, the most important planet in your personal scheme of things, is in such a fortunate relationship with Venus that all past differences should now be forgotten. You are at your charming best, especially when you sense adventure on the road ahead. CANCER Cancer: The best you can do with today's planetary alignments is use them to secure approval for your plans at home, whether you are concerned with entertaining or, as seems more likely, with chores and repairs. Basically, it's a brilliant day for keeping busy. Read | Residents of two Valley villages: Army takes our cars at night, no idea why

You will be in line for some more generosity from partners, so stick around. Explained: How Saudi Prince hacked Jeff Bezos 
LIBRA, Libra: Today's stars are very favourable for all short-distance travel, meetings and discussions. Now is therefore the time to put forward your suggestions and proposals in a clear and reasoned manner. It is up to you to get your thoughts organised so that other people understand them. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Something has already been suggested about the prospects for discreet financial arrangements. Today these will move one step closer, but please be generous and try and spread your good fortune around. Younger relations and children deserve your first attention.

SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: This may sound like old-fashioned fortune-telling, but one reading of today's planetary pattern is that all your wishes are about to come true. From a realistic perspective, though, it's all a matter of what you actually want. It also depends on whether you are prepared to put certain preconceptions to one side. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You may imagine you have something to fear from other people going behind your back, but the truth is probably quite the opposite. You, in turn, can help others through your discreet and selfless actions. Also, feel free to spend as much time by yourself as you need. Editorial | SC decision to reinstate employee who charged ex-CJI with misconduct is welcome. Now set up institutional mechanisms. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Venus and Mercury are arranged in a lovely relationship to each other and an ideal aspect with your sign. This is therefore the moment to move on to the next phase of life regarding all new ideas and proposals. In short, it's a passionate period, one when you can pressurise other people into supporting you - if you pick the right time. 
TAURUS, Taurus: There is nothing unsaid which may not be brought into the open. In fact, the more prepared you are to utter various home truths, the more likely you are to earn the respect of your fellows. Not everyone will be pleased, mind you, and you might have to apologise - at least once! 
GEMINI, Gemini: Astrologically speaking the Moon is under your control today. In other words, you have the decisive say in what happens at home. You are also responsible for your own feelings and can therefore blame nobody else if you are not happy with the way things turn out. CANCER Cancer: Your deepest desire will be not only to spend extra time at home, but hide yourself away completely. This is typical behaviour and so should surprise nobody, least of all you! However, by tomorrow your confidence will be growing - and you'll be back in the driving seat. Read | Trump meets Imran in Davos, offers ‘help' on Kashmir issue 
LEO, Leo: Life's normal little complications are bound to continue. However, you may take advantage of the fact that Venus' position is now absolutely ideal for your romantic life, whatever your age, circumstances, experience or inclinations. Go out there and be your charming best. 
VIRGO, Virgo: One of the major issues of the moment is security. However, the stars suggest that more important considerations are emotional happiness and peace of mind, and that might be why you'll be seeking romantic commitment - and testing a loved one's loyalty. 
LIBRA, Libra: A partner still seems to be irritable or short-tempered, perhaps because they're not getting what they want. Unless you are ready to follow a struggle through to a successful conclusion, please try to be just that much more flexible and accommodating over all contentious personal issues. Explained | Three capitals for Andhra Pradesh: its logic and the questions it raises 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The fact that this is a relatively prosperous phase should insure you against the inevitable minor fluctuations in your income and give you the confidence to make more definite plans for the future. One word of warning at the moment is not to push yourself so hard that you end up worn out. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: There is a fair amount of tension in the air today, probably caused by a combination of some people who can't decide what they want and others who are determined to strike extreme postures. People are trying to break free from emotional chains: be patient, and be tolerant. Editorial | India's economic slowdown is largely made of domestic issues. Union budget is an opportunity to address them 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: You have every reason to strike a militant pose, standing up for yourself and defending your own interests. You may have to take on more than one job at once, spreading your talents around. Also, do try to find some time for socialising - you deserve no less. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Keep your nose out of other people's business, no matter how tempting it may be to interfere. There is too much going on in your world for you to dissipate your energy on other people's affairs. Instead you should concentrate on getting your own life together. Read | How a shop-lifting episode saw whipping boys Japan make World Cup cut 
TAURUS, Taurus: You have little real reason to feel hurt or betrayed, the reason being that you are as responsible as anyone else for the direction that events have taken. The solution is to be more aware of your own motives in future, for self-awareness leads to self-discipline, and great success. 
GEMINI, Gemini: It is pleasant to be praised by people who are more accomplished than you. The way forward lies in restoring old friendships, thanks to Venus' dominant position. Try to focus on the bigger picture - on what partners actually mean, rather than on what they've said. CANCER Cancer: The overall planetary position is calm, yet these are still exciting times for Cancerians. Therefore, you can, indeed must, continue to push for the fulfilment of your personal ambitions with no hint of compromise. And if you meet major obstacles, slow down, pause for thought and then redouble your efforts. Read | ED arrests Robert Vadra aide, says bank records link to laundering, property 
LEO, Leo: The real key to current twists and turns lies in a dimension of astrology more subtle than that revealed in your solar chart. The really important developments are not yet clear, and that's why you should tread with care, caution and consideration for your companions. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Many of you have not had much luck communicating clearly in recent months - all of you can point to some situation or other where you could have been more persuasive. One option now is to distinguish what is useful on a practical level from your emotions and irrational fears. 
LIBRA, Libra: A little-known characteristic of your sign is its connection with generals and military men. This is of interest now because over the next two weeks you still have the opportunity to fight and win an important battle. But you need allies who will stick by you, no matter what. Editorial | It may be diplomatically imprudent to alienate a friendly neighbour with CAA premise — persecution within 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: Almost everything, from the initial planning stage until the final act, seems to be taking place with a degree of secrecy. If other people are unaware of what is going on you must take it upon yourself to protect their interests. They would expect no less! 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Make partnership the key to your success over the next two weeks. You must take on board a few simple home truths particularly that, if you collaborate, you may seriously enhance your prospects. Also, if you still have a long-held but undeveloped creative talent, now is the time to let rip. Read | How Indian bowlers yorked their way to series win against Australia 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn:In no circumstances must you be pressurised into abandoning your personal career or worldly ambitions, no matter if partners do try a little emotional blackmail. The people who try to pressurise you might have little idea of your actual needs, so you may have to sit down and tell them once again! AQUARIUS Aquarius: Believe it or not this is now the astrologically ideal moment for a journey into the unknown! This may not fit in with other pressures, but perhaps you can make a start on future plans. Actually, it's a day which could bring new responsibilities and professional opportunities. 
TAURUS, Taurus: Lunar alignments are setting you up for an emotional moment. The only potential flash point occurs when a partner makes an unreasonable demand but, if you start the day with dignity and care - and continue in the same vein - then you should go on to enjoy all that life has to offer. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Keep yourself to yourself if that is what you wish, no matter what demands other people may place on your time and energy. You may use the day constructively to restore your vital emotional reserves, and to catch up with all those overdue chores. CANCER Cancer: It is easy to forecast continuing domestic upheaval for Cancers, but impossible to state exactly what stage you have reached: some of you are still formulating your plans while others are on the final stretch. Don't let other people put too much pressure on you. READ | No politics, PM told J&amp;K-bound Ministers 
LEO, Leo: The only daily variation in your solar chart this week is provided by the Moon, which means that life should be relatively trouble-free. Today's one blot on the horizon is the vague, but easily avoidable, possibility of irritations at work. Keep your cool! 
VIRGO, Virgo: If today brings any change in your mood from last week, it's likely to be a feeling that life is a great adventure waiting to be explored. Try to carry this optimistic revelation into even the most trivial affairs, because you never know exactly when - or how - you'll discover the answers to your current questions. 
LIBRA, Libra; You are still likely to be much busier than most of your partners and associates, but you should be thankful that your unique qualities are in demand, rather than resentful at the thought that you are doing more than your fair share. After all, it's good to be wanted! READ | IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli give India a 7-wicket win in decider 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: The major theme of the week may be money and how to maximise your resources. One emerging possibility is that you will be offered a very discreet chance to form a profitable new partnership. You may be a little over-emotional today, but you'll be in a strong position. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: It should please you no end to know that your social life is set to flourish, even though there may be one or two complications. Today, though, you must pay sufficient attention to your routine chores and commitments prior to accepting any new invitations. READ | President Kovind will present the Ramnath Goenka Awards for Excellence in Journalism today 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: The Moon, that regulator of your daily emotions, occupies a friendly position, setting you up to take charge of your personal affairs. This is a day to shape your future rather than look for definite forecasts. It's also a useful moment to follow up a hunch. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Something that takes place today may stiffen your resolve to make improvements in your domestic relationships. It is important, though, that you look to the future rather than dwelling on the past, even if certain people keep harking back to the way things used to be. READ | Express exclusive: Custody death of a 20-year-old is part of cloud over Davinder Singh 
TAURUS, Taurus: If you're contemplating any domestic expenditure or, better still, a property transaction, the indications could not be more perfect later in the week. And that goes whether you're buying, selling or renting. But rather than choosing just one option you may be able to have your cake - and eat it! Read | Why Pakistani Hindus living in Jodhpur camps believe Citizenship Act is their passport to future 
GEMINI, Gemini: The Sun's relationship with Mercury, your ruling planet, crystallises all that is best about a positive time in your life. One word of warning, though - your judgment will be just a little too personal. At work, you must take detailed notice of what colleagues are doing, not what they are saying. CANCER Cancer: The Moon passes through a series of friendly regions of your chart, which is all very well for your peace of mind, but on Saturday and Sunday, when life becomes more dreamy and imaginative, you can expect to strike it rich romantically. By then, your stars will be increasingly nostalgic and sentimental. Tavleen Singh writes | Why offend Mr Bezos? 
LEO, Leo: By all the ancient and traditional rules of astrology, Leo is now basking under unprecedented beneficial planetary alignments, but only if you let partners have their say and their fair share. The only question is, are you big enough to rise to the challenge? Get spending plans sorted out before fate lends a hand. 
VIRGO, Virgo: You may put all vague fears, suspicions and inadequacies to one side and avoid people who are gossiping, plotting and conspiring. Honesty is the only policy. If education is important, it now looks as if you, or a very close relative, are past the worst. Pay more attention to younger relations. Their spontaneity could inspire you.

LIBRA, Libra: It's difficult to know where your priorities lie - a familiar dilemma, perhaps. This time you have two considerations - self-interest on the one hand and ethics on the other. Find a middle way. Money matters will come under some strain towards the end of the week, so keep an eye on all developments. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: You are normally much too self-effacing, perhaps because you lack confidence or imagine that other people will laugh at you. My advice at the moment is to be unashamedly egotistical, and to look after number one - within reason! I'm not saying that you should be selfish, but you need to do what's right. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: You tend to idealise anything which is unattainable. Romantic Sagittarians are likely to fall in love with a distant image, or to be susceptible to fleeting glances. Let your dreams take over. Around midweek you may receive a windfall -although just how much is another question! It may be that the benefits are purely emotional. 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: At the very least, you may expect a minor bonus. At best, you can hope to scoop the top prizes. If you don't experience at least some financial luck this week you've done something radically wrong. You can look forward to interesting and heartening family news around the beginning of the week. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Romantic and emotional opportunities are but the tip of an iceberg of personal growth and happiness which is promising to overwhelm you. Please, for your own sake, surrender to your passions, because if you don't you won't understand them. And, having understood them, you'll work out how you can fix it in the future. 
TAURUS, Taurus: The planets are once again provoking your often neglected, adventurous instincts. It's time to travel, taking in places which are odd, unusual and different. If you can't get away now, make plans for later in the year. Even your romantic feelings could be stirred by people from far away. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Your current planetary alignments are undoubtedly extremely powerful, but are also very confused. You may have no option but to lie low and postpone certain ambitions, no matter how impatient you may feel. Continue to focus on financial discussions, though. CANCER Cancer: The planets are starting to crystallise all that is best and most hopeful in your life, setting you up for years to come. Much depends on your ability to handle close partnerships, and to create a sort of extended feel-good factor. But sometimes, though, you can want too much - much more than is really on offer.

LEO, Leo: Aside from reminding you of the need to give the first priority to dealing with practical chores, I would remind you of the virtues of charitable behaviour, if only out of self-interest. In some strange way you will gain from putting others first for a change. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Social, political and community involvements should take a leap into the unknown. You will be glad of all your group involvements even if the consequences last week were not exactly what you intended. At least now you can make up for an old muddle. 
LIBRA, Libra: The dual prospect is held out of fabulous professional success combined with dramatic moves at home. Take your chances and go for family and domestic changes if that is what concerns you most. All Libran artists, athletes and lovers take strength from today's lunar patterns. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan writes: Protests against the new citizenship law are constitutional, they seek to protect its basic structure 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It's time to be high-minded and high-principled, though not pompous or self-righteous. If you've a list of practical tasks, give a priority to anything with legal or overseas consequences. Long-distance travel and trips could well bring more than you bargained for. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Have you ever had the feeling that family members are ganging up on you? Well, they probably are. I wouldn't worry, though, because you're much too big a person to be put off by such silly games. Relax and have a laugh, even if the monetary scene is a little complex. Read | ‘Qawwali nahi chalegi': Kathak dancer says performance stopped 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: This is no time to behave like a conventional, conservative Capricorn. Why not open yourself up to new experiences and appreciate all that other people have to offer? You can accept all unusual invitations - and don't be embarrassed by generosity. AQUARIUS Aquarius: The weekend's special planetary alignment enhances all that is most noble in the Aquarian character - your selfless idealism and devotion to others. The only drawback is that you may become much too tied up in your own deep imaginary hopes and fears. 
TAURUS, Taurus: The Moon is offering the best genuinely friendly celestial alignment you've had all week. The most general advice I can offer is to try to look beyond the material pressures of the last week and plan for a brilliant and brighter life. And look to the future with faith. 
GEMINI, Gemini: Venus is protecting your social life and relationships with colleagues, meaning that you may now be ready to take a few risks. Your approach must be subtle but firm. There is nothing to be gained from storming in with all guns blazing, unduly alarming people who are in a nervous mood. CANCER Cancer: Personal freedom is the key, although you will have to judge whether you can afford to abandon certain onerous but necessary responsibilities. Perhaps you should keep fundamental personal commitments in place for now, at least until you're sure that there is space for change. Read | Children being radicalised in J&amp;K, isolate them gradually, says CDS Rawat 
LEO, Leo: As emotional turbulence dies down, you will begin to see that life must be tackled on a purely practical basis, doing what needs to be done in an unfussy and unpretentious manner. No frills are needed, so don't get seduced into unnecessary sidelines. 
VIRGO, Virgo: Domestic affairs occupy your time, and family members will demand your attention. Actually, although a great many important developments seem to be in the offing, if you concentrate on personal affairs you should avoid emotional tangles. READ | After one month of CAA protest, key question for both BJP, Opp: Will protests percolate below the top soil? 
LIBRA, Libra: You're being encouraged to try out new solutions to old problems. From a close look at your current stars, I'd say that you need to focus on the untried and original, rather than on outmoded ways of doing things. Get on and give up all those bad habits that you know have been holding you back. 
SCORPIO, Scorpio: It's been a bit of a serious week so far, what with turbulent planetary influences causing certain plans to be postponed or changed. However, now that the Moon is moving into lighter regions of the zodiac you can let up the pressure. You can even allow partners to look after the practical details. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sagittarius: Celestially speaking, the Moon is under control. In your private affairs this means that what you say goes, at least as far as home affairs are concerned. Set a generous example and hold out the promise of emotional rewards if you want other people to follow your lead. In Photos | Jeff Bezos attends star-studded Amazon Prime Video event 
CAPRICORN, Capricorn: Make every effort possible to get in touch with old friends over the next few days. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the emotional support that such contacts can bring, and will soon be very much happier. You will, however, not always feel in control of your own affairs. AQUARIUS Aquarius: Your stars are fortunate, but wasteful. Although a number of areas of your solar chart are showing difficulties, others are considerably easier. The part of your chart symbolising your work, for example, is indicating great promise if you only give up a few stale habits. 
TAURUS, Don't beat about the bush or stifle your feelings. Enough has been said and done over the past four or five days to give you all the ammunition you need to turn the tables on a rival. In general, you're in a strong personal position, mainly because you'll be taking sensible safeguards. 
GEMINI, Workmates may be in an obstructive mood, yet now that you've come this far, I think that the prospects for financial advances are excellent. It may, though, be necessary to give before you are entitled to receive, and you may have to ask for a favour before you grant one. Chhattisgarh's Congress govt challenges NIA Act, a UPA-era law Cancer You're busy enough, but an additional factor to consider this week, on top of those we have already mentioned, is the important role to be played by friends and associates. The one question to be answered is why certain people are so reluctant to be pinned down. 
LEO, Relief comes later on in the form of heightened support from people who will encourage you to see the best and look on the bright side. Relationships with children and younger relatives will improve, and partners will like you all the more if you sit down and listen to them, whether you're interested or not. Open to probe Davinder Singh's role in 2001 Parliament attack case: J&amp;K DGP 
VIRGO, Your mood will change before long. In some respects it may be a case of out of the frying pan into the fire, yet, if you value the stimulation offered by a fresh challenge, you could have a thoroughly worthwhile time. If you opt for a quiet life you may miss out on a major opportunity. 
LIBRA, To continue with our occasional financial theme, there is no reason why you cannot deal with problems by throwing money at them. In other words, why not spend your way to happiness? A shopping binge is just what you need. It's all down to Venus, by the way, a helpful planet if ever there was one. 
SCORPIO, In spite of appearances to the contrary, you do have a fair degree of influence at home. It may be time to inject a dose of humour into the proceedings. In times to come, you will look back and laugh at current fiascos without feeling the need to blame yourself or others. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you are to maximise your financial advantage, all that is needed is a careful hand. You should begin to think about breaking a tie or association which has failed to bear fruit. But you need to set yourself free without stirring up a can of worms, if you know what I mean. 
CAPRICORN, It seems to you that people you were relying on have not done their best. Someone may have stepped out of line, perhaps with no justification whatsoever. Your task is to respond to all transgressions in the most appropriate manner, which may be to be generous, open and ready to forgive. Horoscope 2020: Here is what's in store for you AQUARIUS One point in your favour is your skill at putting over your point of view or telling a tall story. It seems to me that other people should be turning to you for your diplomatic gifts if they know what's good for them. You could probably earn a mint as a sales-person. 
TAURUS, Today's powerful Moon piles on the pressure and that's a good thing. Everything depends on your sense of timing and it's vital that you instinctively know when to stand firm and when to compromise. Only you can take these decisions, so there is no reason to sit around while other people make up their minds. READ | Cases start falling in Muzaffarnagar: 19 of 107 freed after police say no evidence 
GEMINI, Your resilience may be eroded, if only because you could do with a rest. Yet, there is much that you can do to help yourself, like standing aside from battles you can't win. After all, there's no reason why you should waste your energy on people who don't deserve it. Cancer The Moon blazes brilliantly in parts of your chart best known for their influence over cultural, creative and artistic proclivities. Perhaps it's time for a spot of self-improvement. It's certainly the moment for a few dramatic gestures: you still have the capacity to issue some big surprises. 
LEO, You'll put the maximum effort into domestic and family relationships, perhaps because your instincts tell you that partners need to be placated. Many of you will be reviving plans for a move of home, or at least for substantial reforms, but others must be fully consulted. 
VIRGO, Your words of wisdom will be highly valued, for once. You could try to bring your clear approach to all tangled emotional problems, both helping yourself and assisting others in their efforts to free themselves from excessively successively complicated situations. READ | JNU violence: Police name masked woman in video, ABVP admits she is their member 
LIBRA, Rather than concentrating exclusively on the details of your savings and bank balance, get to grips with the deeper issues. For example, what is it exactly that you need to make you feel materially secure? A profound question, I know, but no less necessary for all that. 
SCORPIO, A spectacular relationship between Neptune and the Moon could soon set the cat among the pigeons. Welcome changes are in line for some of you, but many will experience no more than maddening obstruction from partners. In the meantime, stay out of trouble. 
SAGITTARIUS, Don't let all that current tension get to you physically. Why not spare a little thought for your body and see to it that your diet and exercise are exactly what is needed? If there's room for improvement, make the necessary moves without undue delay. READ | Muslim population up as they got special rights: Yogi Adityanath 
CAPRICORN, I don't think there's any use in going it alone. Indeed, so powerful are the social trends in your solar chart that you may do best to abandon some of your own plans and fall in with others' arrangements. You may fear rejection, but there will always be room for you. AQUARIUS A series of spectacular aspects is soon due to raise questions about your private life. In particular, it seems that either you have been reluctant to commit yourself, or that you have done so on the basis of false information. All will become clear before long. 
TAURUS, If you're thinking of going behind someone's back, or arranging secret meetings, be very careful and be sure to take a high moral stand. The point is that with the world in its present unpredictable phase you need to work out what's best for you. Only take a risk if you're prepared for the consequences. 
GEMINI, Much that is hidden is about to be revealed. My word of caution to you for the week is not to get involved in murky matters such as rumours, conspiracies, plots and counter-plots. This sort of activity is the only thing which could mar your reputation. So, always do your best. Read | Nadella on CAA: 'Sad, would love to see a Bangla immigrant head Infosys' Cancer You may live for your passion. By this I mean that you must let nothing stand in the way of achieving your dearest wish. For the next twelve weeks, nobody must be allowed to restrict your freedom or deny you the many opportunities you so richly deserve. 
LEO, The combination of lunar emotion with Leonine intensity is sure to prove a very potent one over the next few days. Professional Leos may discover that certain essential considerations may have been overlooked. Those of you with family business to conduct should take a common-sense approach. 
VIRGO, If you're travelling this week, or making travel plans, then please leave nothing to chance. Fate has a way of springing surprises on the unwary, which means that you must be prepared for any eventuality — even when what you discover is to your advantage. Editorial | Australia's bush fires have left Koalas with a tough struggle for survival 
LIBRA, For the next three days you will be moving into the depths of a financial whirlwind. Some of you will experience nothing but minor irritations, but those planning major deals should seek expert advice. In matters of the heart, it's family feelings which take first place. 
SCORPIO, The Moon creeps into an influential region of your chart, adding to your already considerable Scorpionic emotional power and determination. When your position is so powerful, care and subtlety are essential, as is a willingness to handle all the financial details. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon aligns with the area of your chart that powerfully aspects your deepest desires. You may therefore be susceptible to strange, surreal dreams. We astrologers believe that all dreams reveal a personal message, so take note. There could even be some financial gain. Read | Interrogation on: DySP Davinder Singh sheltered militants at J&amp;K home, say cops 
CAPRICORN, The Sun and Moon are pulling you in different directions. I doubt if your life will be rendered any less complex by these massive celestial movements, but at least others will soon be smiling on your efforts. A younger relation could be in need of your very best emotional support. AQUARIUS It's quite natural that your costs should be rising. This is all due to macho Mars' impact on your social aspirations and long-term hopes and wishes. Yet, if you have a choice, you should splash out on ideas, activities and objects which will make your life more colourful. 
TAURUS, The truth will come out, eventually. Stormy celestial relationships follow one another with great frequency. This is hardly a relaxing prospect and most Taureans will be caught up in one stressful situation or another this week. The trick is to come out smiling. 
GEMINI, Your wit and intelligence will be in much demand this week. You'll be called upon to be the arbiter in all sorts of disagreements, some of them important, others utterly pointless and insignificant. What seems like a waste of time now may turn out to have its uses a little way down the line. Cancer Not for about four months have the stars achieved such a welcoming formation, encouraging partners to offer you full support. Although you are due to take another stunning leap forward over the coming two months, what happens may relate back to the events of long ago. READ | Horoscope 2020: Here is what's in store for you 
LEO, It's a busy moment, but an imaginative one. You will soon be forced to take some fundamental measures affecting the very foundations of your life. Yet, while there will be a sense of urgency it is unlikely that arrangements made now will prove hard and fast. 
VIRGO, In spite of your need for certainty, it is very difficult to make firm predictions this week other than to say that any disruption that does take place must be seen as part of a larger and definitely positive pattern. Communication breakdowns are possibly the major hazard. 
LIBRA, An unusual number of planetary influences are jockeying for attention. Expect a busy week. In fact, I think you should actively take on more than you can handle in the knowledge that even unlikely new commitments will become central to your affairs in the near future. READ | From cars to watches, protests hit India Inc: ‘Decline in customers visiting showrooms' 
SCORPIO, Try to see the whole of the coming week in the round, reaching a peak around Wednesday or Thursday — or Friday. You should plan all your personal affairs with care and don't be alarmed if other people try to pull out of joint arrangements; it could be for the best. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's uncertain whether the main pressures on you this week will be completely illusory or, on the other hand, will be all too real. Therefore, you should take nothing for granted, but neither should you get too wound up over worries which may vanish when fresh light is shed on them. READ | Explained: How warm was 2019, and why? 
CAPRICORN, Once again, your stars are moving towards a major alignment that is going to shake up the entire world. You may see the exciting events in your own life over the next few months as part of a marvellous larger pattern, leading you to much greater personal satisfaction. AQUARIUS Major moves are afoot at home this week. I suspect that your priorities may be challenged, either by other people or by your own tendency to over-commit yourself. Aquarians in the caring professions will do best at work, and if you put other people first then you will also gain. READ | Parliament attack, Afzal Guru shadow back to haunt J&amp;K Police officer 
TAURUS, Be prepared for happy family events and successful domestic ventures. Don't expect announcements just yet. Monetary matters will become increasingly important as the week progresses, especially where joint arrangements are concerned. 
GEMINI, Unless you get your message across and persuade others that you are right, you may have to wait a while for your chance to return. Enhanced financial prospects offer some compensation. Romantic developments focus around mid-week, and there is every chance of a very important meeting. Cancer Mercury, planet of thought and communication is steaming through a curious and colourful region of your chart. The result within, say, about two weeks, should be a radical shift of the odds in your favour. Home life will become increasingly tense, but the results could be exactly as desired. 
LEO, Fresh choices are coming your way, but why not begin where you left off at the end of last week, with your stars in a position so perfect as to be almost unbelievable? If you play your cards right, then you'll be set up for life! If you want to cheer yourself up, a little shopping and a few treats should lift your morale. 
VIRGO, Think long and deep about what is the best thing to do. You want to help others without being exploited and fulfil your own dreams without being overwhelmed by illusions and fantasies. Keep your feet on the ground at the beginning of the week, and take decisions based on the real facts rather than in what you imagine. 
LIBRA, You may well still be able to benefit from travel, as adventurous, social stars are at their strongest. Contact with foreign countries and distant parts could significantly broaden your horizons, especially if you're searching out new emotional links or considering family changes. 
SCORPIO, Don't forget the importance of maintaining a grip on family chores and domestic responsibilities, but without squashing people you live with. Over the rest of the year try to lay down deep foundations. Romantic considerations should be on the back burner. 
SAGITTARIUS, Yet again your planetary formations are perfect. All we can say is that if you don't manage to make the most of your life and talents, the truth is that the fault lies with you, not with your stars. Family affairs have been complicated, but there should now be a light at the end of the tunnel. 
CAPRICORN, Now that Venus is beginning to behave itself once again, the balance of power in one particular partnership will shift very subtly. You'll be extremely wise indeed to listen to good advice because, if you don't, you will sink into complacency while others make the running. AQUARIUS Unattached Aquarians will be feeling the pull of permanent relationships — what an ideal time to get hitched. All partnerships, whether personal or professional, are ripe for resuscitation. At work, do make an extra effort to keep an employer sweet at the end of the week. 
TAURUS, Taureans who are travelling can afford to thank their foresight, mainly because the best possibilities seem to lie far from home. All intimate and romantic plans will be subject to sudden change, unless each and every detail has been worked out. 
GEMINI, Once again it's your financial situation which is at issue. Given that major questions have been answered, today is the ideal moment for an outrageous shopping spree. There's nothing to do but spend, spend, spend. Hopefully you've got sufficient credit. Cancer The current strident planetary positions will have a considerable impact on your personal affairs over the months to come. You are about to be thrust into the limelight, mainly because other people will be appealing for your help. Go ahead and do what you know to be right.

LEO, There's a cosmic drama taking place involving a whole set of planets, one which reflects an inner dilemma in your own existence. Beneath all the flotsam and jetsam of daily life lies a whole level of hope, certainty and determination to succeed in a major ambition. 
VIRGO, Financial costs are a minor consideration. Much more important is your social life, including relations with lovers, children and completely new friends. Not everyone has been kind to you, but perhaps they were under pressures of their own. Take your pleasures gladly and try something new. 
LIBRA, You have learned to turn the spotlight on to areas of your life which have been ignored for far too long. The best way to achieve the contentment you deserve is to diversify your activities and broaden your interests. You have assets and talents which other people could benefit from as well.

SCORPIO, You have various methods by which you can achieve your personal goals. You are still using finances as a lever, both to push yourself forward and to assist others. Today, though, generous gestures may conflict with the basic feeling that your interests must come first. 
SAGITTARIUS, You need to take a little time to protect yourself and ensure that others are in no position to undermine your self-confidence. If they should try, see that they don't succeed. Aside from such questions, your social stars are certainly promising. 
CAPRICORN, I'd like to say that all the uncertainty and confusion of the past is at an end, but I can't - not just yet. However, if only you could alter your attitudes you would see just how well off you really are. It's quite possible that change is for the good, and that a small loss now paves the way for a big gain later on. READ | Ex-CEA Arvind Subrananian writes: To subject youth to violence only adds to their sense of hopelessness about the future AQUARIUS The Moon is in a friendly sector of your chart, indicating that yours is one of that group of signs sharing welcome emotional influences. Yet you may have to take second place just for a while, as partners hog the limelight. Why not make the most of it and put your feet up? 
TAURUS, You can forget the details which normally occupy your Taurean consciousness. It's issues of principle which demand your attention today, and you should make every effort to focus on the larger picture. In particular, you need to establish who is responsible for a recent mess. 
GEMINI, Your social life should already have taken a welcome turn, with a better than average chance of happy invitations and long sought-after contacts finally coming your way. You should appreciate all good fortune, otherwise an opportunity may be snatched from you again. CANCER You must now make a positive choice. I am afraid there is little time left and if you fail to act decisively you may miss your chance for at least another six months, by which time your position will have changed — and you might find yourself back at square one. Horoscope 2020: Here is what's in store for you 
LEO, There's been a lot of tension around lately, and some harsh words. Relationships at work may not be as easy as you would like, but they never are when you are forced to change, even when that change is for the better. A good rest is the best way to ward off nervous exhaustion. 
VIRGO, You're not quite sure what to do next, but the first step in the right direction is probably to level with loved ones. You can afford to feel more than confident that they will have to accept whatever you decide. After all, you are boss. At least, you will be if you stay cool.

LIBRA, The last few days may have brought strange feelings and new desires, but the coming ones are crucial as far as short-term romantic, social and work plans are involved. Don't allow yourself to be pressurised or forced into making arrangements against your will. 
SCORPIO, The Moon moves into a region of your horoscope which, while not entirely sympathetic, nevertheless reinforces important and special Scorpionic traits. You can move forward with hope, especially as you seem to take in your stride the sort of upsets which throw other people off balance. 
SAGITTARIUS, You might well have had enough of certain people, and perhaps you'd like to spend some time by yourself. Yet, a potentially sociable period begins today and many of you may consider taking the day off. At the very least, you should put mindless details to one side and take steps to vary your activities.

CAPRICORN, It's one thing to juggle all your different responsibilities, but another to keep every ball in the air at the same time. Please be realistic — and don't take on more than you can possibly handle. If you do make commitments, you don't intend to fulfil, then you may be unpleasantly surprised when other people hold you to your word. AQUARIUS Venus is now sufficiently far into a sympathetic region of your chart for us to make certain statements about your leisure activities. In particular, the emphasis is shifting towards self-indulgence, so why don't you pamper yourself — just for a change? READ | Darbar review: An out-and-out Rajinikanth movie 
TAURUS, Today's planetary picture adds to the general feeling that even though there may be little change in your long-term prospects, the day-to-day situation is moving rapidly. You must be prepared to adapt to altering circumstances, or risk being left behind. 
GEMINI, Psychologically, the biggest issue you face is how much you value yourself. Geminians often suffer from a poor self-image, the result of taking criticism far too personally. A thicker skin would come in handy. And don't let other people get on your nerves. Cancer The Sun is shedding new light on areas of your life that have remained hidden for some time. Some of what you discover will be welcome but the rest may force a radical re-think. In love, old relationships are favoured, and deep passions could surface at any moment. 
LEO, Venus aligns with Jupiter in a pattern which allows you to put aside certain cares and woes and enjoy yourself for a change. Meanwhile, other planets stir up long-buried feelings. In spite of the prevailing uncertainty you must make time for a little innocent pleasure. 
VIRGO, Being a Virgo you will no doubt do your utmost to get the better of other people, especially family members, and neutralise those who have been giving you the run-around at home. However, here's a tip — be very careful if you're giving someone a ticking-off, because they might over-react. 
LIBRA, Although you might prefer to do things in a completely open or direct manner, as is your Libran inclination, you will get what you really want through discreet meetings and indirect approaches. One step forward, three steps sideways, should do the business. 
SCORPIO, You should neither shirk your responsibilities nor avoid certain personal confrontations, but you must reject those burdens which are frankly out of step with your current needs, wants and desires. You should also be very restrained when subjected to provocation or pressure. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is still very much a question of juggling your personal commitments. You've been through a great deal in the past, but now you must realise that other people are basically well-disposed. Even if someone does criticise you, it may not be you who they're really angry with. 
CAPRICORN, You cannot leave personal matters unresolved. The moment you relax, other people are likely to take the reins and events will slip out of your control. Travel stars are under helpful lunar alignments, so you might decide to take a look around — and see what's over the next hill. AQUARIUS This is a complicated moment, mainly because people aren't really saying what they mean. I'd advise you to take a responsible attitude. Paradoxically, this may be the only way to ensure that the required change in your responsibilities, perhaps against someone else's wishes, is successful. 
TAURUS, One particular tie or association should now have reached a turning-point. Even if the consequence was a complete break, you can be assured that in the long run all was for the very best. Even an old rejection, or failure, may turn out to have saved you for something better. 
GEMINI, As from today, financial planning is due to achieve a much greater priority in your daily affairs. You'll be signing papers, making deals, negotiating contracts and summoning family conferences. But, however practical the steps you're taking, your emotional commitment will be beyond question. Cancer You can be the most tolerant of people — nobody would deny that. But you're not one to suffer fools or put up with incompetence, especially not at work. However, it may be your own overweening ambition or impatience which causes minor problems today. Humility pays. Horoscope 2020: Here is what's in store for you 
LEO, You are moving into a secretive phase which could last for another two weeks. You may be wise to keep certain information to yourself, regarding other people being unfit to know what you have in mind. You have to steer clear of those who jump to conclusions — the wrong conclusions. 
VIRGO, The Moon adjusts its position in the early hours, raising the energy level just slightly. Only night-owls, shift-workers and early-risers will notice the change of mood that takes place then, but all of you will be happier by midday. Or, at least, you'll know that a difficulty can be satisfactorily dealt with. 
LIBRA, There is certainly no reason for you to feel inadequate or guilty. The trouble is that the Moon tends to evoke in you some mysterious feeling that you have done something you shouldn't have, even when you haven't. Perhaps you've just got a guilty conscience. READ | Follow live updates on the Bharat Bandh today  
SCORPIO, It's a time for discussions, meetings and negotiations, mainly because you have to try and balance the prevailing emotional atmosphere. In view of current uncertainties, one thing we can be definite about is that decisions reached now will be overturned within no more than a few days. 
SAGITTARIUS, It certainly is difficult to keep the simplest of things in perspective. The danger at the present time is that you're likely to blow relatively trivial molehills up into rather troublesome mountains. Don't exaggerate your weaknesses or over-estimate your strengths. 
CAPRICORN, Partners and rivals shouldn't be too complacent. You have one or two tricks up your sleeve and it will be a foolish person who attempts to pull the wool over your eyes. You can save your trump cards until the weekend — and, even then, you should probably keep something in reserve. READ | JNU violence: Deepika Padukone stands in — and up AQUARIUS You're never quite sure what is going to happen next. It may be that what is being discussed or arranged will lead to welcome developments at work or in more personal areas, but your needs are so utterly individual, unique even, that they are impossible to satisfy. 
TAURUS, At the exact moment that Venus, your planetary ruler, adjusts its position, it enjoys a powerful relationship with Neptune, the most romantic of all the planets: in short it's time for emotional enlightenment. The scales will soon fall from your eyes as you see an old friend in a new light. 
GEMINI, If there's one thing that's certain in the astrological universe, it's that nothing is certain. The ebb and flow in the tide of your emotional fortunes is a marvellous thing to behold. Your feelings are due to emerge into the full glare of public scrutiny, so, at all costs, be prepared. Horoscope 2020: Here is what's in store for you CANCER Life can be pricey, perhaps too expensive. Lunar alignments are still urging you to spend. I'm not talking about outrageous shopping sprees, just those necessary purchases which you have put off for far too long. By the way, your professional stars are extraordinary. 
LEO, For a second day running the Moon is in a potentially volatile position. I suspect that you may be recovering from a recent embarrassment, but there is little to worry you, and others will be ready to forgive and forget. All you have to do is avoid repeating a past mistake. READ | Unmasked on WhatsApp: JNU chief proctor to eight ABVP office-bearers 
VIRGO, Your actions can be interpreted in a number of different ways. Whether you are genuinely selfless or, in fact, quite selfish is a moot point on which many people disagree. Whatever the answer, you will have to put your interests in second place for another twenty-four hours. 
LIBRA, The future is bright, but your judgment must be impeccable. Everything that happens now will strengthen your bargaining power, but only if you have the resolve to carry on and the commonsense to avoid the greater excesses encouraged by irresponsible people. READ | PB Mehta writes: JNU violence reflects an apocalyptic politics driven by a constant need to find new enemies 
SCORPIO, The time has come to change direction and prove just how independent, forceful and original you can be. Uranus insists that the decisions you take reflect your needs and yours alone. Meanwhile, nebulous Neptune creates a sense that anything is possible. 
SAGITTARIUS, The planets are always on the move, and during the weeks and months ahead you must remain aware that your financial situation will be swinging wildly between one extreme and another. Keep a steady eye on the situation, for as soon as your concentration wavers you'll make a major mistake. 
CAPRICORN, At a time such as this, the mood could move to either end of the spectrum. You see, goodwill, generosity and hospitality may all too easily tip into excessive greed, selfishness and resentment. And, if that happens, then you'll expose yourself to massive criticism. READ | Recourse to violence frightening, says Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee on JNU AQUARIUS The only way to deal with an extremely awkward and potentially upsetting situation is to keep your own counsel and avoid intervening in anyone else's affairs. You just cannot gauge the consequences of your actions, so that's all the more reason for caution. 
TAURUS, There's a fairly pronounced change in planetary energies this week, moving from pure excitement and drama to a situation that combines the need for adventure with sobriety and caution: a tall order! Your natural caution will come in extremely handy. 
GEMINI, There's little change in the long-term cycle for the bulk of Geminians this week. However, the rapid movements of Venus and Mercury point to a series of intriguing fluctuations in your personal relationships. Meanwhile, Mars indicates rising tension, so keep the lid on wilder feelings. Horoscope Today, January 6, 2020: Read in Hindi CANCER It may be another twelve months before your seeds which are sown now come to fruition. However, you should soon begin to see very beneficial results. You can look forward to the future with hope, but in the meantime, you'd better pay close attention to the details.

LEO, The Moon arrives in a powerful region of your chart, bringing a remarkable degree of emotional strength. Play your cards right now and you will emerge as the dominant force at home and the victor in a family struggle. Friends may be falling out - and you'll soon be called in to play the peacemaker. 
VIRGO, Your better Virgoan qualities are all set to flourish. You have little choice but to adhere to the self-sacrificing tendencies that you would rather forget. But that doesn't mean that you should let people walk all over you. Far from it. By doing the right thing you will attract loyalty and respect.

LIBRA, Challenging planetary aspects may set you on edge, but shouldn't disturb your genuine peace of mind. Perhaps you will find welcome stimulation intense situations. A little extra stress might be all it takes to push into finally achieving a cherished goal. 
SCORPIO, Certain partners have been very loyal indeed and have gone out of their way to put up with your needs and desires. However, you might be wise to backtrack and make an attempt to be more amenable. If you have made a mistake at home, now's your chance to make amends. 
SAGITTARIUS, You haven't always had a fair deal, but that should soon change. The stirring impact of Mars, planet of energy, on intense Pluto, is arousing your righteous anger. You will fight for your rights, even if you're wrong! Make sure you don't pick on an inappropriate target, though! READ | Nobel couple Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee at Express Adda today 
CAPRICORN, Venus' most powerful relationship today bodes well for love, but you do have to find the right words to say what you want. The impact on your life may, therefore, be indirect, but no less impressive, explosive even, for all that. Look to close friends for support. AQUARIUS A perfect planetary period for family gatherings and home entertaining is now beginning. Hopefully, you will make the most of wonderful opportunities and now have your memories to look back on. But it may not be possible to keep impatient partners waiting forever.

TAURUS, The Year Ahead It's time to get your act together. If all goes according to plan, you'll be making your ideas concrete, bringing them to fruition in a way that you've been struggling to do for so long. The early part of the year brings the distinct possibility of new activities in which you will blossom forth and show your talents to their fullest. It's a time of harmony and balance as well as hard work. Later in the year certain people may be doing things which you disapprove of on moral grounds, so be careful if you don't want to get involved in arguments over matters of principle. Enjoy yourself! LOVE AND ROMANCE As January opens, you find yourself entering a period of transition. A dilemma may arise in your social life, and you will have to go to great lengths to ensure that partners are content with your activities. Romantic concerns may well be taking precedence over work in the first part of the year, for the simple reason that professional matters may be so complicated that you do not know which way to turn — and it's easy to enjoy a spot of romantic escapism. However, there's also inspiration in the air, so don't be tempted to sit around waiting for people to come your way, take the initiative. WORK AND MONEY February is an important business month, during which you may experience a complete reversal in your fortunes, hopefully for the better. Look out for disagreements in March and confusion in April. July could also be an excellent month moneywise, and it looks as if you'll be making extravagant financial agreements. Perhaps you'll be asking for more money at work, or inviting friends to join you in a deal. You'll certainly be making plans for the future. October means a compromise at work, because if you wait for someone to back down you could be waiting for a long time. Tip for the year Don't believe promises of instant riches.

GEMINI, The year ahead There are many welcome changes in store for you this year which will require an adjustment in your attitude and, on a number of occasions, you'll be both re — evaluating your progress and changing course. So that's exciting news. In fact, your morale cannot help but be high as you begin the year. Questions such as how far you should get involved with a new friend and what improvements need to be made in an existing relationship will be uppermost. August and September may be intense months so count your blessings. Keep your cool, enjoy whatever life throws at you, and make the most of your opportunities. LOVE AND ROMANCE The practical, easy going side of your nature benefits from cosmic conditions as the year begins. Your love of beauty and the good things of life will be combined with creative, artistic power, and you'll have the ability to relax and enjoy sensual pleasures to the full. However, this very ability of yours to amble through life can lead to laziness and mean that you fail to fulfil your full potential over the summer. You tend to assume other people will take charge of your affairs and, as a result, are often not quick enough to follow up romantic opportunities. Expect unusual and exciting encounters after October. WORK AND MONEY Professional prospects are extraordinarily bright early in the year, but all indications suggest that success is dependent on your ability to work out what other people really want — and this means talking to them as well as following their advice. Say the right words at the most appropriate time and in the best place, and this could be a year of acclaim and success. There's an absence of major planetary alignments in the financial sectors of your horoscope until June but, from then until October, anything could happen. Tip for the year Avoid arguments in December. CANCER The year ahead There's so much potential in your life this year — creatively, financially and socially — that you will need to pace yourself if you don't want to wear yourself out. You may even be tempted to break with the past, split up with someone who's important to you, or undertake a complete change of direction. If you fancy a spot of drama then that's all fine, but, if you're keener on an easy life, you should be a bit more mellow and go for gentle transformation. When you do make substantial changes, hang on to the best of the past rather than making a complete break. LOVE AND ROMANCE You will be initiating activities in the field of pleasure and romance early in the year. Somehow the cosmic tone of the times just seems to suit your confident mood. If you meet with the odd rebuff, don't worry. If you don't try, you won't succeed. Put your feet up in July and August. The relaxed summer period is unlikely to extend into September, though. Having by now decided on your course of action, you will be eager to get on with it. You may be signing up for evening activities, embarking on all those self — improving tasks which will lead to new friendships. WORK AND MONEY April and May are adventurous months; of that there is little doubt. Financially you may be tempted to break with your normal caution and take a number of risks. The results of a gamble must always be uncertain, but even if you do not come out on top, there will be important lessons to be learnt. At work, you are interested in exploring new relationships and ways of completing vital tasks. You will not be happy to be stuck in a rut, although you may hold your fire for the time being. Make October your target for securing a more satisfying job, a prominent role. Tip for the year Let other people in on the secret but, perhaps, don't tell them everything. Tavleen Singh writes: A real leader needed 
LEO, The year ahead What a year this is! Above all, you'll be supremely ambitious, eager to climb to the top in all activities and anxious to do the best you can. You may be taken aback both by the interest friends are expressing in your affairs, and by the central position which a partnership has now come to assume in your life. It's almost as if you're not yourself any more. Someone who is very close to you may be agitated by the direction you are taking early in the year, and you should look on this as a welcome expression of concern for your welfare. LOVE AND ROMANCE Shyness is your great hang — up. You probably don't need an astrologer to tell you that, but it may help to know that you can do something about it and overcome your self — consciousness. My advice to you this year is to team up with groups of people who share your interests or who are involved in activities of which you would like to be a part. You will find it very easy to establish a role for yourself and will soon feel the pleasure that comes from experiencing the admiration of your new friends. May brings surprising encounters, June finds your heart fluttering and, by September, you may be very happy indeed with a new friendship. WORK AND MONEY This is an excellent time for work, not necessarily for great advances in your career but in terms of sorting out your responsibilities, acquiring respect and improving your professional relationships. There'll be every chance to take the lead in March and April. When, in July — August, Mars and Venus stir you up, you'll begin a phase when it will be essential for you to spend some time alone, being quiet and peaceful and listening to the inner voice that tells you what you should be doing. You'll be mulling over financial options in September, but by then it will be important to broaden your horizons and — make a profit.

VIRGO, The year ahead You're in for a busy year. It's so easy to lose track of what to do, when to do it — and even why. The stars' top advice is to organise yourself; keep a pen and paper handy at all times, writing down your thoughts whenever you can, before they vanish like illusions in the night. It's likely that you'll be firmly set on a new course with fresh sources of income coming your way after July. You'll be tempted into a speculative enterprise, but take care and always check — and double — check — all those promises of huge profits. Eventually, the long — term pressure on your finances is building up to the point where you will have to take immediate action to assume control. LOVE AND ROMANCE A whole book of predictions would be insufficient to catalogue the complicated events which are liable to dominate in April. It is too difficult to pick out any particular dates. However, August is brilliant for all — round change, September for new friendships, October for lively relationships and November for practical commitments. Venus ends the year, boosting your confidence and upping your powers of attraction. WORK AND MONEY One thing is clear, and it's that you'll benefit from colleagues' initiatives and good fortune. Financial preoccupations will extend into May, although you may not find events are to your liking. Much depends on how you organise your business affairs later in the year. The June Full Moon will cause problems for some, but it continues to provide valuable help, especially if you should be involved in any legal complexities at this time. By September — October, you'll know the pressures for improvement in your professional affairs — and you'll be aiming for the top job. Tip for the year Take care with cash in January. 
LIBRA, The year ahead You're helped by the very unusual fact that your ruling planet, Mercury, spends so long in sympathetic signs. So, the question comes to mind, why don't you take huge steps to fulfil personal ambitions which may have been pushed aside by pressing daily concerns. And don't play your usual game of waiting until someone comes along who is willing to serve up the goods. Remember that you have no excuse for failure. But don't be too hard on yourself. You will reap the rewards for all your efforts after September, so be patient! LOVE AND ROMANCE January brings your most powerful emotional trends, although you may have to watch while other people get steamed up. It may be June before you feel truly engaged in what's going on, and July before you are able to make your intentions plain. November brings your most intense romantic patterns, but rather than focus on short — term distractions, think about the longer term. By December, you'll be reviewing your long — range commitments. WORK AND MONEY May's stars are simultaneously profitable and extravagant, and much more money than usual will be flowing through your fingers. You'll switch into a fresh financial cycle in July when Jupiter alters its position. The Full Moon in July will raise sharp spending choices at home, and you may have to juggle your own desires with family members' demands. The question is: are you going to spend money on instant gains or are you willing to save for the future? At work you'll be putting in a great deal of extra effort and your reward could be increased responsibility and status. Don't expect gratitude from employers though. Tip for the year Keep a watchful eye out for banana skins when Mars meets Jupiter in November. Read | Three years after demonetisation, a 75-yr-old realises her money is worth nothing 
SCORPIO, The year ahead Mercury, will be your ally for much of the year, encouraging you to put yourself forward as the person with the brightest ideas and the smartest answers. Naturally, friends and colleagues will be impressed, and you may be on the receiving end of social favours or professional acclaim. Yet if you are genuinely intuitive you will sense the change of mood that occurs around April or May, when some of your previous promises and claims will return to haunt you! Agreements may come unstuck and partnerships broken but by September you'll be firmly back on track. This is why it is always so important to keep your feet firmly on the ground and avoid the rash commitments that may get you into deep water. Your independence will be reinforced after October, much to your satisfaction. LOVE AND ROMANCE There is nothing you love more than being in love. Your happiest times are therefore when the planets indicate simple straightforward romance. You could come closest to such feelings in June and July when Venus sails through your chart. You will undoubtedly have a sense of dejà vu — that you've been here before. You will be very much concerned with the serious side of relationships, and with working out any problems. You'll be attracted to older or more experienced people, seduced by their air of wisdom and intrigued by the thought that they can teach you valuable lessons. Make the right decisions though, and don't let anyone take you for a ride. WORK AND MONEY There are plenty of hints about money in this year's chart, perhaps because Saturn's patterns remind you that you'll never put your dreams into effect unless you can pay for them. Some prospects opened by your planets are profitable in the extreme, others less so, some may even cause a cut in your income. Many fluctuations in your financial position are to be expected until August, which is precisely why it is time for you to turn your attention to such mundane matters as your daily cash flow. If you refuse to take this simple step, Fate will step in, you'll fail to maximise your advantages and will suffer a loss. Tip for the year Watch your tongue in May — or you'll say something you'll regret. 
SAGITTARIUS, The year ahead This will be a year of serious thoughts and hard work, and you'll be tempted to make drastic changes in your home, relationships and career simultaneously. Pressures for personal transformation and professional success will pile up — but behind the scenes. You may have a foretaste of times to come by the middle of January but, until May, the emphasis is very much on thinking rather than doing. By July you need to bring other people up to date on your latest plans, and you may have the support you're looking for. In November, you may be able to spend your way out of a tight corner and buy happiness. LOVE AND ROMANCE You had the privilege of being born under the sign that is soon to be the centre of astonishing planetary alignments that there's little you can't achieve if you so wish. You're being blessed by Neptune, planet of dreams, illusion, intuition, imagination and mystery and Uranus, symbol of sudden change. Of course, not all of you will be feeling these planets' alignments for the whole of the year, or at the same time, or even in exactly the same way. January and March are months of romantic good fortune. WORK AND MONEY For the first part of the year you'll be looking to work with other people, not happy unless you feel that you're part of a team which is really going somewhere. From July to December, you'll be much happier to keep yourself to yourself, getting on with personal projects and pursuing private ambitions. You'll also be in an idealistic state of mind, keen to do your bit to make the world a better place. You might be happier working for no reward if you think you're doing some good. You need enough to live on. August and September favour money — making. Tip for the year There's a chance of a muddle in mid — summer; keep on top of things. 
CAPRICORN, The year ahead You'll have every reason to sing and dance, what with the undoubtedly pleasurable patterns linked to magnetic Mars and affectionate Venus through the first part of the year, creating romantic and social opportunities as they move. In any case, you're now moving towards a phase of your life which will be much more serious than has often been the case. You may already be receiving indications that personal security is going to be much more important than in the past, and this means money. At the heart of the matter, though, is the extent to which you value yourself and your true gifts and skills. Try to have as much confidence in your talents. LOVE AND ROMANCE Jupiter will be stirring up your feelings in January, February and the beginning of March. This is a prosperous position and one which is indicative of success in education and good fortune through travel, inaugurating a period of romantic change. June's stars are pleasantly sociable, but intense alignments in July and August bring new and favourable encounters. You are moving into a phase when you'll have a much greater than usual need for privacy and seclusion. You will be feeling less sociable and your true friends will understand your need to be alone. True romance will be important to you than to be surrounded by flatterers. WORK AND MONEY Focus on your career until April if you want to get the best long — term benefit out of powerful planetary aspects, including Venus' delicate and prosperous patterns. Make applications, go for interviews, seek promotion, and generally expand your ambitions. In July you'll come close to making your mark on the world and the last thing you want to do is waste any offers that come your way. Big choices will face you on several occasions during September, and all the signs are that you'll cope very well. You could face a minor change of direction, which could see you pursuing your long — term ideals. Tip for the year Take care with cash, in November. AQUARIUS The year ahead The stars are on your side this year, and bring you more blessings than difficulties. You can help your cause by keeping loved ones happy even when they don't share your ideas. Your big month could be May when the planets create exactly the right conditions for you to free yourself from all those situations which have made you feel as if you are losing control of your personal life. You'll stand up to people who have held you back but be fair to those who have given you a helping hand. September raises financial stakes, and you could turn a possible loss into a profit. LOVE AND ROMANCE You are a sensitive soul, but you must remember that other people's feelings also need to be respected. February, marks the best period for romance, and you may receive an intriguing offer when the Moon joins the picture. June and July could bring emotional expenses — in other words if you want to persuade a particular person that you're right for them, you may have to shell out, pick up the tab and settle the bill. An emotional outburst in August could catch you off guard, but sociable alignments in October remind you just how much you need someone else. WORK AND MONEY It is absolutely, totally essential that you continue to focus on your prosperity — and career — with one hundred per cent commitment during February: indeed, that you do so for the whole of this year. The reason is that you have come to a time in your life when your need to make your mark in the world is stronger than ever. October brings your plans to fruition, so there's not long to wait! And it looks, as if November reveals a financial bonus — if all goes according to plan. Tip for the year Avoid giving offence in September and October. Explained | Why Gen Qassem Soleimani mattered 
TAURUS, The second half of the week should be best for most activities, mainly because on Wednesday and Thursday the Moon sends helpful messages to virtually the whole of your chart. At work, you may have to be more bureaucratic than usual. But, then, you have had your fill of artistic, creative, people! Horoscope 2020: Here is what is in store for you 
GEMINI, Home and working life are well-starred, but you're in such a restless mood that I imagine you'll be much happier being let off the leash and given the wherewithal to do whatever you like - exactly when you want. Remember not to break too many rules this week. Read | Horoscope Today, January 6, 2020: Aries, Capricorn, Taurus, Scorpio, Gemini, Libra, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces CANCER You are entering a prosperous phase, locked into remarkable financial circumstances that will bring windfalls at any time over the next year. When we look ahead, it is clear that news which is currently held up will be along in two or three weeks. 
LEO, So far, so good. You appear to have appeased a partner and put a rival off the scent. Yet, by next weekend, you'll have to prove that you can come up with the goods. You may already have been stunned by recent events. Whenever you get a chance, do lend younger relatives as much support as you can. 
VIRGO, There's no let-up from the secretive yet strangely moral and very rare planetary pattern which encourages you to do your best for other people - but without drawing attention to yourself. It's inevitable that you'll be exploited, but some of you will enjoy it! Relations must understand that you need to put yourself first. Tavleen Singh writes: A real leader needed 
LIBRA, You can throw yourself into the social whirl with hope for the future. And don't look back - in many ways the past is over. It's work and friends that offer the greatest excitement, rather than family gatherings or unsettled events at home. After all you've been through, you certainly deserve a good rest! 
SCORPIO, Take care. When your stars are so utterly and passionately open to emotional change, you can hypnotise others with your legendary intensity, yet you can give offence with your biting tongue. Once in a while, extremely advantageous financial stars come your way, but if you don't move quickly, you will lose out. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're not normally prone to nostalgia, but this could be just one of the many unexpected feelings that erupts this week as the planets trigger a rash of strange dreams and fantasies. At home, somebody will definitely be behaving very oddly indeed, so do be tolerant! Read | Army chief Naravane: An officer who is known to deliver 
CAPRICORN, A few disagreements at the beginning of the week should blow over quickly and will fail to dispel an aura of wealth and prosperity which blesses all of you except those determined to blow it. You are certainly much wiser now than you were a few months ago. AQUARIUS Envy is probably the most likely emotion of the moment, for other people do seem to be doing particularly well. Yet when the dust has finally settled, you will see how much you have gained. When all is said and done, you have a great deal to be proud of, and nobody can take that away.

TAURUS, Your romantic life seems to be dominated by secrecy and fantasy. So, even if you seem to be confident socially, it is likely that you are holding a great deal back. Don't be surprised if others misunderstand your motives! And don't be put out if a partner plans a practical joke. 
GEMINI, If current financial arrangements don't suit, you may now wish to back out. In fact, you may even be able to drop a few commitments, including emotional ones, without anybody noticing. You might conceivably see that what was once so important is now completely irrelevant. READ | General Qassem Soleimani killing: Unease in India over fallout, relations with US and Iran Cancer You are about to discover hidden business skills, and partners may be amazed at your ability to take shrewd decisions. A temporary obstacle or hold-up should pass fairly quickly, largely thanks to your own sensible attitudes. Oh, and don't take trivial matters too seriously. 
LEO, Colleagues, friends and relations all have their own ideas. Don't expect other people to roll over and say 'yes' to your every whim. It is essential that partners criticise your plans, for this is the only way that you'll work out exactly what you want. READ | No to CAA: Pinarayi asks 11 CMs to go Kerala way, Captain flags security risk 
VIRGO, The whole progress of events is now determined not by what you want, but by what others are doing. Look, listen and learn, for events beyond your control will throw up extremely useful opportunities. You might be aware of a friend's change of attitude before long. 
LIBRA, You are skilled in the art of compromise, but even your diplomatic talents could be stretched to the limit. It's always difficult being a perfectionist, and now you may have to consider backing down on a point of principle. Remember, compromise is a virtue. 
SCORPIO, You are in a decisive mood, but hidden pitfalls are everywhere. Social activities should be based around shared interests. Even a romantic relationship could blossom if you show enthusiasm for a loved one's favourite hobby, even if you do have to put on a fixed smile.

SAGITTARIUS, Mars makes its ambitious way around your chart, proclaiming that whatever the emotional complications, you can use your time in no better way than to get to grips with practical chores. The last thing you want to do at the moment is waste your time dealing with pointless rumours. 
CAPRICORN, Family gatherings should be at the top of the agenda, as should any improvements in domestic decor and decorations. Once you are happy that you have a pleasant place to relax, you will be able to tackle worldly ambitions. If you're in the right place at the right time you might even hear the news that changes your life. AQUARIUS You may hold the centre stage and occupy all the time and space you need to get your point across. There is still plenty to be accomplished at home and, whatever you think, you are now entering a busy phase, with commitments and responsibilities piling up. 
TAURUS, 'Seek and you will find', would seem to be a suitable motto at the moment. The whole point about this saying is that the quest for truth is an inner one: the answers lie with you and you alone. Today's lunar alignments are very busy, so take the opportunity to get ahead.

GEMINI, If you have the courage to live according to your principles, you will gain enormously in the long run. At work you should therefore make a point of putting other people's interests on a par with your own. A selfless attitude will earn respect and win allies. Cancer It's definitely time to stop dithering, banish any traces of self-doubt, and swing into action. Use every ounce of your charm and guile to promote your ambitions, and realise that you must now aim only for what you truly, deeply and genuinely desire. Horoscope Today: Read in Hindi 
LEO, It would be a shame if you were to be bogged down in petty arguments over who does what, or whose rights are being infringed, especially as this is in its essence such an open-hearted and adventurous period. There's bound to be the odd muddle at home, but don't let such irritations distract you from higher matters. READ | Two from fringe Hindu outfits among 6 held for killing Bihar teen in CAA protest: Police 
VIRGO, You probably feel a little as if you have been cut adrift and left to fend for yourself. That could be good, for if you have been left out, you'll have more time to quietly reconsider your future in preparation for imminent improvements. There are some extraordinary planetary patterns ahead, by the way, so don't imagine there are no more changes to come. 
LIBRA, You can sometimes seem to be aloof and a law unto yourself, but if you can possibly make other people see that you really do care, you will break down many barriers and open the way to a great new relationship. After all, good friends are worth far more to you than any amount of cash. Read | Prohibitory orders, Internet shut after clashes in Bengal district 
SCORPIO, You should be wary of people with big egos. It's not that somebody is likely to be a problem now, but that they might be getting more difficult in a week or so. Be cautious and play it by ear. As soon as you sense that trouble lies ahead, go out of your way to settle the underlying problems. 
SAGITTARIUS, Certain planets are likely to confuse personal issues, while others are urging you to act without thinking. It is, however, an excellent moment to put in train those unusual suggestions which you've kept to yourself until now. You never know — partners might actually be impressed. 
CAPRICORN, There's a great deal happening in your chart to do with technology, so aside from all the emotional and psychological ramifications of current transits, now is the time to stock up with the latest gadgets! A new gadget could even have a beneficial effect on your social life. AQUARIUS Fantastic planetary aspects are now fading, but they do retain some of their power to bring about lively meetings, unusual decisions and intriguing choices. Today you must begin to take the initiative rather than waiting for others to make up their minds. 
TAURUS, You may imagine that there is no way out of embarrassing situations, in which case it must be said that you are quite wrong. So much exists purely in your fantasy world at the moment, that you should hold back from making definite judgments about partners' thoughts and feelings. 
GEMINI, If you are still in a quandary over matrimonial or partnership affairs, the reason is because you're allowing your desire for status to influence your feelings. You should try to be less critical of partners'ambitions, and support them whatever they do. READ | No to CAA: Prasad tells states to seek better legal advice, Pinarayi hits back Cancer The overall planetary picture is extremely encouraging, even though you may have some doubts. Indeed, if you didn't have any worries about the future you wouldn't be human. You just have to realise that people who are behaving erratically are serving your life pattern, even if in their own curious way. 
LEO, There will be days when the odds seem to be stacked against you, and this might just be one of them. Look more closely, though, and you'll see that all you have to do is complete a certain number of essential tasks and everything will turn out fine.

VIRGO, You have had more than your fair share of financial problems in the past and, if these should now threaten to return, it could be because of bad management, especially where other people's money is concerned. Ask for advice and you'll be astonished how ready people are to help. 
LIBRA, Listen carefully to what other people are saying, mainly because for once their words and feelings seem to coincide. You can therefore afford to trust people who have proved their worth, and even hope that they'll make up for a past mistake - with your encouragement, of course. Explained: What are role, powers of CDS? 
SCORPIO, You must turn your attention to cash or career issues, but only because these areas of your life can be the subject of such intense emotions. It's important that you check out any area that has been ignored over the past fortnight, just to see that all's well. 
SAGITTARIUS, In a matter of days, you should have found out exactly how someone really does feel about you. This, of course, could come as something of a relief, for at last you will know where you stand. There are few people who can get the better of you, and many who should learn from your example. 
CAPRICORN, The scope for dramatic change at home is almost infinite. Forget what you're 'supposed'to do, realise that the rules are completely meaningless, and do what you know in your heart of hearts must now be accomplished. Try to convince people you live with that what is good for you is best for them. AQUARIUS The dominant planetary alignment is still thoroughly Aquarian, so you should be in your element at the present time. Surprisingly enough, there is no need for you to say what you mean, but do realise that partners could be equally inconsistent. 
TAURUS, You still have to ensure that you are not being taken for granted, and ever so gently you can begin to raise your profile in an important relationship. Remember, though, that your attitudes are coloured by the way you would like things to be, rather than how they are. Happy New Year 2020 Celebrations Live Updates 
GEMINI, One way to enhance your money-earning skills could be to link up with the latest technology. However, charitable giving is also moving up the agenda, and it's impossible to see whether you'll end up in the red or the black. What really matters, though, is that you feel you've done your bit for a better world. Cancer Developments that are due to come to light in a totally unexpected way could completely transform your appreciation of one special person. You may be pushed into reconsidering a whole series of emotional commitments. The one thing you can do without, though, is yet more personal complications. 
LEO, If you still feel under personal pressure, it's because you're stuck in a time warp that probably relates to what happened a month ago, or even longer. You must realise that the present moment is an ideal one in which to put all regrets behind you for good. Also Read | Exempt us from faculty quotas, IIMs tell govt 
VIRGO, Adverse or challenging planetary aspects do serve a useful purpose, and are forcing you to be a little more decisive. You should realise that while your most cherished goal may apparently be out of reach for now, there are many 'second-bests' that are within your grasp. 
LIBRA, It might be strange to hear it, but someone's opposition to your plans might actually have done you a service. During the past few weeks you have begun to find your feet. Most important now is your recognition that emotional relationships pervade every aspect of human activity, including work. 
SCORPIO, You should be concentrating on creating a better atmosphere at work, and encouraging more pleasant conditions all round. If your job involves people rather than things, you are poised to do very well indeed. Show colleagues that you are concerned with their interests and all should be well. Also Read | Rail fare goes up, new rates effective from today 
SAGITTARIUS, You still appear to be going through a slightly disturbed emotional situation, and one focus of attention seems to be financial. Quite simply, one way to feel better is to go out and buy yourself a few treats. What's more, you can pay for someone else's dreams to come true. 
CAPRICORN, Your stars are passing through an exciting phase. The effect may be to shoot you back to your emotional past just when you thought you had been propelled into the future! Don't take anything for granted, and look at wonderful promises with a large pinch of salt. AQUARIUS Don't expect to understand everything that's said and done today. In fact, if you think you do know what's going on, there's something badly wrong. Use this valuable time to forge ahead on all pursuits requiring wonderful, deep and colourful imagination. 
TAURUS, Social connections could involve legal complications. Just how or why this should be so is not clear, but you can help matters along by making sure that you know exactly what is your responsibility — and what is a partner's. Mind you, they might not agree with you. Happy New Year 2020 Celebrations Live Updates 
GEMINI, Your very personal business could appear to be someone else's problem, but you shouldn't believe everything you hear. At work there are ways to boost your income, but only if you approach the issues from a radically different direction. You may have to drag colleagues into the present, though. Cancer As soon as one relationship is ended another will begin, which must be good news. Yet, it may be your own attitudes which need attention, rather than the people you mix with. You can, if you wish, completely transform your feelings and behaviour within one special intimate partnership.

LEO, Sometimes the right words come out in the wrong way. Too much has been said in haste or in anger recently, and you should now find ways to recharge your emotional batteries. Try to find imaginative means of increasing your earning power, but remember to consult others at every step. 
VIRGO, One particular emotional involvement is now passing through a curious phase. What once seemed so true may now seem like a waste of time. You may feel free to speak your mind and put your foot down, and shouldn't be intimidated by others' ability to confuse the issues. Read | Protest damage notices: Uttar Pradesh goes where no state has gone before 
LIBRA, You're coming up to a critical moment for home and family relationships, and any and all positive changes ought now to be encouraged. There should soon be good news for those planning a move, and while financial matters look uncertain, you may need to reach the best agreement you can. 
SCORPIO, You may still have to consider long-term investments, but it's immediate cash concerns which need sorting out first. You're at your most persuasive, so you may try presenting proposals which have already been rejected, giving them an entirely different gloss. 
SAGITTARIUS, The climate is still much too volatile to settle on long-term plans. The current feeling that everything is up for grabs should suit your temperament, so you'll be tempted to put aside any lingering fears for your security. Keep partners informed as and when you feel it's necessary. 
CAPRICORN, There is intense pressure for constructive change across the board. You may be primed to benefit most if you are pursuing a creative line, or committed to any activity which is designed for self-improvement. Only the highest standards will do. AQUARIUS What you do with your private life is up to you. However, others may disagree. It's especially important to keep a dialogue going at home, all the more so if you want to keep parents or children on your side. If you try to go it alone then you'll almost certainly come unstuck. 
TAURUS, Life could be slightly expensive, but there's unlikely to be anything you can't handle. It's also a suitable moment for arranging social excursions, especially to the far corners of the globe. Perhaps, though, it's a voyage of the imagination which catches your fancy. 
GEMINI, A curious and lively period brings few direct planetary alignments, but plenty which make their presence felt in discreet, subtle avenues. As it happens, there will be myriad ways for you to dodge routine commitments and seek out fresh interests. Cancer You should spare a little extra time for health matters and resolve to improve your physical well-being. Although there are indications that you'll have plenty on your plate today, you make a point of considering your diet and exercise regime afresh. 
LEO, You may be struggling to keep private matters from becoming public. You might also have difficulty adjusting to normal daily life and changing circumstances. The way out of this trap is to change your attitude to your duties, and infuse everything you do with personal creative enthusiasm. It can be done. 
VIRGO, If other people are taking the lead, then this is a development most earnestly to be encouraged! You'll open up new vistas for the future if you follow where they tread, soaking up new experiences. One word of advice, though — don't believe everything that other people say about each other. 
LIBRA, It's a useful day for short journeys, discussions and interviews, but what seems to be more important is your ability to empathise with other people. That is, you should try to genuinely understand exactly how they feel. Then you might even be able to make decisions on their behalf. 
SCORPIO, It's not a bad day for shopping, and there could be the odd bargain on the horizon. However, even such trivial developments could start a train of events that eventually leads to completely unexpected results. Even a minor choice could have epic consequences. 
SAGITTARIUS, The ball is in your court today, so you may well have the upper hand. Realise, though, that with every stroke of good fortune comes a duty to others. The most useful thing you can do for yourself now is to change your emotional attitudes, looking at the demands you've been making of others. Perhaps you've not always been fair. 
CAPRICORN, There is everything to gain from spending some time alone, so don't feel bad about being secretive or keeping your feelings to yourself. In all discussions and debates express yourself forcefully, but without tipping over into aggression. AQUARIUS Partners or close companions still imagine that you will run true to form, but how wrong they are. This is an extraordinarily powerful week for you to defy all such misplaced expectations. Sooner or later a partner will realise that you were right. 
TAURUS, It would be the easiest thing in the world for you to blame other people for current worries. Yet you may be partly responsible yourself, largely on account of your failure to say what you're really feeling. If somebody is to be honest with you, you need to play fair with them. 
GEMINI, It is time once again to don your commander's hat in readiness for the battles to come. You may be very confident, for future conflicts have already been rehearsed. You'll therefore know exactly what's going on before it happens. At least, that's the theory! CANCER We come round to the time of month when home and family affairs must take the highest priority. Rather than squander a celestial opportunity, you should look around and see what improvements are necessary to maintain harmonious relationships. 
LEO, It's a time for travel and communication. Pick up that phone, write those letters, take that trip and get in touch. Financial discussions and decisions seem to be crucial. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, you'll get nowhere unless you've got the facts straight. 
VIRGO, You've done well, but it may be some time yet before you are able to pursue your most personal goals. If you're the type to plan ahead, set yourself a nine-month schedule. As for now, just get on and enjoy current relationships for all they're worth. 
LIBRA, You're in control today. The only drawback may be a tendency to be rather too emotional. Creative pleasures and social enjoyment both have their place, but deep inside you're looking for something else, something more meaningful. Hang on to your sense of humour. 
SCORPIO, The general planetary set-up may not be perfect, but it is very fortunate. Be sure to spend as much time as you need by yourself, for your spiritual batteries need recharging. Set your sights on solid long-term improvements at home, and don't let negative attitudes put you off. 
SAGITTARIUS, Throughout the coming months you will have to reform and clarify your opinions and attitudes. Friendly contacts over the next two days will give you an idea of how other people think, so look, listen and learn. You might discover something to your advantage. 
CAPRICORN, It would be wiser to avoid situations which make you tense or uneasy. On the other hand, it is true that the stars are on your side, bringing an air of worthwhile achievement and a feeling of goodwill whenever you take the right steps. Your conscience will be your guide. AQUARIUS You may find it possible to forget about emotional traumas. If so, you're lucky, for it will be easier to relax and enjoy today's positive romantic and social trends. Settle your spending plans over the next few days, and make your intentions abundantly clear. 
TAURUS, The current phase in the lunar month is always slightly tense, but you could be surprised at how well things turn out in the end. Your whole approach will soon be vindicated, possibly when children or younger relations finally realise how right you have been. Read | I-T says stamp duty evasion by family of EC Ashok Lavasa 
GEMINI, You're not out of the woods yet so keep your guard up. It is difficult to see whether you have been battling at work or at home, but it may be both. In this case, you should aim for a well-earned rest over the coming few days. Hopefully, a pressing commitment can be shelved. CANCER A stunning relationship between the Sun and Jupiter suggests a moment of supreme creativity, probably affecting financial matters, foreign contacts and ethical questions, not to mention educational possibilities. It goes without saying that benefits may accrue in all these areas. Also read | Oppn leaders slam Army chief CAA remark: Undermines civil-military relations 
LEO, Hopefully the way is now much clearer as far as monetary issues are concerned. If you have to rectify a financial situation, or any other personal matter, spare a little time for the finer points. Plus, you're closer to the resolution of a personal dilemma than you feared, but not necessarily in the manner you thought! 
VIRGO, If you need proof that you are on the right track, try asking close companions. People you live or work with day in and day out may have difficulty finding exactly the right words but, even when they're not telling the whole truth, you know what they really mean! Also read | UP protest in numbers: toll up to 19, over 1100 arrested, 5500 detained 
LIBRA, No doubt you are a mite confused. This is just as it should be, for the planets favour all things mysterious and unknown. However, they are also keeping you hard at work, so there is no time to muddle around! If a partner tries meddling in matters which are none of their business, then you'll be forced to redefine your boundaries. 
SCORPIO, Let things take their own course and you'll save yourself all sorts of trouble. If you have a mind for your own survival, you'll leave strangers, partners, friends, lovers and acquaintances to solve their own silly quibbles! Don't let them hold you back. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may have taken a moderate battering, but I think it's now safe to lift your head above the trenches. You may even make a few moves behind the scenes which will set you up for future prosperity. Don't bank on quick profits though, for initial impressions are bound to be misleading. 
CAPRICORN, Seldom have you been in such a strong position to name your price or dictate your terms. For once you have both the facts and their deeper implications at your disposal, which means you're one step ahead of everyone else. It's all a question of finding the right way to say what you want. AQUARIUS You may soon find yourself back to square one over a financial or professional matter. Actually this is a good thing, and you should also make it your goal to get back to the roots in your emotional life. Once you've established a sense of certainty then you'll be free to experiment. 
TAURUS, The Moon moves into a supportive position, so there's hope that one or two difficult situations may have resolved themselves. Perhaps news of this will arrive during the day. If you're waiting on other people's decisions, then recent delays should soon be dealt with. Solar Eclipse 2019 LIVE: Annular solar eclipse in parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu 
GEMINI, Certain people appear to have under-estimated your ingenuity. They might also have misunderstood your determination to succeed. If so, you may now accept that you have total control in one particular relationship, but also a few attendant obligations. After all, rights always carry responsibilities. CANCER The Sun, Moon and Mars form a series of alliances which should keep you on the move. But even if you're confined to base-camp your mind will be buzzing with new ideas. Observe these rules and you won't go far wrong: follow all directions meticulously, give others the benefit of the doubt and pay no heed to rumours. 
LEO, I wouldn't be surprised if a complete stranger gives you a hard time today. Even people you thought you knew well will be a mite touchy, so chart a careful course, especially if money is involved. The last thing you want to do now is end up out of pocket. 
VIRGO, There is obviously a loss or an emotional hurt from the past that still festers. However, you shouldn't let such memories influence your attitudes to the present, especially in view of today's rather delicate situation. If surprising news arrives then watch your reaction - and don't jump to instant conclusions. Also Read | Slowdown puts a question mark on 14 per cent GST compensation 
LIBRA, You may have made quite a number of useful adjustments recently, but whether you can really expect others to play the game your way is a question that must remain open. Keep ethical issues and foreign contacts under review - just in case something turns up! 
SCORPIO, Your stars are particularly active today. It seems certain that you will be tempted to undertake a risk of some sort. Whether you win or lose is much less important than that you learn the required lessons. That way you'll carry the experience forward to new situations. 
SAGITTARIUS, Even if you imagine you are in the right, you should go out of your way to placate and pacify partners. The problem is, you can't tell in advance whether it is to be colleagues, friends or family whose feathers need smoothing down. Sensitivity is required! Also Read | Sambhar lake may have been lethal electric trap when birds arrived 
CAPRICORN, Communication holds the key, and for once local calls are as important as long-distance. When you step outside your front door there is no way of knowing whether your trip will take you to the nearest corner, or to the furthest recesses of the globe! AQUARIUS As new planetary patterns come into play you will have to alter some of your preconceptions. You may, for example, be more prepared to back up your hunches with hard cash. At the very least you must look at what you need to guarantee your security. 
TAURUS, It doesn't matter whether your current problems are intensely personal - or strictly public and professional. All that matters is that you adopt an open-hearted approach and welcome other people into your confidence. You'll be unhappy with any actions which require deception, however small. 
GEMINI, Fortunately consultation with others comes naturally to you, but if I may make a gentle observation, you are not always that good at listening to other people's responses. Today you must take all advice to heart, even if it feels as if you've heard it all before. Also Read | Amit Shah says no NPR-NRC link, his Govt linked it 9 times in House CANCER It's said that you can't jump in the same river twice. This ancient riddle is an astrological truth which makes enormous sense at the moment: the same conditions will never return, so you must plan for the future, not live in the past. In other words, life is not a rehearsal! 
LEO, It may be in your best interests to wait a while longer before taking too much on trust or finalising personal arrangements. Also, you should now accord partners more respect than has sometimes been the case. It's the least that they deserve, but it will also reflect well on you. Also Read | First notices go out in UP to 28 residents: Pay Rs 14 lakh for damage to property 
VIRGO, It is not like you to do things on the spur of the moment, but you are now entering a period of maximum impatience in your relationships and at work. Be sure that if you disturb a professional partnership, the results are as desired. Remember the old saying: act in haste, repent at leisure! 
LIBRA, If you have raised your sights to the higher questions, those involving ethics and morality, even schemes which recently appeared to be fraught with obstacles could become a great deal easier. You should take some of the credit, but so should someone who has given you good, if uncomfortable, advice. 
SCORPIO, Mercury, planet of deep thought, is now intriguingly aligned with your sign. You must now therefore develop original ideas. More than that, you may benefit from the absolute determination to reject anything that no longer suits your mood.

SAGITTARIUS, You're a complex person, but then you don't need me to tell you that. If you wish, you may continue the rules and habits of a lifetime and maintain a sense of imaginative chaos at home. If anyone tries to make you follow their ideas, just smile sweetly and ignore them. 
CAPRICORN, Strong financial indications continue but with a distinctly problematic set of circumstances. Either you'll make an enormous profit or you'll be ripped off - there is no middle way. However, play your cards with great care and you'll undoubtedly pick up a nice bargain. AQUARIUS If you have your wits about you at present, you can soon finally agree a deal or transaction which has been uppermost in your mind for a very long time. You may, though, have to fill in the details at a later date. Next week should do it, so make your plans immediately. 
TAURUS, The continuing relationship between Venus, planet of love, and Jupiter, ruler of expansion, should lift your morale and expand your romantic horizons. Please remember that you may feel as sentimental about places as about people, and a nostalgic journey could be just the thing to restore your morale. 
GEMINI, You are in an extremely strong position to air your grievances - as long as you are diplomatic. What's more, you can also do something about them. Other people may object but, if they're honest with themselves, they'll realise the truth about the situation. And not before time, you might think! CANCER This is hardly a convenient time in many respects, but then you're used to juggling different arrangements and contradictory pressures. The trouble is that you could run up large bills without noticing. So, keep an eye on potential social costs. 
LEO, You may keep your attention on long-term ambitions, but vary your strategy. Perhaps you can forget about making the grade for a while and concentrate on offering other people a helping hand. Your future is assured, but theirs is not. Realise that, while partners' difficulties may seem small to you, to them they will soon seem insuperable. 
VIRGO, Extroverted, outgoing influences combine in equal measure with introverted, inward-looking ones. Perhaps this means that you'll take control in secret. It could also mean that this is an ideal day for spiritual reflection - or just for spending time by yourself. 
LIBRA, Your social stars are supreme, encompassing the entire range of human contacts under their beneficial glow, from casual meetings with strangers to passionate encounters of the most intimate kind. Why not let your barriers down and enjoy yourself? 
SCORPIO, Make an early start and set your sights high, as high, in fact, as you possibly can. If professional schemes are afoot, today's prospects are as near perfect as you can expect this week. It's important to cultivate friendly relationships, even with rivals. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should be able to move one step closer to your aims at home, which means that you should now level with loved ones and explain your intentions. Rather than try and fill in all the facts, give people a general picture, and let them share your vision of a better future. 
CAPRICORN, You should find it much easier to improve any ties which have held you back at work. You could also find that there are just not enough hours in the day! Over-commit yourself if necessary: take on more than you can cope with now and you'll learn a million vital lessons for the future! AQUARIUS You will need all the charm you can muster if you are to save yourself from a financial hole, or maximise the impact of a brilliant bargain. I don't need to remind you that it's appearances that count when you're deciding between different people - and when they're judging you. 
TAURUS, Venus, your planetary ruler is forming some easy relationships, but also some difficult ones. At the heart of this paradox lie a vital contradiction and a complicated relationship. I think you'll have the last laugh in all personal disputes, no matter how complex they are. 
GEMINI, A good general never underestimates his, or her, enemy. So please do not make the mistake of imagining that other people are talking nonsense, otherwise you will, sooner or later, fall flat on your face. Besides, questions which have been running round and round in your mind are unlikely to be resolved just yet. CANCER I have two good forecasts today. First, you will overcome all obstacles. Second, there should be no new obstacles in any case! But there's another dimension that I need to mention, one related to that nebulous planet, Neptune. This suggests that you might not notice what's staring you in the face. Jharkhand Election Results 2019 LIVE Updates 
LEO, If at all possible, delay the launch of a major venture until you are absolutely ready. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't continue with preparations. Quite the contrary: there is much to be done if you are to ensure your eventual success. Just don't box yourself in. 
VIRGO, I'd like to look at your long-term cycles for a moment and point out that within nine months you will be free from much that you currently find so restricting or aggravating. Needless to say, patience is required. And then there's the little matter of the fact that people you live with seem to be stuck in the past. Don't worry: it will pass. 
LIBRA, It's not your professional skills which shine today, but personal gifts. You do have the perfect opportunity to grasp the reins at work, but it's partly due to your underrated considerate and compassionate qualities. Why not let other people know that you really do care? Also Read | Reality check: Before PM Modi's distancing from pan-India NRC, there was Amit Shah's underlining 
SCORPIO, After so much irritation and mischief-making by partners and family members, you probably expect less from other people than you ought to. It may be another few days at least before you can say your piece and redress the balance. There's no hurry, so don't rush it unduly. 
SAGITTARIUS, It now seems that you are anxious to change your lifestyle, though I should think that any adjustments will be relatively minor. It's almost just a question of shifting the furniture and replacing a few heirlooms. It's amazing how a sufficient number of small improvements add up to a major transformation. 
CAPRICORN, You have become aware that you cannot always be the giver. Sometimes you must be the one who takes. Yet today you may have to grin and bear it as other people once again seem to have the advantage. Wait until tomorrow! And ignore those people who tell you that 'tomorrow never comes'! Explained: What NRC+CAA means to you? AQUARIUS It's a busy day in a rather trivial, routine sense, and quite an emotional one as well, but that's not what's really significant. Far more important is the necessity to realise that whether you stand or fall is now entirely due to you. That knowledge should give you the incentive you need to pull through. —— 
TAURUS, Your best bet is to continue to conserve your energies and not try to force the pace. Your stars are so favourable that you should be carried along by celestial energies without any additional effort. A romantic adventure may now be taken to a new level of excitement. And be sure to give other people their due. 
GEMINI, As one day gives way to another, so your desires shift from one stage to the next. The Moon winds the week up in a suitably supportive region of your chart, which should mean that all aspects of your life, personal and professional, will end on a thoroughly favourable note. CANCER It's the personal life which matters most at the moment. Please give friends a sympathetic hearing and allow loved ones as much time and space as they need. Although public affairs seem to be more important at the beginning of the week, personal ambitions are the strongest. Later may be best for shrewd financial decisions. 
LEO, Current planetary aspects and influences are exciting all that is liveliest and most restless in your nature. Now that finances are on a happier footing, you'll be able to pay your own way. Romantically speaking, your planets couldn't be better, but you still seem to be held back by the past. Please realize that the present is important! 
VIRGO, There seem to be some changes afoot at home, so please give domestic matters your full attention. All sectors of your horoscope ruling money are growing in importance, with the result that there will be times when you will be able to think of little else over the coming four weeks. 
LIBRA, The Sun is in a very friendly region, so it's a pleasant time, celestially speaking, for Librans. The planetary formations are looking mixed, but you have a talent for drawing the best out of good situations and minimising the bad in difficult situations. Money matters are looking fairly positive, so you can turn a loss into a profit. 
SCORPIO, Although certain recent social or community involvements will become permanent fixtures, you're finally moving out of a recent, powerful, social phase. Looking ahead, for the next month, you will revert to the secretive Scorpio we know and love. You have kept a secret for long enough  but now may not be the best time to come clean. 
SAGITTARIUS, Family matters are entering a more settled phase. Plus, at long last, you have mastered certain tricky professional matters, and offered due support and assistance to a partner. Now you can appreciate the benefit of an increasingly lively social existence. Hopefully you have the cash in your pocket to subsidise your tastes. 
CAPRICORN, It's time to lift your sights from mundane matters. The next few weeks offer you a crucial chance to complete all important plans and arrangements which have educational implications, legal ramifications or overseas connections. Travel stars remain bright, but you must remember to check all details yourself. Leave nothing to chance. AQUARIUS Start by focusing on personal matters, and see to it that family members are happy with your plans. Although short-term money matters, including shopping, spending and saving, should be wrapped up by the weekend, long-term issues remain vitally important until after next month. Long-distance journeys are a fine idea. 
TAURUS, There still seems to be too much uncertainty about personal decisions and choices. There really is no point in trying to get others to sign on the dotted line just yet. There is plenty of time before final arrangements must be reached, so wait and see what happens next week. 
GEMINI, If you have your wits about you, and you certainly should, nobody will be able to get the better of you or pull the wool over your eyes. You may be angry one minute, the very essence of charm the next. If other people are confused, it's because they can't keep up with you! CANCER Partners or close companions are certainly not as cold or hostile as they sometimes seem. Your best policy is to stop worrying about other people and look after your own affairs. Once you have sorted out your top priorities and principles then you will be able to extend proper help to those in need. 
LEO, If you ever dreamt of living overseas or far from home, now could be the perfect moment to investigate the available options. Also, do make sure that any travel plans are sufficiently adventurous to satisfy your bold and confident spirit. Also, be sure to listen to an older relation's words of wisdom. 
VIRGO, You're entitled to feel annoyed, but your behaviour should be carefully considered. You are torn between making a public song and dance on the one hand, and keeping yourself to yourself on the other. Perhaps you should wear your mystical or spiritual convictions on your sleeve. 
LIBRA, Your best option is to take expert or legal advice before you go any further. Your social optimism should be boundless, but you may be so carried away that you double-book yourself or otherwise take on too many commitments. Catch up with old friends - someone is waiting to hear from you. 
SCORPIO, Contentment, it is said, comes from total immersion in worthwhile activities. This should be a busy day, one to take on more responsibilities. You may stretch yourself to the limit, for the more you accomplish now, the more time you will have to relax and enjoy yourself over the coming days. 
SAGITTARIUS, The winds of change are blowing through your relationships. The whole point about the current situation is that you must learn to listen. You must also try to understand other people's feelings and points of view without being unnecessarily judgmental. 
CAPRICORN, Some of the strongest regions in your chart concern home, work and money. The problem is how best to integrate all these different areas. One interpretation suggests that if you work harder, you'll be able to pay for an improvement at home sooner than you thought. AQUARIUS It's an ideal day for short excursions and meetings, and pleasant agreements could be concluded. Insist that everyone conforms to your ideas as to what is practical and possible, and they all will prosper. However, whether they agree with you is another matter! 
TAURUS, Mercury has now withdrawn from its one relationship with your sign, only to replace it with another, so a great deal of what has been said in haste or anger may now be considered no more than water under the bridge. There's no use in dwelling on the past. 
GEMINI, Venus, a planet with a critical and benevolent role in your affairs, is now coming to your aid, which means that, personally and professionally, you have too much going for you to be sidetracked by people who don't understand you. You might even end up making a profit. CANCER An emotional tie or attachment may now be reconsidered. The point is that important planetary pressures have been lifted, which means that you may take a fresh look at all current relationships. If anything seems to be bothering you, it's that a partner's sincerity is open to doubt. Give them time to explain themselves. Also Read | Protests against NRC and CAA move beyond campus 
LEO, Just to look at the minus points in what is otherwise a very positive situation, I am concerned that you might become too selfish and demanding emotionally. This will not serve your cause, so watch it! You'd do better to start by asking partners what they want. 
VIRGO, Those of you chasing professional success should feel confident that, even if applications don't succeed, they all represent vital steps on the path, or rungs on the ladder, if you prefer. You'll be keeping your romantic secrets, perhaps because you sense that someone is not ready to hear what you have to say. Also Read | First time, Internet, voice, SMS shut down in Delhi 
LIBRA, It's time to give a special message to all you artistic and creative types, whatever your particular forte: this is no time for wild self-expression, but rather for practical skills and traditional disciplines. You'll never make a dream come true unless you work at it. 
SCORPIO, What other people often fail to realise is that you can be extremely good at building up a shrewd grasp of the facts, a quality which means that you are about to experience certain very important advantages in the financial arena. Stick to your guns. 
SAGITTARIUS, An entire group of planets is now encouraging you to go forth and multiply, metaphorically speaking of course! Spread yourself as widely as possible and let the whole world share in your hope and faith in the future. Traditional values will sustain your vision of a better world. 
CAPRICORN, When it comes to long-term finances, timing is of the essence. Do not be tempted to follow get-rich-quick schemes. The lure of instant winnings may be nothing more than an illusion, so be patient. When a loved one comes to you with a spending plan, tell them to think again! Also Read | Post-Millennials turn millionaires at IPL auction AQUARIUS To those who know you, you are often an exciting person to be around, encouraging change in all things, even though your actions are often very helpful and positive. However, it may now be your turn to stick to the past and hang on to what you know best. 
TAURUS, Circumstances beyond your control may be compelling you into family arrangements which are not of your choosing. If you find current developments unwelcome it would be very useful to check out any little way in which you have yourself contributed to the situation. 
GEMINI, Life is moving on day by day and week by week, and you will soon need to be an expert on everything. The more you know, the better off you'll be, so you'll have to keep the facts at your fingertips. You'll also need to understand the inner meaning of today's events! CANCER You needn't expect to have your usual amount of drive and determination over the next few weeks. It seems increasingly obvious that you are heading for a period which is ideal for rest, reflection and recuperation. Your zest for life is soon to increase, so enjoy it. READ | ABVP in a bind as ‘harassment' videos by members go viral 
LEO, It is difficult not to be totally awestruck by the truly splendid pattern which is now building up in your sign. The good news is that there is more to come, but when you are showered with opportunities, as you will soon be, you must learn to discriminate between what is worthwhile and what is not. 
VIRGO, Astrological tradition has it that you are deeply concerned with the movement and subtle phases of Mercury. According to this planet, your mood is now to become more analytical and communicative, which should do you a power of good. Look after yourself - you deserve only the best! READ | Another CM opposes NRC: Naveen Patnaik latest, after his party voted for CAB 
LIBRA, Children and younger relatives need a firm hand. The stars indicate a need for authority, yet in my opinion they are a mite too inflexible. You may therefore wish to be absolutely firm as regards your principles, but judge each situation on its merits. 
SCORPIO, Financial affairs will soon require more thought. Among other things, this means that you must talk to partners about your spending plans. Tell them what you're doing and they'll almost certainly go along with you. Your romantic hopes are rising, by the way, but they may be too high to be met. 
SAGITTARIUS, The romantic situation is looking positively rosy, although it does seem that, if one arrangement is to be confirmed, there must be a break in another. You can at least maintain an atmosphere of goodwill and cooperation with a particular person, even if your spirit has moved on.

CAPRICORN, If you take on too many new engagements or projects, you may let yourself in for a number of false starts. It could be far better to stick with what you know and concentrate on building up your future security. Then, you'll be able to launch an adventurous initiative from a firm base. AQUARIUS Your daily transits indicate the need to complete shopping and financial exercises first, and then discuss the relevant issues and consequences. Do yourself a favour and look for ways to make life more enjoyable. And don't be annoyed by unreliable partners or colleagues. They may not be able to help it! 
TAURUS, You don't usually let the world see just how astute you can be. Yet recently you've come out with some very strange ideas which all of us can learn from. You are now ready to start dictating the pace at home. Begin by clearing up all muddles, misunderstandings and mess left over from the past. 
GEMINI, Professional influences remain strong and helpful, so you may, if you wish, allow work to take care of itself. It looks as if much of what happens over the coming two months will be based around endless meetings, interviews or conferences. Get your story ready. CANCER You have endured partnership conflicts, restlessness and estrangements, but this is all part of the crazy dialogue with your sign, set up by the celestial awkward squad - Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. If you wish, you may now put emotional complications to one side. READ | Irfan Pathan: It's our responsibility, for our sanity, to stay calm and spread love 
LEO, Pull out all the stops and spend whatever is necessary to pay for your dreams. It doesn't matter whether you have one pound or dollar or a million, or whether you have any cash at all - in any currency! What's important is that you allow yourself a morale-boosting treat. 
VIRGO, Planetary activity over the next few days allows you to wallow in a bout of sentiment and romance. Also, you'd do well to devote a great deal of attention to establishing just what makes other people tick. Once you've found out, then you'll be able to give them what they want. 
LIBRA, You're facing the old dilemma - whether to compromise, or not! If you decide to insist that you get your own way socially, you must show other people that you have just cause. If you don't know what you're talking about, you'll soon be found out. This is no time to bluff! READ | Both government and BJP underline NRC but dial down the rhetoric, for now 
SCORPIO, There is an increasing tendency towards silly accidents, a fact I point out solely so that you can take more care when handling priceless people or possessions. It's all down to carelessness, so the remedy is simple: watch out! And keep an eye open for an employer who is now on the warpath. 
SAGITTARIUS, Business and pleasure can merge in mysterious ways. Complete all purchases of luxury items or investments in the arts or any other frivolous area. By the same token, agreements and arrangements affecting your working conditions must be finalised. 
CAPRICORN, It's a fair enough day for making applications, attending interviews and handling discussions, and you can do well if you're selling ideas. On the romantic front, certain emotional complications should by now have died down or have come to seem strangely irrelevant. READ | Shriram Lagoo: ‘Rare actor, highly intelligent, had logic to apply to character' AQUARIUS There are so many awkward alignments in your horoscope that some of you may be feeling a little bewildered and hard done-by. Perhaps it's time to remind you that according to every tenet of your birth sign, you thrive on a challenge! In fact, there's nothing worse than having nothing to do! 
TAURUS, You are now officially in a period of maximum domestic uncertainty. Let me tell you now that friction will only develop if you battle to keep things as they are. If you accept and even initiate change over the next two months, the consequences could be miraculous. 
GEMINI, Get down to some serious work as soon as you can. By serious, I don't mean that it shouldn't be fun, but that anything you do now will be tied in to your destiny. I'd also advise a spot of day-dreaming if required! You might think that this is wasting time, but it's a great way to create space for new ideas. CANCER Once you've dealt with financial matters, probably no more than routine shopping, you'll be free to let your mind wander. Overseas contacts seem to be important, which means that a family member far away is waiting to hear from you. Plus, an adventurous possibility is on the way. Also Read | As students protest across country, PM Modi warns against ‘vested interests' 
LEO, To be forewarned, as they say, is to be forearmed. It's therefore important to point out that even though you are entering a phase of unparalleled optimism, some of your hopes may be unrealistic. You must sort out what is possible from what is not. 
VIRGO, The following applies to your life over the next two months, so don't forget it: you are increasingly likely to feel exploited or undermined and will tend to blame other people, yet the cause, and hence the solution, lies with you. Once you've taken that on board then you'll be well on the way to finding a solution. 
LIBRA, The day seems to be divided into two halves, and you can swing to extremes either favoring self-indulgence or putting the emphasis on work. Certain people are convinced that you have a lazy streak, and now may be a good time to prove them right! Don't let them pressurize you! Also Read | If you don't consider us citizens, we don't consider you as govt: Kanhaiya on Citizenship Law 
SCORPIO, Don't complain if you have been disappointed financially. There will be plenty of chances to make up for it later on, perhaps within a few days. Actually, self-indulgence should be a priority, perhaps because it's when you're enjoying yourself that you come up with the answers to rather serious questions. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's bound to be some time before you can fully recover from past disturbances, but, in almost exactly one week, you should be able to more than makeup for one particular mistake. In fact, it's an astrological law that each time the same opportunity returns, we make better of it. Also Read | Lt Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane set to be next Army Chief 
CAPRICORN, Others may make extravagant gestures, but you ought to be the one to call time on reckless financial adventures. Every single penny, cent, rupee or peseta you spend must be designed to earn two back in the future. You can't guarantee success, but you can do your best. AQUARIUS While one very important planet, Saturn, urges you to dig your heels in, this could be a risky strategy. For the next twelve weeks, compromise and total flexibility must be an essential part of your strategy. Follow the Jupiterian path - the way of hope and optimism. 
TAURUS, You should say what needs to be said now, while you still have time. This is not to say that if you leave it till the end of the week it will be too late, only that right now you don't actually have to know what you're talking about, which is rather convenient! 
GEMINI, A snap decision may be vital if you are to take full advantage of prosperous financial possibilities. The relevant celestial influences overlap very briefly, so your sense of timing will have to be impeccable if you are to snap up a bargain. Stick to your high standards, though. CANCER If charm is called for, don't sit on the fence while life passes you by. Get out there now, smile sweetly, bat your eyelids and make sure that other people give in to your every whim. If there's any one rule in astrology this week, it's that the higher your hopes, the richer your achievements. 
LEO, It's strange the way the planets gradually assemble for the great celestial performances of the year. Right now, Venus, planet of love, a major player on the cosmic stage, is about to intervene in your affairs in a big way. It could even bring a very interesting new person into your life. 
VIRGO, Both personal and joint financial issues are relatively free from astrological pressures at the moment, at least as far as your solar chart is concerned. One reading of this situation is that you may reshape and redirect your investments, savings and income for the better. 
LIBRA, There are increasing signs of social stress. This is not a bad thing, I hasten to add, for the planets are perfectly placed to give that additional determination you need to get your own way. Or, do you really want to do your best for others? If so, get on with it! 
SCORPIO, It's difficult to make precise delineations of your sign at the moment, because while most of you are still being wound up like a coiled spring, others are just about to explode. Exciting times indeed! All the stars ask is that you avoid unnecessary risks. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you acknowledge that partners have the advantage, you will avoid the temptation to try and take over - and will steer clear of a minor humiliation. Far better to get on with your own personal affairs in the knowledge that, with the right degree of co-operation, this could be a marvellous time. 
CAPRICORN, If you have been storing your feelings up, please relax and tell someone exactly how you feel about them. I know you are naturally reserved, but you must understand that you are in danger of letting a golden opportunity slip by. Keep an eye open for passing offers. AQUARIUS If new routines or methods are to be discussed, you may find that the personal situation becomes rather complicated. The problem probably lies with other people, who are constantly adjusting their opinions. But, then, it's your responsibility to keep up, isn't it? 
TAURUS, Most things will depend on the state of your closest relationships. You must recognise that friends will have high standards on which they will refuse to compromise in any way. If you put a foot out of place, you may be subject to a great deal of criticism, but you will be completely justified if you reply in kind; so, stand up for yourself! 
GEMINI, Important stars are moving into your financial houses and, before long, you will become much more concerned about money. Indeed, it looks as if this is going to be an expensive period and you will have to work hard to juggle your resources. There are, however, ways and means to boost your earnings. One is to increase your savings! CANCER This is potentially a superb period for intense romantic encounters, as those two super-charged planets, macho Mars and passionate Pluto, are stirring you to your depths. Over the next three to four weeks, you may be rather more preoccupied by work, which could therefore cut into your social engagements. 
LEO, Do please make a point of healing emotional rifts. As we move forward, your morale will be buoyed up by the energetic planet Mars' role in a creative and romantic sector of your horoscope, a sure sign that you'll be straining at the leash. On the other hand, there'll be no let-up at work just yet. 
VIRGO, This promises to be a vitally important period at home and, as a result of recent lunar alignments, you'll have a chance to make a clean break and a fresh start. There are also indications that some of you are now becoming more interested in politics, especially in any developments that affect your immediate environment. 
LIBRA, This is no time for complacency. Far from it! In fact, the most important consideration is that you formulate all your plans very carefully and confer closely with partners. An impatient, know-it-all attitude will surely get you into a lot of trouble when you forget to look into even the most fundamental details. 
SCORPIO, You could be in for some good luck, money-wise. You may be surprised to hear that this is an inevitable consequence of the annual gathering of planets in parts of your chart relevant to your finances. You may as well throw caution to the wind and spend whatever needs to be spent to guarantee a memorable social experience. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your personal astrological year hits a regular-turning point around now. The Moon's movements have a profound impact on all your bodily cycles and this is therefore a period of dramatic fluctuations in your energy. Whether other people can handle your intensity is an open question, but not one to which you should devote undue attention. 
CAPRICORN, You're facing one of those near-perfect planetary formations which combine to open new horizons and broaden your mind. This time it is optimistic Jupiter, energetic Mars and obsessive Pluto, which exert their combined impact on the Capricornian personality. The resulting pattern is one which is at the same time extraordinarily tough and extremely harmonious. AQUARIUS The planets are forming a series of very powerful patterns, bunching together in several regions of your solar chart. You will therefore be pulled in a number of sharply conflicting personal directions and will have the choice whether to concentrate on one alone, or to try and weld them all together into a complete package. 
TAURUS, It's time to forget about behaviour or actions by friends which have offended your pride. Instead, why don't you astound everybody with your determination to strike out on an entirely new path? It's a fine moment for a spot of shopping therapy, by the way, which is another way of saying, indulge your harmless desires. 
GEMINI, This looks like one of those days when helping yourself is as important as helping others. The curious feature of today's idealistic planetary patterns is that selfless service to others can do you good. You'll also figure out how to handle a domestic responsibility. CANCER Spending plans may require urgent attention, possibly because you've over-committed yourself in the past. However, don't feel pressurised into acting against your better judgment. Younger relations need your support, by the way, so lend a helping hand. READ | Q/A: Citizenship amendment law, decoded 
LEO, Given that this isn't the best day for arranging travel plans, if you are embarking on an unavoidable journey you must be sure to take elementary precautions. Check instructions, directions and other details. Family and friendly developments come together at last. 
VIRGO, It would be false to say that recent efforts have all been in vain. However, you may be wondering just where it is all leading. Try to look at the broader picture. A foreign or legal connection may hold the key to your family's future, so keep an eye open for long-distance developments. 
LIBRA, You're not often described as a free thinker, but such is the nature of the planetary patterns which will soon be affecting your life, that you should spare no effort in your quest for new personal ambitions and lifestyles. The future begins today! READ | Former CEA: It is India's Great Slowdown, economy seems headed for the ICU 
SCORPIO, You obviously feel that you have been led up the garden path, but this is a common experience for people born under the influence of your sign. You should try to be more trusting, and not quite so ready to dismiss people on your first impressions. 
SAGITTARIUS, Any tension in your partnerships could be a dynamic force for change. This is a time to mix as widely as possible and soak up influences you'd normally shun. You're also likely to make big advances in your business plans, though take it one careful step at a time. 
CAPRICORN, Even though you still feel that others are being inconsiderate, their intentions may be perfectly honourable. It's down to you to break the deadlock by making suggestions which other people will feel obliged to accept. Make someone an offer they can't refuse! READ | Mardaani 2 review: Shivani Shivaji Roy is a necessary protagonist AQUARIUS If you look back, you will see that the past year has been a time of struggles and conflicts as well as rewards and achievements. Your most important gain has been an increase in maturity and depth of experience. That is now going to make you almost invincible. 
TAURUS, Conditions at work could be giving cause for concern, although it may be difficult to put your finger on exactly what seems to be the matter. It's the current lunar situation that is responsible for bringing more unsettled circumstances, but you'll ride out the storm. 
GEMINI, Continuing financial influences of a slightly shady nature should caution you to keep everything absolutely crystal clear and above-board. The last thing you want to do at this stage is to commit yourself to hidden costs. In that case, I'd recommend you seek support from the people who matter most. CANCER A partner may call you to account for your actions, so make sure you have a convincing story ready. Check through past promises to see that you've left nothing uncompleted. Only once all unfinished emotional business has been tidied up can you move forward with confidence. 
LEO, It's a busy day, with rapidly-moving planets spurring you on to more and more activity. Keep a watchful eye on a number of interesting investments as partners will be making financial demands. Once you have settled money matters, you'll be ready to set your romantic priorities. Follow UK election voting LIVE updates 
VIRGO, Activities from long ago could become a source of renewed interest. However, you should be under no illusions that you can get away without paying your dues, as your financial stars are looking decidedly shaky at the moment. You can delay the inevitable, though! 
LIBRA, It would be foolish to pretend that everything that takes place in your personal life will be easy, or that partners will welcome your plans with open arms. Try to be tolerant of other people's changing moods. Otherwise, you will find that a partner may pull the rug from under your feet. 
SCORPIO, The fact that you might be feeling under the weather today, reminds you that this is a useful time of year to focus on your physical health and to take whatever steps are necessary to get back into shape, including giving up all those bad habits. Also Read | Citizenship Amendment Bill: As protests flare, murmurs in govt over ‘error of judgement' 
SAGITTARIUS, Domestic disharmony may be unfortunate but can produce positive results if it forces you to face up to the underlying causes of discontent. Exactly what have you been up to make people feel the way they do? And is there anything you can do to turn the clock back? I think so! 
CAPRICORN, It's a confusing day to go travelling, which means that it's up to you to be crystal clear about all instructions and directions. Guard against misunderstandings by sticking to the facts. And do make it absolutely certain that you give partners the benefit of the doubt in return. AQUARIUS Try to realise that what has been agreed recently is still private, and is not due to be made public just yet. Therefore you still have time to ask for suitable amendments before everything is signed and sealed. I think you have a right to expect partners to take your desires into account. 
TAURUS, The financial picture is confusing. It's very much up to how you play your cards as to whether you make massive gains or incur a large loss, so be very careful and stick to tried and tested methods. You're in a strong position, by the way, so you should have the confidence to pursue your personal goals. 
GEMINI, Allow yourself the odd theatrical outburst. The general trend today is for people to say what they want, when they want, with a minimum of thought. I can see no reason why you shouldn't take the lead! You can also, if you wish, seize the moral high ground. CANCER Today's lunar aspects will bring stressful conditions, mainly because you've got to make up your mind and choose between sharply different options. Yet, unlike some of your close friends, you may feel your energy lifted by a surge of emotional power. You may actually be in an optimistic mood! 
LEO, If you don't take steps voluntarily to resolve a financial question, you will be literally pushed into taking emergency action by today's dramatic lunar movements. The costs could be high, but the emotional toll could be higher. That's why you've got to be easy on yourself. 
VIRGO, You may have to revise plans to take a trip, or reassess the value of an overseas connection. Among the important considerations will be the question of whether a certain personal desire fits in with your higher principles. This is a roundabout way of saying that you might have to compromise. 
LIBRA, It seems inevitable that the coming days will be dominated by concerns of both a private and a professional nature, and you may feel caught on the horns of a dilemma, unsure where to turn. I suspect that the best course is to wait while events take their course and partners work out what they want. 
SCORPIO, In spite of the fact that you're generally known as a cautious person, you have a surprising tendency to waste your money. There seems little doubt that your mood over the coming few days will be extravagant and self-indulgent, and your secret plans could cost more than you expected. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you're looking forward to a quiet weekend, forget it. Even if you're feeling fine, people in your immediate circle will be going through a period of doubt and uncertainty. Offer a shoulder to cry on and provide support for partners who have backed you in the past. 
CAPRICORN, What a moment this is! Hard work helps you overcome all restrictions. You may be feeling out of sorts, but only if you over-estimate the obstacles in your path. Actually, this is a good time to reassess your current responsibilities, perhaps with the aim of dropping some of them. AQUARIUS Domestic questions are highlighted by today's lunar alignments and seem likely to bring a burst of enthusiasm for change. Somehow work and family are linked, but the connections may not be at all clear. At least, not until next week. 
TAURUS, A sound and supportive lunar trend augurs well for success today, whatever you are doing. There's plenty of time to update plans and venture into fresh fields, making moves which will be useful later. You will run into a couple of minor obstacles, but nothing you can't handle. 
GEMINI, A word is needed about your work, worldly ambitions and professional prospects. There honestly seems to be little chance that you will succeed without a good deal of sympathy and support. Your best move is, therefore, to charm other people and persuade them of the rightness of your cause. CANCER There could be good fortune in all matters involving communication and ideas. In fact, it's a day to think laterally and to make a dramatic break from all stale habits, attitudes and opinions - and to keep friends and acquaintances on your side.

LEO, This should be a talkative sort of a time. Trivial problems could mar the start of the day, but by mid-morning you'll be back on course. Events should run heavily in your favour, all the more so if domestic expenditure is on the cards. A fresh responsibility at work could have a surprising effect on your closest relationships. 
VIRGO, This is definitely the time to promote your social image as a confident and caring person. If you're on the ball, people will look up to you as the ideal person to represent their interests. Do look after yourself, though, and make keeping fit your priority. Also Read | Why West Bengal is in crosshairs of CAB, NRC 
LIBRA, Major career changes are still pending, in spite of all the upheavals you've been through over the past year or so. Today's stars bring a prosperous but extravagant mood, and it will be necessary to watch your wallet. A financial speculation could be a fine idea, but you do need to have all options covered. 
SCORPIO, Current planetary influences seem set to boost your relationships but, what the results will be, nobody can tell. One thing is certain - that you will be swept off your feet by events over the next three or four days. Take the lead at home - your ideas may be radical, but they're certainly the best. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your ruling planet, Jupiter, has an awkward habit of dredging up all sorts of hidden desires and longings from your unconscious. There are long-term questions which can be dealt with now, mainly by talking about them. You have to have the confidence to say what you really feel. 
CAPRICORN, You may be feeling more at ease, but with the planets in their current mood, there's little time for relaxation. You will, though, be laying solid foundations for the future, especially for business expansion. Somehow, somewhere, sometime, you're going to find a new way to earn more money. AQUARIUS New career possibilities are on the horizon, but even though events are moving your way, they are unlikely to come to fruition just yet. In the long run, delays are likely to work to your advantage, yet first, you have to tackle a personal gripe. 
TAURUS, Although there's still a good deal of background tension in the air, you seem particularly well set up. Your stars are basically favourable, and there seems to be little pressure on you to do anything against your will. If you're facing family arrangements, you can put off the inevitable for another few days. Read | Lok Sabha clears Citizenship Amendment Bill 
GEMINI, Throughout every area of life, it's a question of dealing with fundamentals. Everything you do should have a beginning, a middle - and an end. Deviate from this regular, ordered pattern and you'll run the risk of coming unstuck. But stay as you are and you may miss a major opportunity! You can always leave the final choice for another few months. CANCER There are decisions to be made, but first there are discussions to be held. You should know by now that the moment you rush ahead without consulting others, conflict invariably follows. It's time you broke this pattern and gave up your tendency to over-react!

LEO, When it comes to finance, there are two rules at the moment. Where your own personal money is concerned, pay the most intense attention possible to every single detail. Where joint rearrangements are concerned, place the emphasis on getting on with people and reaching agreements. 
VIRGO, Your romantic stars are powerful, but partners may have the edge when it comes to a battle of wills. You may soon be obliged to accept an unhelpful situation as a fait accompli. At least, for now. In another couple of months, when circumstances have moved on, you'll be able to correct the situation in your favour. 
LIBRA, The accent is on pleasure over the coming days, and the best way to personal fulfilment is through devoting extra time to your creative Libran skills. Ideally, you should now be on holiday rather than at work! If you feel a little shaky, you can rely on a partner. Read | Capital worry: Pollution 
SCORPIO, Excellent prospects arise largely from the fact that you're left to pursue your own interests. There's no need to give in to the nine-to-five slog, and every chance to break out of your rut. Yet family pressures may very soon reach bursting point. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sort out your priorities and organise yourself to fit in a useful chat with a friend or someone you look up to. You may receive unsolicited advice which could help you out of a domestic impasse. Yet what is said today may be contradicted tomorrow. 
CAPRICORN, Your energy should be high at present but, if you're one of those Capricorns who is feeling under the weather, the reason lies in your unhealthy lifestyle. The solution is to cut out all those bad habits. Public pressures may be easing, but you have to tie up loose ends first. AQUARIUS If life has been a little confusing, you're entitled to blame Neptune, ruler of illusion, which has been making a subtle aspect to your sign. However, romantic undercurrents are steadily growing stronger and you should now be much more sure of your feelings. 
TAURUS, Six out of a possible ten planets are in directly supportive positions, backing your interests. That's not a bad tally! You should be able to take life at your own pace today, so anyone who tries to pressurise you could be out of luck. Make the most of any passing good fortune! READ | Karnataka bypoll results live updates 
GEMINI, Home and domestic matters are bound to take up a fair bit of your time and, even if you're at work, the best way to get on with colleagues will be to imagine you're all part of one big family. Not a perfectly happy one necessarily, but a family nonetheless! CANCER Make serious plans and take practical decisions. It has never been more important to look only at the significant details and put all your hopes, wishes and fantasies to one side. Don't be perturbed by delays. But do keep a very close watch on every detail concerning cash. 
LEO, Although you may be preoccupied with the trivia of material survival, dwelling over questions such as how to save the odd bit of cash here and there, this is in fact a somewhat optimistic and adventurous time. All that is asked of you is that you take the right decisions. READ | In Delhi Anaj Mandi fire, the only question: Is my relative alive? 
VIRGO, The Moon is well situated, strong, supportive and sympathetic. This is a welcome symbolic indication that you can have it all your own way at home, but only if you face up to hidden problems and deep undercurrents. People who think differently should soon be made to apologise for their errors! 
LIBRA, Something secret could be bothering you today. Just what this could be is far from clear, but it could be connected with regret for affairs which didn't work out. Stop being such a perfectionist and realise that you can't relive the past - at least, not now. 
SCORPIO, Social influences are looking very pronounced today, if a little serious. What you need from friends now seems to be a sense that they're going to look after you, or provide emotional security. I know this may be asking too much  but I'm sure you can cope! READ | IND vs WI: Round two goes to Williams, Windies 
SAGITTARIUS, Career and professional affairs now require their fair share of attention, all the more so if you are laying your own ideas on the line. With just a little shove in the right direction it looks as if your past efforts could be about to bring the desired rewards. 
CAPRICORN, After last week's energetic stars, this week's point to a shift of gear. You may therefore feel that you have a right to sit down and put your feet up, but any spare time is likely to be disrupted by the need to swing straight back into action. READ | Citizenship Amendment Bill in House today, Shah may announce relief for Manipur AQUARIUS You still seem to imagine nobody else understands you. The key is to listen very carefully to what your imagination is trying to tell you rather than always trying to ignore it. There's just no time to stick your head in the sand - so don't! 
TAURUS, Do try to remember that there are times when you should do what other people want, and times when you should follow your own advice. This is one of the latter, so give yourself all the space you need to do what you know is necessary. Also, business associates deserve a little more consideration in future. 
GEMINI, Others now need to appreciate that your rights must be taken into account at home. That's not a matter for negotiation. Quite aside from the fact that you demand efficiency, vastly increased comfort and much more pleasure are on the way. At work, you may like to think twice before taking on any more tricky commitments. Read | In Unnao, father of victim seeks justice ‘like Hyderabad' CANCER You're growing ever more restless. This is certain to be a time when harsh words must be spoken. Yet, such is your innate Cancerian compassion, that I am sure you will find the right tone of voice. Old friends may make better companions than recent acquaintances, by the way, and a long-overdue reunion might be a good idea. 
LEO, It's time to look at the long-term. In the months and years to come you will be thankful that you took a principled path instead of opting for blatant self-interest. Ironically, in the long run, you'll be better off because of it. If you're planning on making a quick profit, something to do with style or fashion might be a good option. 
VIRGO, The future is getting brighter every day: that's for sure. The procession of planets through mysterious realms of your solar chart means that you should no longer feel quite so threatened or all at sea emotionally. Also, you have done very well to organise your family affairs so smoothly, but don't drop your guard. Read | Internet down, NEET aspirants in Valley struggle to upload forms 
LIBRA, Very little about the future is set in stone, and the choice as to whether you do the correct thing or not, has not been decided by the planets. In other words, make your own decision in line with the facts. Also, regardless of the inconvenience, you may have to go out of your way to do what others ask at home. If money matters loom large, please do see to it that profits are spread around. 
SCORPIO, You are known as the hermit of the zodiac and are often happiest by yourself. You seem to have been bothered by people demanding all sorts of things, but you can so easily turn the tables. Never have friends and partners been so willing to perform favours and offer help. When the chips are down, you will salvage a financial situation. 
SAGITTARIUS, Powerful planetary aspects are still indicating that a shake-up of some sort is due at work. Conditions are changing and you are now set on a twelve-month course of worldly success, possibly even a triumph. When considering family arrangements, please give the priority to younger people: they will appreciate your support and repay it handsomely in times to come. 
CAPRICORN, Your lunar alignments at the beginning of the week are extraordinarily favourable, although it is up to you to make as big an effort as you can to get far-sighted ventures under way. Plus, the end result of recent business negotiations should be pretty profitable, so please don't delay and prevaricate unnecessarily. Read | Kohli's payback to Williams in Hyderabad has spiced up the series AQUARIUS There are still some surprises awaiting you, and you may soon discover that you have hidden financial talents. Even those of you whose heart has never sung at the sound of a cash register, will soon be dreaming up ways to boost your incomes. Plus, property deals will speed up, after a brief delay, much to your relief. 
TAURUS, To the left lies hard work, to the right easy gains. Ahead lies partnership, but behind you the past seems to hold happiness. Or does it? This is one of those cosmic moments when the stars challenge you to create your own future, weaving your own personal destiny. 
GEMINI, It looks as if the world is going to be full of people with cosmic hangovers bemoaning their lot. If all goes according to plan you will be responsible for spreading a little peace and light. Hopefully partners will pay attention! Take cash promises with a pinch of salt, though. CANCER There's a maximum chance for conflict today. But is this really a bad thing? How about slaying a few of those demons that have been holding you back by keeping you confused and muddled? I know I've said it before, but I'd like to say it again, anyway: life is not a rehearsal! You only have one chance, so use it. READ | Due process vs instant verdict: Applause for Telangana police and a few questions 
LEO, There was a song back in the sixties with the words 'we want the world and we want it now'. This sums up your current feelings, but it's not that simple: when you take on the world you accept all the incumbent obligations as well as the rewards. 
VIRGO, If you're rushed off your feet I've got one thing to say: good! The busier you are on all levels, the more you're in tune with your stars. You'll have plenty of opportunity to collapse in a couple of weeks' time, once you have achieved everything that's on your list. 
LIBRA, Give up your attempts to reconcile the irreconcilable. Also, watch out for accidents resulting from rash or impulsive actions, avoid aggressive authority figures, help confused family members and opt for solutions which are radical or high-tech. READ | Panipat movie review: No great shakes 
SCORPIO, You have not experienced such a pleasant set of celestial romantic alignments for at least six months. If events are moving faster than you would like, keep your nerve and you'll sow the seeds for a splendid period indeed. Look at invitations and outings that you may not have considered in the past. 
SAGITTARIUS, All is mysterious and nothing will be clear. But that's all down to distant planets such as Neptune and Uranus. Recognising that you will never truly understand the depth of current feelings you may, if you wish, throw yourself into being useful and putting yourself at the service of humanity! READ | Day after she was set ablaze, Unnao rape victim dies 
CAPRICORN, You may be the subject of an unprovoked attack, in which case I think you will do far better to turn the other cheek than respond in kind. Romantically, your current stars are pretty passionate and you might think it's a good thing to sacrifice your feelings to a loved one's. But perhaps not! AQUARIUS Whenever you're under pressure, the outcome hinges on how you react. What's really important now is the maturity of your responses. It doesn't matter what your age, experience or inclination, today is the time to be wise, reliable and authoritative. Tradition is everything.

TAURUS, Money is going to be a vital issue over the coming three or four days, even over the whole of the next week. Don't get involved in silly side-shows, and remember that you must be 100% bang on target before making your move, otherwise it will rebound on you. 
GEMINI, There's a gradual shift taking place, leading you from a temptation to exaggerate your options, to a tendency to under-estimate the possibilities. This might be a sensible move, but don't misunderstand partners' perfectly simple intentions. They may want only the best for you! CANCER Secret feelings may be pre-occupying you. In fact, it looks as if you may be happy to retreat to a private fantasy world. And why not? Day-dreaming is, in fact, a very valuable way to keep sane! What's more, some of the most useful answers to your current questions might emerge from the depths of your unconscious.

LEO, You have done well, and opportunities are around the corner. I've spoken a great deal over the last six months about this being a period of hope, expansion and good fortune. Well, developments over the next few days may test your mettle, and events over the next four weeks should show whether or not you were right. 
VIRGO, The most pressing concerns seem to be financial, even though it might only be a matter of getting on with various routine purchases. However, you must also expect conditions at home and at work to be turned completely upside down. Hopefully, it will all work out in your favour! READ | Ajit Pawar got clean chit — day after Fadnavis resigned, day before new govt was sworn in 
LIBRA, There is a lot to be said for taking firm control. I don't think you'll be able to assert any sort of authority over people who are determined to go their own way, but at least you can make sure that fundamental jobs are continued and completed, in spite of others' worst efforts. 
SCORPIO, If this is not a decisive period, I don't know what is. If you should be pushed into an emotional free-fall within the next twenty four hours, there are a number of things that you can do. For a start, you can appreciate the freedom this entails. For another, you can pick the spot where you come down to earth. 
SAGITTARIUS, You still appear to be in a quandary over a fear or worry which seems to have its roots in the past of long, long ago. You may face these hidden feelings now, or you might instead focus on improving your practical skills and experience in a way which will prove extremely useful in the future. READ | Bhuvneshwar Kumar: Getting back into swing of things 
CAPRICORN, One of my major concerns is that you're becoming a bit accident-prone, mainly because you're increasingly inclined to rash or impulsive actions. Do be cautious, and do listen to those little warning signals that other people send out, even without meaning to. AQUARIUS Chaos can be a very creative force astrologically, for it stirs new potential out of the ether. You may be bemused by the sheer range of possibilities at the present time, although you must be prepared for one set of circumstances to come to an end before another can blossom. 
TAURUS, Deep down you must know that the moment is coming when you need to resolve a personal impasse. The planetary indications are so general that we cannot distinguish between professional pressures and private. All, as the sages and wise people of the world say, is one. Horoscope Today, December 06, 2019: Aries, Cancer, Leo, Scorpio, Taurus, and other zodiac signs 
GEMINI, Anyone who tells you that you've been unfair or unjust is unlikely to be speaking the truth unless, that is, they're looking back an awful long way into the dim and distant past. Keep your intentions to yourself for a little while longer and make sure that you've got the facts straight. CANCER Discussions over serious issues should be seen for what they are - negotiations to avoid an all-out conflict. Concentrate on the facts, as far as you can, and realise the importance of give and take, recognising that others do not see the world as you do.

LEO, You should settle outstanding financial questions and prepare yourself to get on with the truly serious business, whether it be tackling an entirely new set of conditions at home, or setting out on a fresh professional adventure. People around you may still be in a difficult mood, but that doesn't mean that you should allow their feelings to affect you.

VIRGO, It does seem likely that you may be a little over-emotional. It would be a shame if you allowed your feelings to run away with you to the extent that you missed a valuable opportunity to sort out arrangements at home. Let others do their fair share at work. 
LIBRA, Privacy seems to be one of the most important considerations at the moment. You won't take kindly to anyone who pries and probes into your private affairs, or who questions your principles. Your public life is quite another matter and you need to take charge at work. 
SCORPIO, There does seem to be a fair amount of optimism in the air. I don't like to be a wet blanket, but there is, you know, a difference between liberty, which is good, and license, which is not. Be very wary if anybody tempts you to take an extreme position. 
SAGITTARIUS, Professional activities look like the most appropriate today, especially if you are prepared to take on responsibility for partners who may be flagging. Your social stars improve dramatically as the coming weeks pass, but ultimate success is down to your own willingness to see what partners really want.

CAPRICORN, Make the most of pleasant lunar alignments, and put the maximum effort into tying up any legal loose ends and travel plans. Extravagant offers may be tempting, and you may have to rely on your own advice in financial matters, especially if family members miss the point. AQUARIUS Your financial stars seem to be growing stronger. Window-shopping, or the purchasing of a few little treats, is a fine way to distract yourself from serious issues. If you are grappling with personal complications, you should recognise that other people are thoroughly well-intentioned. 
TAURUS, It's time for a few motoring metaphors: concentrate on the road ahead and keep your headlights on full beam! One area of your life which you should be able to rely on is financial, so bear in mind that you can buy your way out of the occasional spot of bother. Also Read | Letter sent to states: GST Council rings first alarm bells on revenue 
GEMINI, Don't be afraid to speak out and lay down the law, but do so with the realisation that tradition may be a more reliable guide to action than are certain modern whims and fancies. Also, continue to keep an eye on the financial situation. By the way, high-tech purchases are called for. CANCER Other people will give you a sympathetic hearing, but you may have to express yourself rather better than usual. Don't bother with the facts, if you judge them irrelevant, but do convey an impression of inspiration and enthusiasm. That's the way to persuade partners that you're right for them. 
LEO, You can only gain from generous gestures. It might be asking too much to suggest that you forgive those who have let you down but, in my opinion, this is what you must do. There is absolutely no room for bad feelings from the past, so, let go and allow the present to take its course. Also Read | Nirav-PNB rot deeper: LoUs worth Rs 25,000 crore were issued fraudulently 
VIRGO, You may try to even the score up a little, but do so by elevating your own worth rather than by putting other people down. Put more effort into rearranging home and family affairs to suit you, rather than leaving these to family members or anyone else you live with. 
LIBRA, Your solar horoscope seems to indicate that you are on the threshold of fairly major changes in your private life. Are you planning a move of home? If the answer is ‘no', then an event of similar magnitude is still likely to occur very soon, perhaps concerning your feelings about a particular person.

SCORPIO, Planetary forces are like ocean waves. If you're on the shore then you'll see them coming, but if you're currently in deep water you may not. What is due to happen now and over the weekend depends very much on how deeply you are involved in coming events. If you take a back-seat, you may miss out! 
SAGITTARIUS, I don't think there'll be any let-up from work or other routine obligations. In fact, this may be the right time for a spot of self-promotion, letting other people know how well you've done, and even advertising your readiness to take on new responsibilities. 
CAPRICORN, Foreign connections are increasingly important, but it is unclear whether it is someone from abroad who is coming into your life here and now, or if you yourself will be going overseas. Perhaps it's a two-way process, with give and take on both sides. AQUARIUS Money matters must be sorted out. It's unlikely that cash is a major cause of problems today, so it may just be a case of various small, if necessary, purchases. As far as existing decisions are concerned, take nothing for granted until the week is over. 
TAURUS, You've been under emotional pressure but it will soon be clear that you've been given a reprieve. Please be advised that all delaying tactics can only put off the inevitable for a few days, and that, in the meantime, you should continue to prepare your ground. 
GEMINI, You should pay attention to basics and remember those ancient stories about how wise people built their houses on foundations of stone, rather than sand or straw. Do the necessary deeds now and nobody will be able to blow you off course, later. Try to get more experienced friends on your side. CANCER Deal with financial questions as soon as you can. This may mean no more than a spot of essential shopping. However, before much longer you should be thinking seriously about the future: an important discussion may be overdue, and if you don't come up with the answer then you might lose control over events.

LEO, The day is divided into roughly two halves, and although you're likely to be in charge this morning, by late afternoon you may have the increasing feeling that destiny is weaving a mighty web around your affairs. You need recognition for your achievements - but it may not come just yet! 
VIRGO, Nobody can force you to reveal anything against your will. Neither can they object if you seem to be going behind their backs. By late evening, or at least by tomorrow, you'll be ready to spill the beans. Your task is to find exactly the right words. 
LIBRA, You are often to be seen at your best when engaged in your own activities, with total responsibility for how you manage your personal affairs. My concern at the moment is that you might be lured into a spot of counter-productive plotting or rumour-mongering. READ | India's new U-19 cricket captain thanks his father: He sold milk to see me play 
SCORPIO, If you feel the world is against you, today is the day to start picking up allies. Concentrate on specifics early in the day, but towards the evening focus on the broader issues. Begin to look at your long-term goals. Do they really suit you? Or should you think again? 
SAGITTARIUS, Venus is a sympathetic planet by nature, but that doesn't mean that you have it all your own way emotionally at the moment. From the astrological point of view it is only right and proper that you make more of an effort to understand partners' feelings, instead of dismissing them out of hand. 
CAPRICORN, Observe the sensible patterns which the heavens set down for you and get financial matters sewn up by mid-afternoon, especially if joint arrangements are crucial to your general well-being. Your next step should be to consider the ethical and moral implications. READ | Maharashtra scraps award of horse fair contract to Gujarat firm AQUARIUS Play your cards right and partners will be generous, loyal and forgiving. It does seem likely, though, that you may be unwilling to accept goodwill, perhaps imagining that partners have ulterior motives. You're wrong! A domestic dilemma should be solved soon. 
TAURUS, Every year has its turning point and you are now in the final sprint towards the next prime celestial signpost. To continue the metaphor, when you arrive at the parting of the ways you may not know which direction to turn. This is why this is a week to watch and wait and learn. 
GEMINI, Passions are rising, and there'll be moments when feelings can spin out of control. If in doubt, your best policy this week is to continue to smile sweetly. Actually, you may go a little further than you did last week and actively interfere in other people's lives, forcing them to look on the bright side! CANCER I can't tell you not to throw your weight around this week, for I think that it is about time that you stood up for yourself. But I can advise you to pick your targets with care. Aim right and you'll score an emotional bull's-eye. One other point: don't take too much notice of gossip! 
LEO, Every dog has its day, as the saying goes, and so it is with the signs of the zodiac. Today is your chance to play head prefect down here on planet earth, on behalf of the celestial energies up above. I think you'll have to keep the rest of us in line! 
VIRGO, Even though there are a lot of volatile feelings lingering below the surface, it's a strangely secretive day, and I would imagine you'll be keen to keep yourself to yourself. However, nothing is ever so simple, and if you do a good turn you'll be anxious for others to hear all about it! 
LIBRA, The route to success lies through team-work today, even if other people seem eager to fall out! One word of advice for the week, though: don't fret if partners prove unreliable. There may be nothing you, or they, can do about it, so do yourself a favour and remain open to new developments. 
SCORPIO, I would not be doing my job if I didn't point out that the coming astrological alignment is extremely powerful. Think back to what happened in the past and then see the current period as a fulfilment of the personal potential which was stirred up months, or even years, ago. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mixed indications suggest a number of intriguing personal possibilities. You could have good feelings at work and emotional support from partners, but possible friction over finances. Indeed, I'd keep a very close watch on cash transactions this week if I were you: you don't want to throw good money after bad. 
CAPRICORN, Somebody is positioning themselves for a major row. If you wish to have a jolly good knock-about, probably towards the end of the week, all well and good. If, on the other hand, you want a quiet life, use evasive action now. Whatever happens, take responsibility for your own achievements! AQUARIUS For once you seem to be strangely resistant to change. In fact, it looks as if you'll be hanging on tight this week in the face not of a wind of change, but a full-scale hurricane. By the end of the week, though, you may have to alter your strategy. And that might just be a good thing! 
TAURUS, Partners' real achievements and success are bound to give you pleasure as the year begins, although whether you will be so pleased with your own progress is another matter. In many respects this is a deeply significant time for you, but the position is not yet clear. 
GEMINI, There's no particular reason why you shouldn't take outrageous decisions, but you should understand that as long as your planetary ruler, Mercury, is so intriguingly placed at the beginning of the year, you may not express yourself as well as you might. CANCER Unexpected and surprising happenings may have had your mind working along unfamiliar lines, but your current planetary picture goes some way towards restoring a greater sense of balance. Test your ideas out on other people over the coming weeks before putting them into practice. 
LEO, You'll be brimming over with sensible ideas for improving your domestic situation this week, although, in some strange way, anything that happens is strangely linked to professional affairs. Remember, you are responsible for guaranteeing your material security as you enter your next twelve-month cycle. 
VIRGO, When, in the distant past, challenging celestial configurations prompted you to take stock of your financial situation, they helped lay the foundations for what must - and will - be a fairly confident period. Yet people who have your interests at heart may continue to question your priorities. 
LIBRA, This is one of those unusual periods when the planets seem prepared to allow you to get on with your life unmolested by dramatic interruptions or lack of sympathy from other people. This week, it's certainly very pleasant to be reminded that you're in control, but also that your emotional state is improving. 
SCORPIO, It's an excellent moment if you're willing to team up with partners in an honest and equal relationship. But, if you settle for confrontation, you must be prepared to come off badly and recreate a past you thought had gone forever. It will soon be time to get on with the next stage of your most personal plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, Serious Saturn, the great planet of authority and experience, is sending you solid support over the coming week. You will have time to establish new initiatives and relationships very soon but, in the meantime, you will be given a second shot at something you failed to accomplish last year. That alone makes all recent delays worth the wait. 
CAPRICORN, All those personal arrangements which seemed unlikely a short while ago will come to seem more desirable as time passes. Recent decisions may have been highly complicated yet, rest assured, you'll have a chance to change your mind soon, perhaps helped by a new friend or colleague as last week gives way to this. AQUARIUS Friendly arrangements will bring practical gains assuming, of course, that they are made on a business-like basis over the week. Plus, committee work or involvement in a group fighting for a common cause, will become a more attractive proposition. Familiarise yourself with changing circumstances and you will know what you must do next. 
TAURUS, Events that come to light in an unusual manner may remind you that human beings are complex indeed. It is no use imagining that everyone does things just because they have nothing better to do! Sometimes they actually want to help you! 
GEMINI, There will be a number of occasions when you must bite your lip if you are to keep everyone on your side - and avoid giving any offence. But, then, you are perfectly within your rights to decide that now is the time to say what you think. If so, then prepare your words with care. CANCER For some time you have been feeling that the world is against you. I hope you now see that things are improving. In spite of certain difficulties, Venus brings home the essential truth that you'll feel better if you smile: others will smile with you. 
LEO, You may well be wondering why so little mention has been made of home and family life this week. The reason is that it is only now that the planetary indicators are insisting on absolute and total change. It's all to do with the Sun and Moon, but that's another story! 
VIRGO, Everywhere you look, foreign countries, strange cultures or people from far away, seem to be playing the crucial role. You must recognise that all thoughts, proposals and decisions will be made on the basis of raw emotion. Reason doesn't come into it! 
LIBRA, Beneficial changes are finally afoot, and you should realise that family members and spouses are not so bad after all. A financial situation, though, is still precarious and requires delicate handling for some time yet, especially if you are to reach an amicable solution. 
SCORPIO, A lot of people misunderstand you, something you're probably used to. Yet I don't think this is inevitable. Rather than trying to explain yourself, why don't you just try to fit in and show willing as far as someone else's pet project is concerned. 
SAGITTARIUS, Take care that you don't become so engrossed in other people's wrangles that you forget certain essential tasks, one of which is to make sure that you are in the peak of health. Clean up your diet, for a start, if you haven't already done so. And then make sure you're taking the right sort of exercise. 
CAPRICORN, Now's your chance to prove how charming you are. This is a period rich with opportunities for self-indulgence and pleasure, so hold yourself back at your peril. The company of children and younger relatives should be fun, and a cultural outing will be stimulating. AQUARIUS It's true to say that you've suffered enough. Yet there is much that you can do to help yourself, and all the indications now are that you should make a break with the negative emotional patterns of the past and restore close contact with a family member. 
TAURUS, Today's main planetary aspect is undoubtedly emotional and volatile, but it will be quite easy to defuse other people's hysteria by calmly and sympathetically explaining the facts as you see them. You may also have to make up someone's mind for them. 
GEMINI, The full impact of current celestial alignments is bound to be difficult to understand. You may have one of those strange feelings that all is not quite right. That aside, if you want to do something for yourself, sort out chronic health irritations. Cancer Passions are running high. You may prefer the company of friends with whom you have little emotional connection, but if you go in for intimate one-to-one encounters, then you must be prepared for long-buried feelings to erupt from the unconscious depths.

LEO, You are in a very strong position, and not for the first time, but that may not shield you from a few items of flying emotional shrapnel. The possibility of tearful scenes increases as the hours pass, but so does your ability to make the peace and turn chaos into order. 
VIRGO, You may well receive some sort of a revelation today. You might hear a welcome item of news, and the feeling that you finally know what is going on will make it all worthwhile. You can expect a display of emotion at work, perhaps late in the day. 
LIBRA, Also read | Maharashtra: Secularism, immediate farm loan waiver in joint document Sometimes you need to know when not to get involved, so let sleeping dogs lie unless you want to land yourself with a rather large bill at some time in the next week. What comes to light in an unusual way will suggest that other people are better at handling money than you. 
SCORPIO, The first step in the right direction now appears to be to recognise that someone else was absolutely right all along. However, while that might be the case as far as actions and behaviour are concerned, your beliefs and imagination are still spot-on. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should feel positive but, if you let your suspicions run riot, you may end up feeling rather gloomy. However, there is no need to be gloomy. Press ahead with daily matters; you may gain an immense amount of satisfaction from concentrating on immediate and routine necessities. 
CAPRICORN, Friends you hardly know, casual acquaintances in other words, are likely to give you a hard time. Why they feel they have the right to do this is a complete mystery. You're far better off mixing with lovers, children and people who are young at heart — and who you know you can trust. AQUARIUS You are usually very alert. If your sixth sense is functioning to the full, you may discover that an employer or another authority figure is behaving irrationally. You may decide to keep out of the way, and that might be the best thing you can do. 
TAURUS, You may now begin to wonder if you have overlooked one or two facts. I think you have, so don't commit yourself to a new decision or opinion until next week. One thing you can be sure of is your dreams; and when all else fails you still have a vision of a better world. 
GEMINI, Mars is very firm in its insistence that a partner or business associate must settle a debt of honour. It is not your fault that other people have lost money, or been ripped-off or short-changed. If you can do one thing this week then it's to get others to recognise that things can only get better! Also Read | In 2017, DEA Secy wrote: Why were electoral bond details shared with RBI? CANCER I know that you have put on a brave face, but if the past few weeks have taught you anything it is that in future you must be more honest and speak from your heart. If other people behave badly, then they must be told. Whether they take any notice is another matter! 
LEO, A good general, they say, never goes into battle unless victory is assured. In some respects, the odds are stacked against you. This is probably quite a good thing, for if you are stopped in your tracks you will be forced to think again and smarten up your act.

VIRGO, You're now in a relatively prosperous period, one when you should check up on all joint commitments. Hopefully you've taken all the right advice and have turned a potential loss into a healthy profit. Also, do bear in mind that there may be a conflict of interest between your desires and a partner's needs. 
LIBRA, You can't always look at life seriously, so take some of today's developments with a pinch of salt, for not everything is as it seems. You may soon discover that developments in your public affairs will go a long way towards increasing the quality of your life. 
SCORPIO, It's true that other people are full of themselves, but partners are barking up the wrong tree if they imagine they can out-smart or out-manoeuvre you. Even if you pretend to agree with them, you will nevertheless maintain your own attitudes and opinions. 
SAGITTARIUS, Hopefully you will now begin to realise that partners, colleagues and close companions are entitled to have a say in joint financial arrangements. If you are thinking of teaming up with someone in a potentially profitable venture, then the best choice may be a female relation.

CAPRICORN, You must try to avoid any further disruption. The emphasis should swing very much towards co-operation and compromise, even if you do feel that someone is getting away scot-free. In any event, an individual who has wronged you may shortly make amends. AQUARIUS Your sole aim and priority must be to arrange your monetary affairs in such a manner that you benefit other people as well as yourself. There are two possibilities around the middle of the day: either you'll voluntarily give something away or you'll lose it. In other words, are you going to jump, or will you wait to be pushed? 
TAURUS, Keep remembering that it's important to do things in line with what is right, ethically and morally, and you won't go far wrong. It's not that the stars punish self-interest, only that what's right for you, at the moment, is the same as what's right for everyone. Read | After dark night, Constitution Day in Maharashtra 
GEMINI, The Moon has moved on since yesterday, reflecting alterations in your mood and disposition. At the same time as you have to complete outstanding practical tasks, today is the moment to contemplate the bigger picture, reminding yourself that you don't live by bread alone. Cancer Mars is still sufficiently intimately aligned with sensitive sectors in your chart to suggest that you can stamp your foot, bang the table and insist on getting your own way. However, you're now exactly on the boundary between a demanding phase and a giving one. Also read | Visibility can be a problem with Pink ball during second/ third session, says Cheteshwar Pujara 
LEO, At least you are beginning to focus on the real, underlying facts. Having argued or procrast-inated over professional or other ambitious matters for some months, you are soon to be able to wrap up an important decision, but not, I must add, before next week. 
VIRGO, Life is not always straightforward, and there's no point in expecting it to be. If you are now torn between past associations and future involvements, you are not alone. The confusing impressions emanate from Pisces, a sign which is always moving in two directions at once, so be patient. 
LIBRA, Partners or close companions are at last doing the right thing, and about time too. Someone is finally prepared to listen to you, which must be a considerable relief. But they must also be allowed to say their piece. Hopefully the air will be cleared before long. 
SCORPIO, Your best course of action is not clear, so you should be prepared to let another person take the initiative. Follow their lead and watch carefully for the indications that it is now time for you to take over. They'll appreciate your trust and support. 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything now signifies that social and romantic arrangements should be finalised. Domestic affairs may be confusing, if pleasant, while the greatest inspiration could come from close contacts with family members. In fact, words of wisdom might arrive from the most unexpected people. 
CAPRICORN, There are so many adverse alignments connected with planets like Mars and Saturn that it is surprising when both these planets encourage you to make practical improvements. You may feel that you have had the rough end of the bargain, but someone is soon going to pay you the apology you deserve. AQUARIUS All your instincts and hunches are urging you to hang on in there and not let go. This is probably very wise, but sooner or later something at home is going to have to be talked about and discussed. Prepare your story now, and make sure it fits the facts. 
TAURUS, Adverse planetary activity has certainly knocked you off balance, but it doesn't usually take you long to regain your equilibrium. It seems all too easy, at the moment, to blame other people, but that might not be the best way of going about things. 
GEMINI, Money is bound to be an increasingly powerful factor, and why not? After all, nobody gets very far without it. Put the maximum effort into increasing your earnings, but do so in the knowledge that, first of all, only hard work will produce the desired results and, secondly, you should not wish for more than you deserve. CANCER Most of the conflicts and uncertainty in your solar chart at the moment arise from other people's lack of commitment, or so it seems. Are you sure you don't have a personal vested interest in seeing that someone backs off? Perhaps you just need some more time for yourself. 
LEO, I know I have given you this advice before, but it must be repeated: wait until you are absolutely ready if you have a major change or upheaval to undertake, and don't allow others to make your decisions for you. You may, of course, continue to set up all the necessary preparations for your next step. Explained: What now in Maharashtra? 
VIRGO, The stars are still urging you on, so don't wait for others to give the green light before pressing ahead. You now have all the ammunition and information you require to make a decisive move, and all you need now is the assurance that you'll have the support you've asked for. 
LIBRA, There are a number of thought-provoking aspects in your chart at the moment. One of the most obvious indicates that someone who has been unpunctual, indecisive and utterly unreliable, may now be mending their ways. Is that too much to hope for? I don't think so! 
SCORPIO, The Sun, the brightest planet and the soul of the solar system, is approaching a decisive relationship with a series of dim and distant parts of the sky. This is the simple reason why an emotional tie or attachment now appears to be going through a confusing phase. Also Read | Another pink Test: Players still unconvinced 
SAGITTARIUS, Personally, and emotionally, you are now coming to the end of one brief phase and are about to enter another which might be much more refreshing. One result is that you'll become increasingly concerned about the cost of a particular relationship. 
CAPRICORN, Sometimes you need to come first but why not try to put yourself in someone else's shoes and understand why they've been throwing their weight around. It may be that they have been upset and frightened, in which case they need your sympathy and support. AQUARIUS The Moon rises in an intriguing position, an indication that it could be time for an early start. It also, by the way, suggests that you may make an early finish, so don't work late unless there is no alternative. Make time for activities which mean most to you, not for what other people think you should be doing. 
TAURUS, People born under your sign are more obstinate than most, although in a way which is utterly endearing, delightfully modest and totally disarming. The simple message for the whole of this week is: remember that you are number one. On the other hand, being top does bring its responsibilities. 
GEMINI, You have learnt how to put up with people you'd rather ignore, but just as you're feeling happy with the situation, the planets insist on further changes. Now you must gear yourself up for a period during which you will learn how to be alone - or at least not so dependent on others! Read | Punjab: 16-yr-old tied to a pillar, burnt alive in Mansa CANCER Hopefully you listen to the stars, but do you take their advice? It's a matter of tuning in to your intuitions, never an easy thing. The point is that if your high standards slipped last week, you will have to make amends by next week. Right now you're in a transitional period. 
LEO, Although you have some serious problems of a business or joint financial nature to contend with, I maintain that in the long run the outcome will be favourable. In fact, today you have a chance to sort everything out once and for all, or at least until next month! 
VIRGO, It is said that you are hard-working, loyal and efficient. Well, today is the day to prove the astrologers right, for it seems that you will be entering the fray to clear up the chaos left behind by more careless people. You may have little time left over after the daily graft. 
LIBRA, You should now know how the next stage of major alterations in your personal life are to occur. I don't think you'll be able to put it into words, but I am convinced that on an intuitive level you understand exactly what is going on and what must be done. Read | Maharashtra: With Operation Lotus, BJP prepares for floor test 
SCORPIO, One thing that always impresses me is that you have the honesty and courage to admit when you are wrong, even if only to yourself. That's important, because today offers an ideal moment for family and domestic reconciliation. And about time too, some people might say. 
SAGITTARIUS, Accept what is offered and be thankful that the world is basically on your side. The current helpful planetary alignments indicate that, if you take more than your fair share, you won't have it for long, so be generous and do the right thing now. 
CAPRICORN, The right interpretation of planetary energies over the next few weeks indicates that you had better become a little less belligerent, a little more eager to please. However, you still have another three or four days during which you can put your foot down - and get away with it. AQUARIUS This is not the moment to break the rules or habits of a lifetime. You can, however, consider whether you will do it all better next time round. You must realise that you now have a chance to end a very negative cycle of events - as long as you listen to people who have more experience. 
TAURUS, You may now feel that you must become even more committed to a person or a project if the tidal wave of change is to rush on. Yet, during the course of the month, you will also come under mounting pressure to say farewell to one particular emotional commitment. 
GEMINI, You do not have to accept what is currently on offer; for it is clear that developments in the family are under your control. You may therefore act decisively to influence the course of events, not just out of self-interest, but for everyone's good. CANCER Jupiter, the great planet of good fortune, is exerting a peculiarly lively impact on your personal affairs. By the end of the month some of you will already be feeling the pleasant stirrings of rewards for past efforts, others will be experiencing a sense of hope as old doubts are dispelled. 
LEO, Yours is a sign which habitually deals in grand gestures, but the major planetary aspects at present are not those which naturally reinforce your sunny nature. It is work, responsibility and routine which figure large. This is a period when you must put down emotional and practical foundations with great care and patience. 
VIRGO, Mercury, Venus and Mars, the so-called personal planets, all come to your support, suggesting that this is the moment for you to take personal charge of a number of areas in which you have allowed your control to slip. It seems likely now that vague fears will be cleared up. 
LIBRA, Nobody knows better than you that there is no easy way to deal with life's varied problems. Yet now that the Sun is so tough and the Moon so gentle, you must see that events are moving your way. Indeed, what once seemed to be an insurmountable problem may now appear to be a source of encouragement. 
SCORPIO, Take the full possible advantage of some reassuring aspects from Mercury, Venus and Mars, three planets which are calculated to boost your personal image. It is time to temper your secretive tendencies, permitting partners and colleagues access to the information they require. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Sun is now exerting a decisive impact on the part of your chart related to long-distance travel and overseas connections. Very convenient too, you might think, in view of the fact that you're ready to expand your horizons. Yet what is really being released is your thirst for romantic adventure. 
CAPRICORN, You are now in a strong position to air any grievances or deeply-held opinions, encouraged by generous Jupiter's challenge to your sign. However, do not mistake other people's well-meaning efforts to help you as an attempt to dominate your life. AQUARIUS The reason why business partners and friends have been so off-hand lately should now be clear, and you may see that no ill-will was intended. Indeed, you must let go of all old and stale feelings, realising that bitterness and resentment are alien to the true Aquarian spirit. 
TAURUS, Tomorrow's challenging lunar pattern is already casting its shadow over your affairs, though in the nicest possible way. This will be an optimum weekend for creative expression, cultural events, romantic encounters and happy relationships with children. 
GEMINI, Tense planetary aspects will force you to prove just how well-informed, alert and astute you really are. I have every faith that you will rise to the challenge, demonstrating to everyone that they were absolutely right to place their trust and confidence in you. CANCER You can use your time in no better way than by getting your future plans and arrangements perfectly straight. That may mean seeking expert advice and sitting down and drawing up lists. At the same time, though, this is an emotional phase, and your heart-strings will be tugged. READ | Uddhav Thackeray: Behind mild exterior, a tough negotiator, tech-savvy manager 
LEO, All in all, it's a positive period - one when a practical frame of mind helps you through every little problem. At the heart of all financial worries lies a fear of going without. However, if you get to grips with such unconscious fears, you'll manage your money much more efficiently. 
VIRGO, The coming planetary pattern is already indicating a critical turning-point in your affairs. Might I suggest that you fall in with the mood of the times and implement certain much-needed long-term reforms and improvements? Family members will look up to you when you set a more positive example. 
LIBRA, Learn to let go and allow others the freedom they seek. The surprising fact is that, if other people are granted their independence, they may choose not to use it. Why don't you trust your instincts for a change, and play around with new solutions to old problems? READ | IND vs BAN: Around Eden Gardens, a splash of bonhomie, nostalgia and lunch at 3 pm 
SCORPIO, It's a sociable day. However, it's difficult to know whether social outings will offer an escape from personal complications, or whether intimate encounters will save you from group activities. The best advice is to play it by ear, and not to make your move until you're certain. 
SAGITTARIUS, One minor cycle in your life comes to an end this weekend. Both work and family questions will arrive at a satisfactory point and you may use current conditions as a launch pad for future achievements. And remember this - all endings open the way for new beginnings. 
CAPRICORN, Today's planetary picture brings good news for Capricorns, just as long as you refuse to rise to the provocation that is always likely at such times. And any foreign contacts, legal questions and educational aspirations will all benefit from a renewed sense of purpose. AQUARIUS Your financial affairs will reach a turning-point and may never be the same again. If you have any sense, you will consciously steer your situation towards conditions which will guarantee your future prosperity. And, if you do that, then people close to you will also share the benefits. READ | Theatre and film actor Shaukat Kaifi passes away 
TAURUS, Although current planetary aspects are rather exciting, you are probably past your period of peak activity. Briefly, you'll return to a more measured and sedate lifestyle, which could come as something of a relief. The real reason is that you've changed. Quite simply, you're more in control. 
GEMINI, Family relationships are possibly the most important part of your life, and now that you are in the final approach to a set of extremely helpful planetary alignments, you must see to it that you are happy with the general situation. The details you can sort out when the time is right. CANCER At the best of times, you tend to get carried away by your emotions, yet this only works when you are surrounded by people who love you. If you have skeptical colleagues to convince, please be more rational. They'll listen carefully if you stick to the facts. 
LEO, You are naturally broad-minded, but you do have an obstinacy which is sometimes unrivaled by any other sign of the Zodiac. My advice to you now is to take other people into your confidence and make compassion, rather than self-interest, your guiding principle. 
VIRGO, Partners and business associates appear to be at their most belligerent. They may use every trick in the book to get you to commit yourself to spending or saving policy that frankly doesn't suit your needs. But there may still be some sense in what they say. 
LIBRA, Most of the storm clouds should now have dispersed, allowing you to deal effectively with personal and financial matters. However, certain vague fears and worries are likely to persist until next week. Realize that these may be groundless - and get whatever support and reassurance you need. 
SCORPIO, For all your preoccupation with rights and principles, you seem to be strangely reluctant to allow other people the same degree of freedom that you demand for yourself. In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that they should complain. They'll be happy to know that you're listening. 
SAGITTARIUS, Everyone around you seems to have some complaint or other, and you may feel weighed down by others' moans and groans. Unfortunately, it is part of the Sagittarian's burden to have to cheer up such miserable and pessimistic people. Put a brave face on it! 
CAPRICORN, If your work doesn't give you the boost you crave, you must find a new personal outlet. Venus, the planet of prosperity is still creating additional prospects for financial gain, especially through joint investments. But remember, the most important consideration is emotional riches, not financial. AQUARIUS The time has come to make monetary reward the main priority at work. There is no reason why you should be so idealistic as to give up the chance of the pleasure and prosperity that are yours by right. After all, you can't survive on the goodwill and you can't eat kind words. 
TAURUS, Well, it's time to do a little thinking about your long-term hopes and wishes, who you are, where you're going and all that sort of thing. Try talking to people and see what responses you get. You may find that by using a partner as a sounding-board you receive advice that you never thought possible. 
GEMINI, There may be a clash of priorities as family members and home interests compete for attention with professional ambitions. It may be a partner who is the unwitting cause of a current dilemma. If so, give them all the space and support they need to sort it out. CANCER The Sun has now been joined by Mercury in an adventurous position, a pretty good sign that many of you are likely to be travelling far afield over the next month. All adventurous Cancerians will be in their element, expanding their horizons and extending their boundaries. READ | Inside IFFI 2019: Rajinikanth, Amitabh Bachchan and others in attendance 
LEO, In the past you have changed your ideas rather too often. Now, however, you must make up your mind, forget the past and concentrate on turning current situations to your own good fortune. At home, by the way, you could benefit from a family gathering. 
VIRGO, If you have managed to extract watertight guarantees or assurances, then you have nothing to fear. It is important that you build up a support network of friends and relatives who you know will back you to the hilt, whatever happens and through thick and thin. 
LIBRA, The Sun and Mercury are both stressing your working affairs in a rather favourable manner. It is time to turn your attention to personal matters, seeing to it that harmonious relationships form the basis of a satisfactory public and professional life. The two are closely linked - as you know. READ | Finally, ISRO makes it official: Vikram made a hard-landing 
SCORPIO, A long-standing relationship or involvement still appears to be going through an intense phase. What transpired at work today may arouse your emotions, especially if colleagues seem determined to become dependent on you. Still, perhaps it is time you took a little more responsibility. 
SAGITTARIUS, The current Sun-Moon pattern suggests that a move or major upheaval will be to your advantage. Public and professional issues may be dominated by purely personal and private feelings. What that means is that you have to figure out your own motivations before you can do anything else. 
CAPRICORN, The overall lunar picture signifies that the tide of fortune is all ready to turn in your favour. Indeed, imminent developments can only lead to further satisfaction and a sense of deepening personal fulfilment. As long as you feel richer inside, it will all be worth it. AQUARIUS Your powerful sense of right and wrong is your best ally at the moment. Remember all those wonderful sayings about turning the other cheek and how you should forgive your enemies seven times seven. That's the best advice right now. A friendly hint from a colleague could also point you in a positive direction at work. READ | Pakistan's latest pace sensation, 16-year-old Naseem Shah, has impressed even the great Andy Roberts 
TAURUS, That merry planet Mercury is trucking along through a sociable sector of your chart. This is about the most friendly influence you could hope to have. In cordial company you will be on top form and everyone will appreciate your gentle wit. You could even persuade someone to do the impossible! 
GEMINI, Financial affairs intrude on your consciousness this morning. It's a fine time to settle outstanding bills and make additional purchases. It's also a day which favours short trips, meetings and discussions, not to mention friendly gatherings with friends. CANCER Trying to understand yourself more clearly or make yourself more efficient are both worthwhile goals. You should have realised by now that it is no longer good enough to muddle along in the hope that something will turn up. You actually have to make it happen! 
LEO, You are not making things any easier for yourself by digging in your heels or refusing to discuss long-term plans with colleagues and associates. Wouldn't you do better to use a little gentle persuasion? Well, yes, but you had better check up on the facts first. Also Read | Stone-pelting in J&amp;K down since Aug 5, says govt, data differs 
VIRGO, It wouldn't take much for you to let yourself off the hook. All you have to do is realise that other people, not you, must bear much of the criticism for current cock-ups and fiascos. In love, you'll be generous to a fault, but others may not respond as you'd like. 
LIBRA, The current lunar positions are bound to exert a disruptive and upsetting influence. The reason I am saying this now is so that you may prepare the ground by shaping events to your will and interests. Your first duty, though, is to find out what partners want. 
SCORPIO, You can teach other people a thing or two about infatuation or obsession. Now that the Sun, the Moon, Uranus and Pluto are so powerfully aligned you are liable to become fixated by a particular person or idea. You are able, though, to get your way through sheer seductive charm. 
SAGITTARIUS, Keep travel plans under scrutiny. You may not need to worry about delays or hold-ups this week, yet, if you do not make your intentions and arrangements crystal clear, other people may set off in an entirely different direction. Once again, the secret of success lies in the tiny details. Also Read | JNU protests: Police officers asked me: Andhe ho toh protest mein aaye kyun? 
CAPRICORN, It is very important that you use your Capricornian skills to establish your family and domestic affairs on a firm footing. Personal discussions should be free-ranging and include various associated emotional issues. In short, everything is up for grabs. AQUARIUS The Sun, together with Mercury, is pushing your financial affairs in positive directions. You'll do well to follow your intuition and even act on the basis of the odd significant day-dream or two; it could be a dream which shows you the way forward better than the facts.

TAURUS, The Sun is still maintaining your social profile, reminding you that it is important to get other people to see that your way of doing things is best. With charm like yours, how can you fail? Only by not taking care of every single detail, that's how. 
GEMINI, The first thing to say is that there is a shortage of epoch-making planetary aspects at the moment. The result is that you may begin to see yourself as more in control of your life than you have been for quite some time. If you do, that's a sign that you may come unstuck very soon. Also Read | Deal in works: Uddhav Maharashtra CM for 5 yrs, deputies from Congress, NCP CANCER There's one thing you want more than anything else in your life, and recently it has seemed that you have been about to achieve it. However, if you have fallen at the last hurdle, can you wait for another two months? Current developments may open your eyes to the broader picture. 
LEO, Don't back away from problems at work. People in all areas of your life are waiting for you to make yourself clear and demonstrate that you are able to cope with any amount of practical difficulty. People you live with could get intense, so don't let anything surprise you. 
VIRGO, You seem to be quite preoccupied with personnel changes on the work front. Seeing as that radical sign Aquarius is involved, you may be concerned to increase your independence and sense of personal responsibility.

LIBRA, A series of powerful planetary aspects has been keeping your personal affairs in a state of flux. However, Venus, planet of love is bringing help from near at hand. And that help may be more practical than you think. In the meantime, sort out cash questions while you can. 
SCORPIO, If you are absolutely determined to assert your authority, there seems to be little to stand in your way. The Moon combines with the Sun to strengthen an already solid personal position - much to your relief! The best advice is to take a creative approach, but keep other people on your side. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Sun and Mercury are casting their benevolent rays over your family affairs. You are never certain about your foundations, emotional and otherwise, yet really you have little to worry about. Probably the best area to focus on is the effect your public commitments have on your private affairs. Also Read | ‘Studied Sanskrit all my life, never made to feel I am Muslim, but now…' 
CAPRICORN, Have you realised that the obstacle you faced last week was a hurdle to leap over, not a brick wall to stop your progress? By now you must be well on your way to establishing your life on an entirely fresh footing. Today's Venusian alignments should help balance your emotions. AQUARIUS This may well be a challenging and upsetting time, but graceful Venus will bring support and sympathy from close friends. The best thing you can be told is that your fears and worries are illusory. And the best thing you can do is wait until you have a clearer picture. 
TAURUS, You may have a conservative reputation but, if allowed to express yourself, you have a wonderfully understated eccentric way of working. Now that Venus is aligned with a publicity-minded region of your chart, partners and associates will begin to notice your fascinating qualities. 
GEMINI, The Moon makes a number of very sharp moves today, which means that domestic affairs should now be sorted out and family relationships resolved, at least until the end of the week. Older relations could be the most helpful — you know who you can rely on. Read | Key sales numbers show rural demand may dip further CANCER Everything that has happened recently has conspired to change the rules of the game. Don't blame other people though, after all it's you who has moved the goal posts, possibly for the very good reason that it seemed the right thing to do at the time. 
LEO, The Moon eases its way through a private sector of your chart, inspiring dreams, strange imaginings and mysteries of the most colourful kind. You will relish any intrigues or uncertainty that cloud your vision today. After all, a mystery could be the cause of much more pleasure. 
VIRGO, Nobody can really put you on the spot or undermine your confidence. You are so full of self-doubt that you are skilled at sabotaging your own interests. Make it your goal to boost your self-esteem and inspire respect. But don't feel that you need to rush into anything hasty.

LIBRA, Your personal affairs will be highlighted in a rather special and even spectacular way this week. Yet another full seven days may pass before you can genuinely get to grips with outstanding domestic differences and family hopes. That gives you every reason to wait until your mind is made up. 
SCORPIO, Pluto is a volatile planet, though often a force for good. This week you can be fully confident that this wonderful planet's healing and restorative powers will be used utterly in your favour - even if at first it looks as if the opposite is true. Things are not always what they seem! 
SAGITTARIUS, Because Jupiter, your planetary ruler, is still so powerful, you have all the protection you need. However, I would not say that this is a time for taking risks. On the contrary, great prudence is required. You see, if you're to be a proper gambler you have to know the outcome before you start. 
CAPRICORN, Even though you may be convinced that some kind of major career or professional change is unavoidable, you may hold things up for a while if you wish. However, it is certain that you can trust partners' generosity. Think now about what you might offer in return. AQUARIUS Even the most dedicated Aquarians shouldn't keep their noses pressed to the grindstone all week. After all, you need a rest and a chance to get on with your own intensely personal interests. A word of advice - treat all amazing financial offers with a huge pinch of salt. 
TAURUS, In spite of what close companions may believe, you must realise that business considerations are highly relevant to your romantic life. The confidence bred by success will encourage you to expect more of other people socially, no longer settling for second best. 
GEMINI, You must make a choice affecting a person who touches you on your deepest emotional levels. You know now that an unsatisfactory situation can carry on no longer and that it is up to you to call a halt. You also know in your heart that once you have made a decision the storm clouds will disappear. Read | Ganga pollution: Govt plans 5-year jail, Rs 50 crore fine CANCER A powerful consortium of planets is urging you to play it safe and tuck yourself away in your shell for a while. What this means is that you must choose very carefully how and when you act, particularly if other people are involved. Remember that the whole world is bound to move your way. 
LEO, The source of any trouble will be people who don't know you very well. Quite why they should make such unjustified assumptions about your plans and intentions is not clear, but may be due to your typical Leonine refusal to explain yourself. 
VIRGO, You have been faced with a number of important decisions, as is right and proper for any wise and thoughtful person, which have brought in their train a degree of self-criticism and self-doubt. Now, though, is the time for a determined boost in your confidence. Read | Waiting in the wings: Sena's new Maha power balance 
LIBRA, Those who have planned holidays or time off are well placed. Those who have not, will be champing at the bit, eager for a spot of adventure. On a more down-to-earth note, you should seize this opportunity to resolve any questions with legal overtones. And don't bend the rules. 
SCORPIO, As the days pass you will begin to feel much happier about the state of play in your associations with both friends and lovers. Venus' passionate relationship with Pluto brings matters to a head one way or the other, and you will decide to stick with your current situation. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you learn how to handle opposition from partners and rivalry from colleagues, you will gain in experience to the point where you'll be in an ideal position to handle the next phase of growth. In the meantime, all you can really do is offer suggestions, provide advice and assistance and generally play second fiddle.

CAPRICORN, You will be called to account for your financial goals. It is not possible to say for sure whether the outcome will be favourable or not, although I would guess that it will be. What is certain is that there will be a flurry of activity which will drive other, more personal concerns underground for a while. AQUARIUS Mercury, god of communication will give you the wit and speed of mind to overcome any difficulties following on from the influence of belligerent Mars in your house of relationships. If partners give in to the demands of unreason and anger, you can do no worse than present them with the facts. 
TAURUS, Today is the day that Mercury, which signifies your deepest thoughts and imaginings, adopts a new set of alignments. This is an astrological way of saying that, before you turn a corner, you would do well to pause for a moment and take stock - and also take an extra look at the details. 
GEMINI, You have been more prone than most people to vague suspicions and strange imaginings. However, I believe that from now on all mysteries will be cleared up and most of your questions answered. You should be relieved that a partner'ss opposition has now subsided. CANCER Stick up for yourself! You ought to be ringing the changes with increasing confidence and determination. Everything you do at the moment, however personal or trivial, will stand you in good stead when the planetary whirlwind picks up speed again in a few weeks.

LEO, Shopping sprees are on the agenda thanks to the Moon'ss relationship with Mars. You don't have to take partner's assertions as the absolute truth - make a few waves and insist your ideas are taken into account. You might also find yourself footing the bill for a social outing. 
VIRGO, Much the same advice applies today as yesterday - relax and indulge yourself. There'ss plenty of scope for fun, so please don't succumb to the general mood of selfishness or make unnecessary emotional demands on partners. If you're tempted to argue over a principle then stop and think: you might just be wrong. READ | Ajinkya Rahane, India's safety net back on firm ground 
LIBRA, Your traditional ways of doing things have proved remarkably effective. If there'ss a Libran motto, it must be 'first among equals. You are cleverly able to give the illusion that everyone'ss interests are being respected while in fact you're getting your own way. Clever old you! 
SCORPIO, You seem to have a much better idea of the reasons for recent upsets than other people. The Moon is defending your interests, teaching you that it is all right to be a sensitive Scorpio. For once, the world should be marching in step with you, and you should be the one who calls the tune. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon, planet of emotion, is linking up with Mars, ruler of active change. Even long-established ties or associations have to alter in some way, and you must realise that there is simply no point in endeavouring to turn the clock back. You have to face the future. READ | Motichoor Chaknachoor movie review: Astonishingly regressive  
CAPRICORN, At a time when some people still seem determined to argue, you can either enter the fray or remain aloof. Either way, try to prove by your statements and actions just how spiritually advanced and mature you are. Travel stars look just fine. Trips to sentimental places will please. AQUARIUS There is no earthly reason why you should be the one to fork out when other people are short of cash. Still, seeing as this is an extravagant moment, you may as well spend money where it'ss needed. If you're entertaining friends, then your plans may require brief trips or extra phone calls. 
TAURUS, The Moon is a friendly planet for Taureans, prompting, as it does, the sort of delicate and lazy mood which you find so comfortable and reassuring. Aside from over-sensitivity there is little to disturb your equilibrium. By the way, if someone tries to convince you that they're absolutely right, remember that you've only got their word for it. 
GEMINI, Someone still does not understand that you have ambitions which must be achieved, or at least appeased. Neither do they fully realise the depths of your financial insecurity, nor your dreams of future prosperity. Be patient and give them time to come round. CANCER Today's lunar alignments are supportive and energising, and should enable you to keep up to schedule and achieve most of your goals. First among your current plans should be holiday and travel arrangements. Actually, long-distance contacts are as likely to involve work as pleasure.

LEO, Professional decisions should now become much easier and before another week is out you should have a far clearer idea of your wants and ideas. Your immediate concern, though, is probably financial. That'ss a good enough reason to get all your affairs in order. 
VIRGO, You may try to go easy on yourself; no matter what pressures you're under, you really should let go and enjoy yourself. Partners have much to teach you about letting your hair down, sowing wild oats and generally being irresponsible! Indulge yourself for a change. You deserve it! 
LIBRA, Partners are still a little confused, so wait another few days before attempting to resolve personal differences. The longer you delay your first move, the more information will be available and the easier everyone will find it to reach a reasoned agreement. READ | Shashi Tharoor, Kunal Kamra team up in a new stand-up comedy show that goes on air today 
SCORPIO, The Sun and Saturn are in a delicate relationship, signifying that practical and routine affairs should pass fairly smoothly. Yet you share with other people a tendency to petulance and a profound willingness to chance personal battles. But is it really worth the risk? Think about it! 
SAGITTARIUS, Get on with family arrangements while you can. If you are true to the Moon'ss delicate and emotional spirit, then you will accept new responsibilities and even treat colleagues at work as if they are part of one vast extended family. Every word of encouragement will be appreciated. 
CAPRICORN, Venus, that emotional planet, is creating personal doubts, but is still inclining you towards domestic entertaining and family gatherings. At work, you should consider fundamental issues and make personal relationships your priority. For a start, pay due respect to people in authority. READ | Motichoor Chaknachoor movie review: Astonishingly regressive AQUARIUS You must try not to alienate colleagues or close associates who have supported you through family or professional struggles. One particular aspect is endowing you with business skills. Someone may even get the idea that you are something of a financial wizard. 
TAURUS, If it's social gatherings you're interested in, there's one very particular planetary aspect which suggests fascinating meetings and intriguing encounters. Your financial stars are also very special so, if you are willing to make the right moves, you could land a healthy profit. 
GEMINI, The Moon is tending to make you a little self-righteous but, before you imagine that you are better than other people, please see to it that you have something to be genuinely proud of. Otherwise, try to be a little more humble: it will suit you! CANCER Ask yourself why it is that you should be attracted to people who have prestige and status? What is it they have that you lack, and how can you best supply these qualities for yourself? None of these questions has to be discussed with other people. And neither do your plans, for that matter! 
LEO, What matters most now is that you are getting much closer to resolving partnership or matrimonial problems. You see, partners hold the key to domestic harmony and you will get precisely nowhere unless you acknowledge this simple, basic truth. READ | Children's Day 2019: Speeches, inspirational quotes, and thoughts by famous personalities 
VIRGO, Unless a wrangle or conflict with a partner is resolved quickly, you may be forced to cancel long-standing arrangements. On the other hand, welcome news is about to arrive from afar. If you get fed up with waiting, then get out there and ask other people exactly what they're up to. 
LIBRA, Just one ray of hope shines over your financial situation: within the next seven days an offer or invitation which you had given up for good should be revived, much to your sheer delight. Perhaps all those years of effort will be shown to have been worth it. 
SCORPIO, You need to be less concerned about what other people think of you. Don't be too alarmed if you feel rather more withdrawn and inward-looking than usual. It will do you good to consider other people's actions and behaviour from your own unique standpoint. READ | Children's Day 2019: History, Importance, and Significance of Children's Day Celebration in India 
SAGITTARIUS, Somehow you have managed to both avoid defeat and to forge ahead with intensely personal ambitions, even if only in a small way. Now is the time to put proposals to partners, confident that they are ready to listen. You might have to force them to sit down and pay attention, though! 
CAPRICORN, Scintillating social aspects should break through the storm clouds and enable you to enjoy a number of useful get-togethers. Emotional attachments and travel plans will be highlighted, perhaps because there's a gulf to be bridged - or a rift to be healed. AQUARIUS The best planetary aspects now relate to plans already in the pipeline. You're still in command at home and nothing you let family members say or do should impede your wishes. Remember, though, that with responsibility comes a need for maturity and fairness to all. READ | Happy Children's Day 2019: Whatsapp Wishes Images, Status, Quotes, Wallpapers, Messages, Photos 
TAURUS, It's one of those times when the stars could push you to extremes. On the one hand, you'll be tending to become rather virtuous and self-righteous. On the other, you'll be happy to pull the wool over somebody's eyes. Keep a watch on rising costs, though. 
GEMINI, There is likely to be a sense of urgency about all career and professional matters, including those in which you are only involved at second remove. Today, though, I suspect that your mind may be on higher things. Perhaps you're fed up with the distractions of your daily routine. CANCER In love, you'll settle for life-long friendship rather than temporary passion. At work, this is one of those times when you are liable to fly off the handle, perhaps because you imagine your rights have been infringed or your worth unappreciated. For your own sake give other people the benefit of the doubt. 
LEO, Hopefully you will now realise that partners, colleagues and companions are entitled to question your ideas and opinions. You see, the Moon is giving the advantage to other people, and you might have some ground to make up. Don't worry - you can do it! 
VIRGO, One thing is certain, which is that you need to use tact and diplomacy when handling one special relationship. The problem lies not with you but with other folk, who are just too sensitive by half. Perhaps you'd do best to start by persuading them that you're on their side. 
LIBRA, Venus, your planetary ruler, is now in an aspect so sensitive as to be almost hysterical. It's so easy for love and devotion to be tipped over into anger and resentment, but there is no reason why this should happen if you act with typical Libran wisdom and maturity. 
SCORPIO, You are really extremely good at talking your way out of tight corners, and you should now use your verbal skills to ask for help and encourage others to come to your aid. Partners probably have a more realistic view of current possibilities than you. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Sun, that most noble of planets, is adopting a mature view of proceedings, encouraging you to take full responsibility for your own affairs. You should now make solid efforts to guarantee your long-term security. At the very least, you should balance your financial books. 
CAPRICORN, Hopefully common sense is prevailing, enabling you to refuse to make further compromises without risking confrontation. Today's lunar alignments put the accent on money, especially on your independent-minded approach. You might have to give a little now in order to receive more later on. AQUARIUS Congratulations! The Moon is now making its triumphal passage through a successful region of your chart. If you don't achieve a number of personal ambitions now, then you'll have to wait another month. Just don't get embroiled in irrelevant emotional rifts. 
TAURUS, I'd like to take a look at the next six days as a whole and point out that around mid-week, Mercury, planet of communication, will be very positive. The result is that plans and arrangements which have been blocked should be underway by the weekend. 
GEMINI, Events that took place over the last couple of weeks or so must have made it painfully clear that one close friend is taking you for granted. Not only that, but they may be a danger to themselves. You can be on hand with a supply of emotional sticking plaster. Also Read | Maharashtra govt formation: Difficult to stake claim within 24-hour deadline, say NCP insiders CANCER You're standing at a minor crossroads. On the one hand you'll feel a sense of deja-vu, perhaps a pleasurable bout of nostalgia. On the other, you know that you don't have any real choice but to prepare for the future. So, gird your loins and carry on! 
LEO, Venus, the ruler of your gentler affections, is inspiring you to dream of love. The only question is, of course, will partners respond? Leos who can arrange or implement travel plans or forge overseas links should get on with it: there is no time to waste. Also Read | Ex-Army officer's death in Tihar: Police say China link, Rs 65-cr FD 
VIRGO, It may now be clear that a major alteration in your work methods or routine is unavoidable. If you make an early start, you should do well, attracting support and admiration. It's not a particularly good time for dealing with details, which is precisely why you must take extra care. 
LIBRA, Those who now feel neglected or hard-done-by, should have taken the trouble to find out what makes you tick. If they'd bothered to try and see the world through your eyes some time ago, they would have given you no cause to complain now. Neither would they have let you down! 
SCORPIO, Declarations of love are one thing, but you may embarrass yourself as well as others. In fact, your foot may be well and truly wedged in your mouth! It goes without saying that your words need to be chosen with care. The last thing you want to do is undermine all the goodwill you've built up. Also Read | Which trust will build the temple? In Ayodhya, war of words breaks out 
SAGITTARIUS, Your creative energy should now be at a peak, but not perhaps because the stars are all on your side. On the contrary, challenging romantic stars remind us of the cliche that all great art stems from suffering! No gain without pain is a different way of doing it. 
CAPRICORN, On the plus side, today's subtle lunar relationships enable you to get the most out of almost any situation. Success will be guaranteed on the basis of your experience and skill. There is no need to bluff, or to pretend that you're something other than you are. AQUARIUS There's a great deal going on behind the scenes. In fact, almost everything of importance seems to be concealed from public view. What you see may be but the tip of a very large iceberg. Perhaps a close friend can help you view the secrets below the surface. 
TAURUS, Those of you who have intimate secrets should tread very carefully. On the one hand you may be tempted to go behind somebody's back, on the other, you must remember that the planets, and hence other people, are just not in a trustworthy mood. 
GEMINI, Your tricky planetary aspects may simplify practical matters but could complicate personal involvements. You're offered the chance to speed up financial transactions, especially inasmuch as they involve your home. But will family members see eye-to-eye? Well, yes, perhaps. CANCER The Moon's alignment with your house of relationships is bound to make you realise the importance certain other people play in your life. In fact, you will be reminded that, much as you think you can go it alone, you can't really survive without them. 
LEO, There's a romantic buzz in the air, one which should please and excite your Leonine soul. If there's anything you can do to make your immediate environment more colourful, then please do so now. You can expect unusual invitations, and visits from strange people. Also Read | The day after Ayodhya verdict: 27 years from Babri, healing and hurting 
VIRGO, The Moon reaches a vital stage in its cycle this week, which means that you should begin to wind up a number of projects. In particular, I'd say that legal matters and overseas links should now be settled. Stay one step ahead of family members and put forward your suggestions for domestic improvements. 
LIBRA, You may go about your daily affairs with a spring in your step. Even working Librans will be mainly preoccupied with family relationships and domestic obligations, so stay ahead of the game. Follow your instincts and don't be intolerant of others' little foibles. 
SCORPIO, The combination of Venus with Mercury and Jupiter makes you intensely well-meaning but, while hopes are high, the causes of misunderstanding lie around every corner and under every stone. Think before you open your mouth, or you're bound to say the wrong thing! 
SAGITTARIUS, Financial stars are looking decidedly healthy, and, believe it or not, there are a number of ways in which you can save or make money. Most of these relate to your domestic regime and family relationships. That's a good enough reason why you should ask partners to repeat themselves if you didn't listen last time. Also Read | He put fear of God in recalcitrant politicians, was respected by all… Good bye, Mr Seshan 
CAPRICORN, The Moon exerts a powerful role over your sign, an indication that the odds are stacked in your favour. If plans do go awry the problem may be that you are too emotional to adequately appreciate the real situation. Perhaps circumstances are not really as mysterious as you think. AQUARIUS Both partnership and professional interests are stressed by certain adverse planetary influences - and somehow the two seem to be linked. However, I doubt if there'll be any answers just yet - perhaps not for another four or five days. Patience suits you. 
TAURUS, Now that Mars and Venus are dominating both your emotional state and your domestic affairs, you must proceed as fast as you can to put all family and other close relationships on a proper footing. Aside from more serious issues, this is an ideal time for a spot of lavish and sensual entertaining. Horoscope Today, November 11, 2019: Aries, Taurus, Leo, Libra, Cancer, Scorpio, Gemini, and other signs  check the astrological prediction 
GEMINI, Mercury, the planet responsible for your brilliant ideas, is still on your side, and you can be as certain as you ever will be that decisions and choices you make now will be the right ones. As a matter of importance, you should also pay very close attention to financial developments and expenditure. CANCER Events in your personal life will begin to move faster and faster, although there will be periods when you come to a sudden full stop. It does not matter now whether your immediate interest is emotional, romantic, domestic, professional or financial: what is important is that you make a fresh start. 
LEO, Passions will be running high and if you feel that your approaches are ignored or belittled, or that you have been slighted or taken for granted, you may blow up. The last thing you want to do now is ruin your chances of a massive boost in a major ambition. Read | Ayodhya verdict: How the scales tilted in favour of temple parties 
VIRGO, Has somebody been going behind your back? Or have you not been entirely straight with someone? The best to be hoped for is either that you will gain recognition for your discreet and selfless activities, or that your worldly success will now shed new light on your emotional and spiritual place in the world. 
LIBRA, You just cannot decide whether you want everything to remain as it is, or to make a complete break. Initially, turn your attention to professional issues and make a quick decision. A personal dilemma deserves longer-term consideration, so don't rush it. 
SCORPIO, The week's developments at work will be dominated by personal relationships and, if you fall out with colleagues, you will damage your own prospects. The answer is simple - don't try to foist your ideas on people who don't need them. Try listening instead!

SAGITTARIUS, As a matter of principle, you should repay some of the generosity which has come your way. On a more mundane note, financial concerns are due to intensify. If this is the month for holidays you have planned well. By a happy coincidence, Mars and Venus are revealing an excellent prospect for romantic adventures abroad. 
CAPRICORN, Nothing takes place in isolation, and slight upsets will be opening the window on a remarkable series of emotional opportunities later in the year. It may be necessary, then, to be firm now, and insist that you get what you need out of a relationship, or at least that the issues are aired. Editorial | India, a temple, and a mosque AQUARIUS Stick to your preconceived notions of what people should do and when, and you will miss out and run the risk of confrontations over minor issues. Although you may not have received all the guarantees you need over money, what takes place now is bound to fire your imagination. 
TAURUS, You can't bottle your feelings up for ever. Share all your thoughts and feelings today, and take any short journeys that are necessary. Very soon, perhaps over the next few days, a major family or domestic improvement will be moving from number ten on your list to number one. 
GEMINI, It's a splendid day to shell out some cash, but the stars are making no distinction between minor purchases and major investments, like a new house or two. There is no way you will be able to cut costs for a little while longer, but at least you can avoid needless waste. CANCER You are in an excellent position to take the initiative, and should do so as soon as possible. Your lunar alignments put you in an almost unassailable position, and you should make sure that work is combined with pleasure. Hopefully employers and people in authority will appreciate your true talents. ALSO READ | Ayodhya verdict live updates 
LEO, A series of brilliant planetary aspects is setting you up for a very special period. Begin this phase today by making various discreet enquiries and keeping certain feelings to yourself. You should also take practical matters into your own hands, lest other, less competent people, overlook essential details. 
VIRGO, Partners may be making extra demands. You may continue to take the line of least resistance and give as much sympathy and support as you can. Don't fret, for any apparent retreat will be an advance in disguise. It's important that you lift your morale by letting your hair down socially. 
LIBRA, Relationships dominate your thinking. If this is true then your stars at the present are absolutely superb, and you should press ahead with radical changes at work or at home. Do realise, though, that everything depends on how other people react. Play your cards carefully. READ | Bala movie review: Hair we go again 
SCORPIO, You may be pulled in two directions, but then that gives you the chance to have your cake and eat it, doesn't it? Actually twenty-five hours per day will probably not be enough to accomplish all that is required at home or at work. Could your expectations be too high? I think they could! 
SAGITTARIUS, Money and financial transactions are the most important item of the day, but longer-term transits indicate that legal issues, foreign connections and educational aspirations are absolutely central. In matters of the heart it's friendship that you want. Passion can wait until later. 
CAPRICORN, Home, property and domestic concerns are crucial to your happiness. You may have your own ideas, but you may allow other people to take the lead; a close partner will protect your interests. Give social engagements a very high priority: friends expect no less. AQUARIUS One very major and historic planetary alignment is now in the past, but another, which is much more specific, is imminent and, whatever your wishes, whatever your ambitions, you should spare no effort over the next three days. There is no time to waste! READ | Tavleen Singh writes: Sending my son to exile 
TAURUS, You know how essential it is to talk to loved ones. It's vital to keep the dialogue going. Don't for one moment imagine that other people are telepathic, otherwise they'll misunderstand your intentions, you'll blame them, and they'll walk away! Say what you mean! 
GEMINI, If you wish to release a little pressure there seems no better way than a spot of shopping, even just of window shopping. It really does look like a time for treats and rewards all round, so don't stint. You've paid your dues and now it's time to cash in. CANCER Partners and employers will be impressed at just how well you combine your legendary compassionate qualities with resolution and determination, which may come as something of a surprise. You've got some big ideas, but you don't have to follow them all through just yet. Read | India vs Bangladesh, 2nd T20I: Trailing after Kotla loss, India sprint at Rajkot to draw level 
LEO, Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself if you wish. You may do best if you take another day or two to digest what's going on, probably at work. In the meantime, you must look anew at an old relationship, and figure out how you can make a loved one feel better. 
VIRGO, Spare a thought for your physical well-being. Your social stars are most obviously strong today, but one planetary sub-plot is giving you the opportunity to do something about a minor, but niggling, complaint. A romantic opportunity will require extra attention, by the way. 
LIBRA, Somebody you encounter over the next two or three days seems to be destined to become one of the most important people in your life during the next couple of months. This is surely enough to make you realise that you should not reject new contacts just because they don't meet your normal standards.

SCORPIO, Your planetary patterns are mixed, some pushing you forward, others holding you back. Unless family matters are pressing, put them to one side and concentrate instead on the professional situation. And, if you are about to get under way with a major new ambition, success should come fast. 
SAGITTARIUS, Business must go on. Recognising that moral and spiritual issues are very strong, you must still proceed with cash transactions and joint investments. In fact, if you have any plans for purchasing extra property, the stars are almost perfect. 
CAPRICORN, The romantic condition of the heavens is so pronounced that if you are single you'll be making long-term commitments and if you are already settled you'll be renewing your vows. Don't cramp your feelings, otherwise you'll miss out on this splendid period. Read | Rakesh Asthana case: Polygraph report says bribe claim appears truthful AQUARIUS You've got to take life one step at a time. It is necessary to complete all detailed and trivial chores, no matter how tedious. Indeed, the more thorough you are, the greater will be the respect and admiration which you are due to receive from far and wide. 
TAURUS, Everything I have said about increasing respect at work and comfort at home crystallises around planetary positions over the next forty-eight hours. You now have about ten to twelve weeks to press ahead in pursuit of your goals with total determination on all fronts. 
GEMINI, It looks increasingly likely that many of you may soon be taken abroad on account of work or some equally serious purpose. Even if you never leave your front door, something that happens on the other side of the world is due to make its mark on your imagination. CANCER You should consider the financial situation. Your stars today have nothing to say about immediate purchases and everything to say about the need to take care of the long-term - meaning pensions, savings, insurance and sundry guarantees. In all romantic matters your guiding principle should be 'home is where the heart is'. 
LEO, Your planetary positions in the next two days set the scene for the coming two months as far as you and your loved ones are concerned, so lift your sights from the daily grind and spare a thought for your purpose, place and destiny on this planet. 
VIRGO, Don't worry about being exploited or overworked. The more you put yourself out now and over coming weeks, the more amazing will be the consequences over future years. Just don't push yourself so hard that you end up flat on your back. That would never do! 
LIBRA, Life is never straightforward, even when it is supposed to be. There's a strange contradiction between romantic inhibitions and social confidence. The result of such a dynamic difference could be to transform your emotional life for better, once and for all! 
SCORPIO, Don't be deceived if everything seems terribly easy, even when help arrives from unexpected quarters. If you are gearing yourself up to make the greatest effort you've made for many months, then you are truly in league with the heavens. Besides, it's about time you struck a shrewd financial deal.

SAGITTARIUS, Friends and colleagues have different points of view and you seem to have one foot in each camp. Combine selfishness with selflessness in exactly equal measures and you won't go far wrong. Entrepreneurial activities are especially favoured, all the more so if a property deal is on the cards. 
CAPRICORN, The past few weeks have almost certainly proved dynamic socially, but there does now seem to be reason enough for an apology of sorts. Hopefully it was someone else who stood on a partner's toes, not you! Still, you can do your bit to create a better atmosphere. READ | Church in Kerala sets up sena, enlists ex-military men AQUARIUS You resemble a number of other people in the depth and profundity of your current planetary picture. Take a deep breath, for whatever you do now will have its full consequences in around six months' time. Don't rush it or you'll overlook essential details. 
TAURUS, You have a week or so to say what you think, tell family members what to do and arrange matters at home to your satisfaction. After that, you will become increasingly reluctant to communicate, perhaps because you worry that partners' reactions will not be to your liking. 
GEMINI, Don't imagine that you're helpless and incapable. If you're too passive today, fate will step in and you'll probably miss a very valuable opportunity indeed. Flex your muscles at home, and if people you live with know what's best for them, they'll agree with you without hesitation. Also Read | Not only Kudankulam, ISRO, too, was alerted of cyber security breach CANCER You may be putting on a show of being terribly confident and outgoing, but any astrologer will tell you that you're holding a lot back. That's no bad thing, for you have to be sure of what you really think before you tell other people how you truly feel. 
LEO, Slow down and consider your future with care. One way or another, you should be absolutely sure of what's happening before you make your next move. The whole world is knee-deep in banana skins, and if you take too much for granted, you'll be the first to slip. Also Read | Triggers behind Delhi's Tis Hazari row: Parking, lock-up, gunshot 
VIRGO, The overwhelming emphasis in your stars is on the public, professional, financial and social regions of your chart, indicating a predisposition to get involved in whatever's happening, even in activities that you'd normally think are beneath you. 
LIBRA, So many planets are encouraging you to excel yourself that I am sure you'll do better than usual. The daily planetary pattern is relatively adventurous, an indication that travel and long-distance plans require spicing up. All I can say is: keep your spirits aloft! 
SCORPIO, You can make requests, but you can't guarantee that they'll be granted. On balance, nobody is likely to give you the benefit of the doubt. But, then, if they did, you'd have it too easy. The general planetary picture suggests that, if you rise to the challenge now, you'll be all the more successful. Also Read | Pakistan Kartarpur song video has poster of Bhindranwale 
SAGITTARIUS, Personal relationships are a minefield. Other people do require a certain amount of sympathy, but they also need putting straight, and this might be the most important thing you can do for them. Have faith in your own advice, for it's better than you think. 
CAPRICORN, There's no rest for the wicked today, I'm afraid. If you've taken on more than you can handle then your responsibilities might start to divide and multiply, amoeba style. Can you hang on until tomorrow for help from partners? If you're smart, you may be able to deal with a familiar problem in a revolutionary manner. AQUARIUS Allow yourself a little more time for pleasure and self-indulgence. A cultural outing may suit, although really it doesn't matter what you do just as long as you enjoy it. Yet you're also in quite a serious mood, partly because you want only the best for partners. 
TAURUS, The fascinating relationship between the Sun, representing your public aspirations, and the Moon symbolising your private affairs, brings together areas of your life which are not always intimately connected. I'd say that this is a perfect time to reflect on the past and make a wish for the future. Also Read | Behind Govt's RCEP reluctance: Opposition from dairy to India Inc, Congress to Parivar 
GEMINI, One of your crucial planetary cycles concerns the passage of Mercury around your solar chart. This indicates that any current secretive tendencies will definitely be reinforced over the coming few weeks. Perhaps you have good reasons for keeping certain thoughts to yourself. CANCER This undoubtedly is going to be an extremely complex period, but you have a perfectly free choice as to how far you get involved. Nobody can force you to do anything against your will. My advice would be to enjoy all mysterious developments, but to know where to draw the line. Also Read | Maharashtra govt formation: Devendra Fadnavis gets Amit Shah nod for Shiv Sena talks 
LEO, The combined presence of old influences and new offers are certainly giving you pause for thought. There's an air of mystery, which may well mean that you are the cause of suspicion in other people's minds, so be tolerant and understanding. If someone appears to cause offence, then go easy on them: they might not mean it. 
VIRGO, You should lose no time if you have more adventurous or travel plans to finalise, or overseas contacts to cultivate. Family members far away would appreciate it if you got in touch, so take the initiative and make contact. You might even be pleasantly surprised. 
LIBRA, It's a fine moment to settle domestic spending, even to finalise a property deal. Legal matters may also be increasingly important, although for some of you it will be a foreign contact which dominates your thoughts. Try to lift your sights beyond trivial day-to-day concerns.

SCORPIO, That dynamic planet Mars is without a doubt encouraging you to become more adventurous, even if you still feel that someone close is holding you back. The first step may be to work out your finances, and you can do so just as soon as you have taken partners into your confidence. 
SAGITTARIUS, The true interpretation of current planetary influences is that thought, communication and study are vital. These principles underlie everything else in your life for another three months, and the message is that you'd better know what you're talking about. 
CAPRICORN, Other people's determination not to co-operate should by now have been replaced by an eagerness to join in. In point of fact, this may be no easier to deal with! Whatever the rights or wrongs of any particular situation, you should give partners the benefit of the doubt. AQUARIUS It can be confusing when the same facts point to different conclusions. If you are now told something in a rather curious manner, it may take you some time to discover what this particular person is actually trying to say. The conclusion is: don't jump to conclusions! 
TAURUS, Making choices is never easy, but sometimes it's necessary. Over the next three days you are going to have to come down off the fence and commit yourself one way or the other, even on minor matters. Once you've made up your mind, life will be considerably less complex. 
GEMINI, Money matters rise up the agenda. A great deal hangs on whether you are concentrating on saving or spending. One planet indicates one thing, another points to something completely different. All very enigmatic, I know, but the answer is that you'll have to listen to your own conscience. CANCER Your social and emotional influences are almost perfect but sufficiently flawed to remind you that you're just like any other human being. By all means reach for the stars, but keep a sense of perspective. The more realistic you are, the better your chances of success.

LEO, You are bound to feel less hurt by chance events or sayings if you realise that you're misunderstanding partners' intentions. It may seem that other people are going behind your back, but that's probably only because you're not being kept properly informed. 
VIRGO, If you are contemplating a new involvement in a group or society, then throw yourself in with gusto. The pleasure you gain from such contacts should far outweigh the obligations. Spare a thought for ethical issues today, and check whether your actions are right - or wrong. 
LIBRA, Mercury is linked to Venus, planet of charm, and the Sun, symbol of pride. You should therefore be full of your own ideas and you can plan ahead and plot a personal professional coup. Even in spare-time activities you will have a chance to make a name for yourself. READ | India vs Bangladesh: No Shakib, no problem  
SCORPIO, Other people are bound to take first place. Indeed, it seems desirable from your point of view that they do so. Your horoscope, you see, sometimes advises you to be selfish, but right now a spot of selflessness is the best way to achieve your goals. 
SAGITTARIUS, There is no escape from the daily grind today. Actually this is a rather positive forecast, for the more you accomplish now, the better able you'll be to take some time off in a couple of days' time. You see, your dreams will be so much more successful if you prepare the ground with care. 
CAPRICORN, Pleasure is where it's at today. You do have a puritanical streak, but self-indulgence has its place in the scheme of things, and right now you should follow the old dictum that a lot of what you fancy does you a great deal of good! Plus, at work, make sure your ideas are heard. ALSO READ | India Inc opposes Sebi directive on separating owner from management AQUARIUS First things first. You should deal with fundamental issues before you attempt to build castles in the air. Actually, I suspect that you have already realised that this is the only way to proceed, and that you are well in tune with the new mood of down-to-earth realism. 
TAURUS, Conditions in your solar chart are rather special at the moment. Looking back over the recent past, you can be proud of the way you have handled associates and colleagues who have tried to take you for a ride or assumed they can jump on your bandwagon. 
GEMINI, Very conveniently, Jupiter is now sending its benevolent powers in your direction. This means that you have exactly seven months to fulfil the promise that this generous planet has brought you. If you are a typical Gemini, you may still be feeling unsettled, but that is to be expected. CANCER The last thing you must do is imagine that the planets have it in for you. They are firmly on your side, and every hazard you meet, every difficulty you encounter, is a message to you to alter your approach or even to change direction. It's also vital to realise that you have the final say. 
LEO, At first sight it seems as if you can't really put a foot wrong, what with Venus and Mars so happily placed in your solar chart. Let's forget the psychological ramifications and emotional complexities and stick to simple predictions. This is an excellent month for all romantic associations. 
VIRGO, The indications in your solar chart are rather hard to decode at the moment. On the one hand, you are clearly determined to secure respect for your professional and public achievements and make absolutely sure you are noticed. 
LIBRA, It seems that you may have got yourself in a position where your aspirations to succeed on the career front are conflicting with your desire to have a happy and secure home. Out of such feelings may come resentment at either professional obligations or home commitments for holding you back. 
SCORPIO, There may be a hint of rough justice in the fact that someone else's loss is soon to be your gain. However, this will offer you an excellent opportunity to put your own interests to one side and come to the aid of those less fortunate than you. 
SAGITTARIUS, Most of you have now felt the benefits of one particular relationship throughout considerable areas of your life. Yet now you are moving towards a period when you must once again be standing on your own two feet, this time dealing with your affairs with greater maturity and wisdom than in the past. 
CAPRICORN, The long-term trends in your life this year and next are considerably more important than day-to-day ups and downs. This is not to say that striking events this month will not have major consequences for both personal and professional affairs. AQUARIUS Mars and Venus, the pair responsible for your passions, are stirring up your deepest feelings. And about time, too! If you forget your pride and ignore any slights or insults, you stand the chance of having a wonderful time, relishing emotional and romantic encounters and indulging yourself as never before. 
TAURUS, According to the basic laws of astrology, every extreme condition is balanced by its opposite. Therefore, you may find that one particular decision is about to be completely reversed. Certain decisions may be totally undone probably to your relief! 
GEMINI, Argumentative planetary aspects get you going, and I wouldn't be surprised if you spend part of the weekend walking around with your foot in your mouth. Still, you may be as much sinned against as sinning, so don't take all the blame. Do, though, realise that you can play your part in improving things. CANCER Only you know what needs to be done and how to do it. The snag is that you currently lack certain practical skills. You may also be too impatient to grapple with the necessary details. But, then, impatience is, after all, one of your less-known weaknesses! 
LEO, You may get tired of partners lecturing you, but you may just have to put up with it for now! Travel stars are very strongly emphasised, but you're probably not quite sure what you want or where you should go. The best bet is to arrange a trip somewhere inspiring, rather than an ordinary run-of-the-mill break. 
VIRGO, The problem today seems to lie in the ease with which happy-go-lucky events can suddenly turn into bad-tempered confrontations. The cause is people's readiness to pick up the wrong end of the stick, so it may be up to you to get the facts clear.

LIBRA, The Moon's relationship with the more subtle areas of your chart makes this a day which may be uneventful, but, when the general trend suits you, you'll pick up speed and achieve something quite unexpected. Your peacemaking skills will be extraordinarily useful. 
SCORPIO, The chances are that you will now have to lay down the law and set the world to rights. Friends, associates and loved ones must be made to see that, as far as you are concerned, they have over-stepped the mark. What you have to do now is get them back into line. 
SAGITTARIUS, This period does seem to be rather tense but in a good way. As far as you are concerned, the next few days may be considerably more pleasurable than the past week, with pressure to enjoy yourself all round. There might be a bit of emotional mopping up to be done first. ALSO READ | Chhath Puja 2019: Puja Vidhi, Muhurat Timings, Samagri, Mantra, Rituals, Procedure 
CAPRICORN, The Moon aligns with one of your travel houses, giving you due cause to take whatever short trips are on your mind. Given that it's a good day to hold discussions and negotiations, you will get your way if you follow the still, small voice of your intuition. AQUARIUS Appropriately enough, it's a good time for short journeys. Take quick trips and get out and about as much as possible. All you need to do is seize the initiative, rather than wait around until other people take the lead. Otherwise you might just begin to feel as if life is passing you by. 
TAURUS, Although you're normally among the most stable of people, you have been pushed this way and that by reckless impulses this week. You're still under planetary pressure to make impetuous decisions, based on the belief that things must and can only get better. 
GEMINI, By all means let partners make the first move. Indeed, a great many curious personal developments may occur if you sit back and allow fate to take its course. You may accept invitations you'd normally be minded to ignore, once you've checked all the ins and outs. Also Read | Surveillance via WhatsApp: On snoop target list—Rights lawyers to activists, DU prof to Defence journalist CANCER The Sun is so brilliantly positioned in relation to Jupiter that it seems almost inevitable that something is going to happen to change your life. Is it possible that a trivial event may have profound consequences in the months to come? The answer is a resounding 'yes'. 
LEO, Listen carefully to what other people say and accept all interesting offers as long as you leave yourself a get-out clause until you're absolutely certain. Your charitable and idealistic impulses are now being triggered, as is your interest in foreign cultures and exotic climes. 
VIRGO, The Sun's relationship with Jupiter only emphasises what I've already said about this week, namely that you have a chance to stop being a hidebound, conventional Virgo and develop your untapped adventurous qualities. Let other people pick up the pieces. Also Read | Maharashtra govt formation: In touch with BJP, Congress &amp; NCP, says Uddhav Thackeray 
LIBRA, You are aware how many difficulties or dramas could have been avoided had you only used different words. However, this is a time to look to the future with hope in your heart, not a moment for regret. What is done is done, and you should make sure that in future you'd do it differently. 
SCORPIO, Somebody at home definitely seems to be in a pushy mood and you may have to give way if trouble is to be avoided. There's a high probability of unexpected domestic chores and you should keep your list of handy repairmen ready. You may also need a friend to come in and fix up emotional upsets. 
SAGITTARIUS, There are certain times when challenging planetary aspects seem to throw the field wide open and this is one of them. You are not one to fear change and insecurity, so the current period should advance your interests. What you have to do is keep your eye on your long-term goals. 
CAPRICORN, You appear to be trying hard to make everyone feel secure and comfortable, perhaps too hard. Of course partners and family members are quite capable of looking after themselves, but it suits them to have you running around after them. But, in my opinion, there's no reason why anyone should imagine that you're an unpaid servant. AQUARIUS Personal pressures can only make you more determined than ever to realise certain goals and ambitions. At the same time, you must be prepared to admit that flexibility and compromise are essential if you are to succeed. Watch the way the wind blows and then make your decision. 
TAURUS, On no account allow loved ones or other members of the family to undermine your confidence and self-esteem. You are far too vulnerable at the moment and must try to toughen yourself up. Don't build emotional molehills into insuperable, unclimbable mountains. 
GEMINI, The Moon's relationship with Mars is rather curious. But why, you ask, should this bother you? Well, for a start you should watch out for legal complications, so don't transgress any laws. Secondly, you must avoid people who are fighting battles of principle. CANCER Financial affairs may intrude into your consciousness today, though I don't think there'll be any difficulties. It's more likely that you'll see a way to prosper from some sort of joint investment or spending. However, while your instincts may be bang on, if final agreements happen to be delayed for a few days then you might learn something to your advantage.

LEO, You're now into an extremely bright social period which should last over the next two days. If you want to make the most of your life, put dull commitments to one side and make more time for sheer pleasure. And remember that some people close to you are under great strain and need your consideration. 
VIRGO, The pleasant side of work, whether formal employment or domestic chores, is to be found in personal relationships. So, whatever you're doing, make it your first priority to team up with other likeminded people. This, I feel, is a time for all people of goodwill to stick together. 
LIBRA, Events over the next few days should improve the working pattern of your life. The price, though, may be your willingness to say goodbye to ties or associations which have outlived their usefulness. It's a law of life that all endings are followed by new beginnings, so look on the bright side. Also Read | Sena climbs down, BJP signals ready to give it Dy CM post, 13-15 berths in govt 
SCORPIO, If ever there was a time to change tactics at home, this is it. You may revitalise family relationships and help useful enterprises on their way. You probably understand current difficulties better than anyone, which means that you're in the best position to do something about them. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may have to cancel long-standing arrangements to keep the peace with associates and loved ones. However, any venture that is abandoned will quickly be replaced by one that is more to your taste. That, at least, is the theory. In practice, nothing will happen unless you make the right moves. 
CAPRICORN, This is without a doubt bound to be one of the most family-focused periods of the year for you. It's worth bearing in mind that you won't be truly successful as far as worldly ambitions are concerned unless you feel emotionally secure. If you have any secret fears, then your first step should be to seek reassurance. Also Read | J&amp;K becomes UT today amid attempts to create space for political alternative in Valley AQUARIUS Personally, and professionally, this should be a rewarding phase. The number of planets acting solidly in your support is now increased to three, which means that there is nothing that can faze you. You can probably talk the hind legs off a donkey, which is a nice way of saying that you can persuade almost anybody to do almost anything! 
TAURUS, You can take advantage of growing planetary alignments with secretive sectors of your chart to increase your privacy and spend a little more time by yourself. Over the next few weeks, peace and quiet will be a commodity in increasing demand, and there's no reason why you should reveal all to people with whom you're uncomfortable. 
GEMINI, That sensitive sign, Pisces, has been having its say in your life and your instincts have been telling you to bide your time over career and professional issues. However, you may now put delicate considerations to one side and press ahead with your usual vigour. CANCER The Moon is casting its rays far and wide, especially over those sections of your chart with responsibility for close and intimate partnerships. Friendships with people who are older, more mature and experienced should be favoured, especially if there's any chance that you might end up living together. READ | Day/Night Tests: A low-down on the requirements and conditions 
LEO, It looks like a hard-working day. There's a general air of excitement, but today is a good time to get your shoulder to the wheel and press ahead with routine but highly necessary chores. My only concern is that you might push yourself too hard. 
VIRGO, Almost any Virgo will tell you that the working week is not designed for fun, but for honest toil. However, the planets are in a slightly chaotic mood, and with the Moon quite sensitive today you must give absolute priority to pleasure, romance and cultural excursions. 
LIBRA, Jupiter, the ruler of opportunity and enthusiasm is the planet of the moment. If professional ambitions are at the top of the agenda the outcome can only be good. The one problem is your tendency to inadvertently offend those whose support you. Put yourself at their disposal and they won't forget it. READ | KBC 11: The Rs 3,20,000 question that made Beenaben Pravinbhai quit 
SCORPIO, Although financial indications are relatively benign, you need to do your sums and ensure that you are not making a rod to beat yourself with. Don't take on commitments you won't be able to keep, especially if you are under duress from partners to make a quick agreement. 
SAGITTARIUS, Something that brought you up short recently should not be allowed to make you feel undermined or demoralised. You are too big a person and the future is too bright, to allow you to carry resentment around for much longer. If you feel that somebody else has been unfair then you can't really do anything about it until you have found exactly the right approach.

CAPRICORN, The Sun and Mercury are sparkling away in your solar chart, bringing fresh light to areas of your life that have long been buried deep beneath a mountain of emotional verbiage. Now's the time to break free, perhaps while someone who has been blocking your path is looking the other way! AQUARIUS Be prepared to take even enforced changes at home in your stride. The Moon is currently making it difficult to get one or two personal issues straight, but within a few days all will be made crystal clear and you might even find out what the alternatives are. 
GEMINI, You may still feel a little out on a limb or out in the cold, but there's a great deal you can do to re-establish ordinary human contact. The influence of that energetic sign Aries will soon have you back on form, boosting your social confidence and giving you the edge over your rivals. CANCER It's at work that the main problems are likely to crop up. This may come as a surprise to those of you who imagine that personal affairs are most important. Intimate and family issues should be dealt with smoothly over the next forty-eight hours if possible! 
LEO, You've done well, no doubt about that. However, you can best make further progress by offloading some financial responsibilities and cutting your costs. Allow loved ones to take over the reins if you think you can trust them. If you can't, then you can at least offer them some constructive advice. 
VIRGO, There are some wonderful planetary alignments this week to encourage and sustain you, including aspects to Jupiter, the planet of reckless optimism. It's a week to go wild socially, if that's not too out of character. But one word of warning: if you do let your hair down then anything could happen; and I mean anything! 
LIBRA, Venus and Mars are in their own ways both so constructive that we can only conclude that for once you feel like a square peg in a square hole. In other words, you are getting on very well indeed. Just one condition, though, you need to clear up all unfinished emotional business. 
SCORPIO, It's a superb moment to cut through your routine chores and daily tasks with a spot of lateral thinking. You know full well that there are ways to be more efficient with your time and resources, and now may be the moment to cut out the dead wood that's been holding you back. 
SAGITTARIUS, In many ways you're walking an emotional tightrope, but even today there's an impetuous mood in the air which suits you. You'll be free to chop and change and cancel agreements, but don't be surprised if more conventional people look askance at your behaviour. 
CAPRICORN, The most advantageous sectors of your solar chart at the moment are without a doubt those pointing to your financial fortunes. Although it looks as if there'll be a slight hiccup in personal matters, business relationships should be perfectly profitable. AQUARIUS Your social stars are still very strong and, although one friendship or attachment should have weathered recent storms, you must now ensure that you are not getting too carried away by your thoroughly individual emotions. What you need now is a sense of stability. 
GEMINI, You're coming to the end of a brief cycle which has brought a surge in your personal ambitions and welcome professional developments. There'll be one last emotional push at the end of the week, and you'll have the confidence to forge your own path whether partners support you or not. CANCER No matter how misjudged or angry you feel, think twice before you try and settle any old scores. This is one of those weeks when a chance remark could start a full-scale war, so tread warily. The fact is that someone close to you is under incredible pressure, and they need your help and understanding. 
LEO, Obviously, a great deal has happened in the past which has caused you grief or just plain irritation - in that you're not unusual. However, unless you decide to wipe the slate clean now, some adverse planetary aspects this week may stir up a number of continuing dramas.

VIRGO, What a perplexing time this is. However, planetary movements over the next few days bring welcome changes. In particular, friends and partners who have been out of sorts will regain their composure. But you may also have to patch up a partner's emotional bruises. 
LIBRA, You may now need to spend more time on your own and not expend so much energy keeping up a front. In addition, relations with children now seem to be more important. Younger family members will show you the way to enjoy yourself, so don't stand on ceremony. 
SCORPIO, Your personal stars are under a little pressure, which is why you may need to dispose of some unwanted emotional baggage this week. Today's lunar position emphasises meetings, interviews and unusual discussions - anything which can ease the path of your work and daily routine.

SAGITTARIUS, The Moon aligns with highly intuitive sectors of your chart for much of the day, so you should find yourself fully in tune with the general mood of the times. Financial hopes and cares may occupy much of your attention, especially if you're being overwhelmed by commonsense and a realisation that it's right to plan ahead. 
CAPRICORN, You have been forced to redefine your role on a number of occasions over the last year or so, often with great personal difficulty. Over the next few days you'll receive a hint that it was indeed all worth it but, if hidden worries come up, then face them head on. AQUARIUS Mars and Venus are currently such a splendid couple of planets that you can afford to feel happy and confident, even if life is a little too complicated. Grasp every nettle in sight and amaze loved ones by backing your imagination, instincts, intuitions and hunches. 
GEMINI, Social stars couldn't be better, and you may be able to make up for a recent disappointment. At work there may still be a slight muddle, but you have made positive progress and within a few more days you'll know exactly where you stand. Romantic prospects look best towards the end of the week, so save up your emotional energy. CANCER You do not make life easy for yourself, but you must now lighten up a little. As the week goes by, you may shift your attention from partnerships to money and eventually to ambitious plans to promote yourself in your community. People are waiting to hear from you, so stop being so shy, or reluctant to show your true talents. 
LEO, Bountiful good fortune is still yours for the asking, but you now have no choice but to pay much more attention to what others are doing. The people who are important in your life must be older, wiser and more experienced, and you need to rely on their stability. You have much to give as well, and the time will come when you can shine.

VIRGO, This week's Sun and Moon patterns offer a sure sign that you'll be toeing the line. Relationships will be blooming, and you must link up with fresh people on new enterprises. Your spending may remain high, perhaps because there's a little extra to spare for luxuries. A professional surprise is looming, and when it comes it could open new vistas. 
LIBRA, Even minor differences with partners will need urgent resolution. Mercury and Venus will raise the social profile slightly, bringing contacts which are stimulating intellectually as well as loving emotionally. At work, there are more routine chores to come. You have to clear the mundane detail before you can get to the excitement. 
SCORPIO, The present romantic phase will be brought to an end before long. In fact, within a few days, you'll have to put certain frivolous pre-occupations behind you and get up to date with work. Also, as it happens, joint financial arrangements could bring in extra funds. So, if a partner comes up with a profitable idea, give it your serious thought. ALSO READ | On Diwali, readings of the Ramayana show us the light, as well as warn us against the darkness 
SAGITTARIUS, Although a financial complication may be in an urgent state at the beginning of the week, within a few days, everything should be nicely settled. Deal with home and family engagements around the middle of the week. There's little pressure at work, at least none that you shouldn't be able to take in your stride. Midweek brings the best stars at work. 
CAPRICORN, Attend to all your tasks and chores promptly. Then you'll be able to enjoy all social activities without a guilty conscience! If you can get long-term finances sorted out now, please do so. You should also hold discussions with family members as soon as you can, otherwise you may risk losing control of important developments. And that's the last thing you want! AQUARIUS You should now be feeling more secure in yourself, and better able to stand up to other people. Prosperous patterns emanating from sensitive regions of your chart suggest that this is a fine week to handle financial negotiations and treat yourself to a few extra luxuries. Don't be slow to take advantage of financial offers, but avoid hidden strings. 
GEMINI, This really is a special time. Only one planet directly influences your sign, but that one, Venus, is both poetic and a bringer of beauty. Your major asset right now is therefore your smile. It's amazing how far a little goodwill will ease your path. CANCER There seems little doubt that renewed determination should see you through. Although there is great scope for confusion and misunderstanding today, if your goals are imaginative and far-seeing you will get your way at home, with good consequences for everyone. 
LEO, Events that transpired recently may have made you a little doubtful about your, or a partner's, professional actions, but today you may forget such concerns and get on with your own very private activities. Put your dreams into practice: you may not have a second chance. READ | JJP in after outrage over Kanda: Dushyant gives Khattar and BJP the numbers, gets No. 2 
VIRGO, Your day-dreams tend to take place on a vast and grandiose scale at the moment. Today, however, you may wish to take the plunge and see how your imaginings work out in the real world! You may need expert help, but somehow I feel that for once you are on top. 
LIBRA, There's pressure at home today with a high chance of unexpected developments early on and the occasional personal muddle by midday. This doesn't mean that you'll have a bad time. Far from it - life could be increasingly enjoyable if you look on the bright side. 
SCORPIO, Romantic relationships look distinctly expensive at the moment. However, you may now indulge an adventurous urge, no matter what the cost. You can look overseas for inspiration or, at the very least, introduce a touch of the exotic into your everyday life.

SAGITTARIUS, If you leave too many decisions to other people you may abdicate responsibility, but this may be no bad thing. There is often something to be said for allowing chance to take a hand and waiting to see what fate turns up. You never know - you might be pleasantly surprised. 
CAPRICORN, It must be comforting to know that other people love you, but the air-waves may be thick with confusing and contradictory messages today. Watch out for someone who seems to be growing increasingly touchy - maybe there is something you can do to help. AQUARIUS This should be a busy day, perhaps with an erratic beginning and a confusing middle. As far as your health is concerned, today is a fine moment to get into a new fitness regime. This doesn't mean cutting out your favourite little indulgences, by the way. READ | Ever since 2012, India Inc prefers to hire labour minus a contract 
GEMINI, By all means make a fuss and stamp your foot, especially if money is changing hands. It doesn't matter whether you're popping to the corner shop or moving a fortune around the world, you know what you want. And other people must listen! If they don't, then they'll lose out. CANCER Yours is a dual sign, acutely sensitive one moment, pugnacious the next. You're going to combine both elements today, which means you'll have to pick your target carefully or rue the consequences. If you blame the wrong person then they'll be out to get their own back!

LEO, Deep within your psyche there lies a fair amount of anger. At the moment this is unconscious, but even buried feelings can distort your everyday behaviour, so do try not to take resentments out on people who have done nothing wrong, however strongly you feel. 
VIRGO, The whole emphasis in your chart is slanted towards public affairs, both social and professional. It therefore stands to reason that you will do your best if you are out in the world, meeting and overcoming new challenges. There's nothing to be gained from burying your head in the sand. Explained | Resurgence of Pawar with Congress riding piggyback, and fissures within BJP-Sena 
LIBRA, You may now begin to feel that the carpet is being pulled from under your feet at home. Don't be unduly concerned if you imagine that you are being undermined or pulled back to the past, for you will eventually see the benefits of a backwards step. 
SCORPIO, What you really must do now is ensure that legal questions are faced fair and square. Also, get in touch with family members who are far away or overseas. And, lastly, do finalise travel plans, otherwise you'll find that you've missed the boat or lost your way! Also read |  In Haryana, Dushyant emerges as new Chautala 
SAGITTARIUS, You have to cope with so many personal changes that you may not have time to catch your breath. Rearranging social engagements is one thing, but you will probably do best to concentrate on necessities, like the money situation: it's time to settle your debts and balance the books. 
CAPRICORN, Venus' profoundly pleasant relationship with Saturn is excellent from the financial stance, pointing to a steady increase in your earnings as a result of your own past efforts. It also encourages you to make personal vows: luck doesn't come into it. Movie review: Made In China-A tale of vim-and-vigour-laced-with-viagra AQUARIUS Saturn, a planet representing fate, is tied to your sign via an aspect signifying free will. This is therefore a profound moment which shows that your personal desires are harmonised with life's deeper purpose: it's your self-discipline which saves the day. 
GEMINI, Take no notice of people who seem to trying to deceive, exploit or overcharge you. Believe it or not, you have much more control over your financial situation than you imagine. I would advise you to seek watertight guarantees in return for every commitment. Maharashtra, Haryana election results 2019: Follow LIVE updates here CANCER The simple truth of the matter is that you may be the cause of a little friction. To an extent this is unavoidable, for you must do what must be done. However, you should also avoid treading on toes unless absolutely necessary, even inadvertently. 
LEO, Stunning planetary aspects are always welcome, but they don't necessarily encourage you to do what you want. Today, you must do what is essential, and that means playing fair by others. Also, try to follow the spirit of the law by giving rivals the benefit of the doubt. Haryana Election Results 2019: Click here to follow LIVE updates 
VIRGO, At work it is who you know that's important. Don't worry about being efficient. It's not the number of words per minute that counts, but the size of your smile and the frequency of encouraging comments that will win support. If you cheer other people up, then they'll respond in kind. 
LIBRA, There should be fewer arguments or conflicts about major issues in future. However, you're now entering a period when people are likely to be increasingly irritated by what seems to be your failure to accept the facts as they see them. They're probably wrong, but you'll never convince them of that! Maharashtra Election Results 2019: Click here to follow LIVE updates 
SCORPIO, It's time for some serious forward planning. Looking ahead, you can now anticipate illumination in the partnership department. Deep down, you know that there are a number of major obstacles to be cleared, and it seems from your chart as if they are indeed about to be swept out of the way. 
SAGITTARIUS, Consistency is a virtue, and if you stick to your opinions all will be well. Other people are likely to be attracted to you, even romantically, if they see you as someone who is sensible and wise. It's a busy moment, by the way, so don't let routine tasks pile up. 
CAPRICORN, Instead of being morose because you lost out in the past, how about having a stab at becoming a success in the future? It is never too late, and partners are now ready to respond to your challenge. You respect people who are prepared to stand up to you much more than those who agree with your every word. Read | In first test after Article 370 move, J&amp;K votes in block polls today AQUARIUS Relationships with children and younger relatives should be showing an improvement. There is every indication that such people, in company with the rest of us, will look up to you all the more if you express your real feelings. In love, the golden rule is to keep talking. 
GEMINI, There are times when we all must come forward and take control. Today is your moment to shine, so don't evade your responsibilities. Remember that emotional power carries with it obligations to those who are relying on you: you can't let other people down without storing up problems for yourself. CANCER There are two major options today. Either you will be shelling out on some worthy charitable cause, or you will be the lucky recipient of a discreet show of generosity. In each case the regions of your chart ruling money, selflessness and generosity are linked. 
LEO, Perhaps the most difficult thing for you to accept at the moment is that other people may be right. May I ask you to remember over the next three months that in this imperfect world of ours the truth is always relative. All points of view may therefore be equally valid. 
VIRGO, Harmonious professional relationships are now crucial, so whatever the changes or disturbances taking place on the work front at the moment, it is safe to forecast they will all have a very favourable outcome - even if you have to wait longer than you expected. 
LIBRA, What took place recently may have reminded you of just how good life is. Actually, from the spiritual point of view it is always useful to be reminded of our place in the scheme of things, so count yourself lucky! A loyal partner deserves your thanks, by the way. 
SCORPIO, A little judicious spending will go a very long way towards solving a couple of knotty problems. If you want to get ahead at work, for example, investment in a new image may pay dividends. And if you want to win support at home, a well-targeted gift could do the trick. 
SAGITTARIUS, The reason why some partners or business associates are so charming may be difficult to fathom. Why not just put it down to the fact that Venus, planet of polite behaviour and gracious manners, is making a powerful aspect to your sign? Good old-fashioned etiquette may be best. 
CAPRICORN, If you are to make sense of your worldly ambitions then you must get back into the mainstream and start again. However, within about four days you will realise that a period of contemplation is not only desirable, but is essential. The answers to your questions may lie within. AQUARIUS You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by going in for a bout of sheer self-indulgence. It really doesn't matter whether your pleasures are sober and serious or utterly frivolous. All that matters is that you set out to enjoy yourself. 
GEMINI, Although it may go against the grain, you will have to smile sweetly, no matter what other people say or do. It is undoubtedly a perfect time for forgiveness, even if others are going all out for revenge. A soothing word will completely take the wind out of their sails. Also Read | Exit polls call it for the BJP: NDA set to sweep Maharashtra and Haryana CANCER You seem to be angry about an emotional or family question, though whether you can do anything about it is another matter. Given that you will indeed be able to right an injustice, the question now is where to start? You might have to begin at the end and work back! 
LEO, It is surely better to stick to methods which are tried and tested and have proved themselves over the past few months. One thing you have to strive for is respect from partners and associates, and this will come if you show that you are prepared to be true to your word. Also Read | US Congress panel to discuss Jammu and Kashmir today 
VIRGO, Moral and ethical considerations are vital, for it's important that you do the right thing. You may not gain materially from being noble and selfless, but you will surely boost the quality of your life. Optimism is the theme for the next twenty-four hours. 
LIBRA, In a matter of days the Sun will have altered its position, putting the onus on you to improve your financial situation. Joint arrangements will be most significant, so preserve and build on all important relationships. Somebody is waiting for you to make the first move. 
SCORPIO, You're honestly not sure whether private or public life is more important. Perhaps other people can help you, so why not ask around? For once partners are in a very good position to offer a helping hand, and it may become clear that you can indeed pursue different options at the same time.

SAGITTARIUS, Take the fullest possible advantage of today's amazingly favourable planetary aspects to lift your spirits. It matters not whether your life is easy or difficult, just as long as you keep things in perspective. Also, only make commitments you know that you can stick to. 
CAPRICORN, You seem to be reorganising your home, but you are also about to change your mind about what you want. The only way to tackle family relationships is through realising that nobody, not even you, can ever be free of the past. You can be fully independent and fulfil your duties at the same time. AQUARIUS An unusual amount of planetary activity in sensitive regions of your chart is drawing your attention to certain quibbles and queries at home. Problem-solving is now on the agenda, so get on with creating a brighter future. The past may seem like a golden age, but your memory might be playing tricks on you. 
GEMINI, You're now in a charming phase. Surprised? You may not be, but some of your associates certainly will be. Yet the dominant planet in your life is no longer abrasive Mars but gentle Venus. That's why it's time for friendly co-operation rather than fierce confrontation. CANCER You thought you had made your mind up, but what takes place today will make you think again, probably regarding joint financial commitments. An extravagant offer, on the other hand, will provide a valuable boost to your morale and set you up for the future. 
LEO, Jupiter is fighting a celestial battle with Saturn, but Venus is about to mediate between these two warring forces. The benefits will arrive very soon when a close ally, perhaps a woman, intercedes with someone who has been trying to hold you back. 
VIRGO, Why don't you spare a little time for dealing with travel plans. Holiday arrangements may be finalised and all overseas contacts should be assiduously cultivated: you could well be taking a journey for business rather than just pleasure. Also, keep an eye open for legal complications this afternoon. 
LIBRA, The whole point about your current stars is revealed by Mercury's odd behaviour: other people, mainly close partners, will be acting erratically and will change their minds without warning. You must cultivate tolerance and flexibility - and keep the peace. 
SCORPIO, You are far too bright to be taken in by people who are telling you what you can or can't do at home or in your private life. If you know what's best, you will form alliances with partners who will back you to the hilt: there's no point in hanging around with people who don't care. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sometimes good fortune comes in strange forms, and you should be content if the day brings more than your fair share of responsibilities. The more you accomplish over the next forty-eight hours, the better able you will be to appreciate social developments after then. 
CAPRICORN, Those revolutionary and inspired planets, Uranus and Neptune, are behaving like a couple of synchronised swimmers, ducking and diving through your chart. Behind every apparently trivial event this week will lie a deeper purpose as your destiny unfolds. AQUARIUS Your innate resistance to change is strong and growing stronger. There is nothing wrong with this. In fact, if romance, pleasure or self-indulgence are among your goals, you may do very well indeed. Only in the most practical of family matters may flexibility be necessary. 
GEMINI, Mercury, your planetary ruler, is facing a rather intense and emotional region of your horoscope, making it more necessary than ever to take a considered and mature view of your work and friends. When professional matters are considered, you will probably discover that a colleague has been labouring under a misunderstanding. CANCER Creative, passionate and artistic Cancerians will be on fine form, tackling new opportunities with great courage. Relations with children should improve, and mixing with younger people in general may be good for your morale. Above all, you are entering a phase when it's your needs and desires that could come first. Read | Ayodhya hearing: Counsel for Ramlalla seeks disputed, acquired land for temple 
LEO, Many Leos are getting the idea that they want to move home, or push through some sort of family revolution. I doubt that your stars are strong enough for such an extreme event, but the focus of all change will definitely be at home. A professional circumstance may now shift from being a problem to an advantage. 
VIRGO, There's a natural streak of pessimism in your character - you always expect the worst. That's good when it helps you steer clear of the trouble that other people blunder into, but if you squander amazing opportunities, you'll live to regret it. There will come a time when you must attend to a relation's frustration. Also read | Govt flags ‘gaps' in Rahul Gandhi's SPG detail 
LIBRA, All of a sudden, you're beginning to look like a potential millionaire - at least from the celestial perspective. The only question is - can you make that final, necessary leap of faith? Only when family matters are cleared up will you be free to tackle a public or professional ambition. So, remember the golden rule, first things first! 
SCORPIO, The planets are all piling into sensitive and ambitious regions of your chart as if there's no tomorrow. Mars and Mercury alone should be enough to kick-start you into top gear. Within two weeks you'll be cruising along nicely. You may have to think twice about a recent romantic proposal, perhaps because long-range goals have to be matched against short-term desires. 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll be very wary about letting on about your true intentions to friends and partners. This may be wise, for the potential for disagreement seems to be high. Don't worry about a temporary dip in morale, though, and take whatever steps are necessary to get your confidence back up again. Financial luck, even in a small way, will boost your spirits.

CAPRICORN, You social stars are strong as usual, but you'll want something different out of your entertainment. A sense of commitment, meaning or purpose combines with a taste for danger and low-life. Once you are sure of your ground, you may make a bid for promotion at work. And, if you are under stress at the moment, feel free to blame the stars. AQUARIUS Ambitious Aquarians will be on the crest of a wave, but let me offer you one word of advice: in personal affairs as well as public, don't take other people for granted or offend their sensibilities. Money luck is more likely at the end of the week than the beginning but, ultimately, whether you make a profit depends on your sense of timing. 
GEMINI, You may look far afield for adventure and interest. If you're travelling today the end results could be very far-reaching, perhaps because the people you meet or the places you see will transform your life's ambitions. And don't let today's tension get to you. CANCER A continuing planetary emphasis on money, in all its forms, eclipses any other consideration in your chart. Sooner or later every question will come back to a matter of value, cost and material security. Even intimate relationships could run aground when it comes to deciding who pays for what. 
LEO, One factor still holds supreme - your emotional and dramatic lunar aspects. If you're feeling sorry for yourself then you've picked up the wrong end of the stick, so get up, get on out there and play the game of life for all it's worth. It's simpler than it seems. 
VIRGO, Don't shrink from taking on more responsibilities but, by the same token, if you are to fulfil all promises and obligations, you may have to shed a few marginal commitments. It's all a matter of good organisation. A partner may cause confusion, but nothing you can't handle. 
LIBRA, The only possible area of concern or commitment involves work so, if this doesn't apply to you, you may take this opportunity to indulge yourself in any and every enjoyable activity you can think of. And, if younger relations need help, make sure it's constructive. 
SCORPIO, You may feel that all is not quite right at home, but there are as many indications of helpful developments as of unhelpful ones. It's important to focus on formal arrangements and on those relationships which display a genuine degree of commitment. 
SAGITTARIUS, Any discussions will very easily become bogged down in details, excessive caution or cries of 'you'd never get away with it' or 'you couldn't afford it'. There may be a point to such objections, but you'll have to summon up your courage and take your own decisions. 
CAPRICORN, You could still be forced to deal with financial issues which may be too big for any one person, but a new and helpful factor is now introduced into the equation. You should therefore consider the ethical issues and assert your own unique and individual rights. AQUARIUS Serious developments should now be conferring certain benefits upon you. However, the first lesson you must learn is that change is not always easy, and that other people may not share your ambitions. That's something they'll have to come to terms with. 
GEMINI, The stars are packed with useful advice today: if you're travelling, leave nothing, not even the merest detail, to chance; if there's a legal dispute on the cards, make sure you know your rights. And if a partner forgets where they are or what they're doing, be patient! CANCER The most useful way to absorb today's somewhat peculiar planetary influences is to concentrate on your material and financial security. Quite simply, it's the right moment to crack open the piggy bank. But you can also call in some emotional favours. 
LEO, There's bound to be a steady accumulation of emotional tension throughout the day, as the Moon gradually moves towards its next dramatic position. You may need a steady nerve if someone seems determined to test your patience, so don't over-react - no matter how much you're provoked. 
VIRGO, One area of your chart I haven't mentioned for some time is that ruling your physical well-being. It is therefore appropriate to mention that today's stars give you the chance to take long-term measures to deal with an equally long-standing complaint. 
LIBRA, Artistic and creative Librans are singled out for praise by today's solar supporters and lunar allies, and you should let rip and make your mark upon the entire known world. That includes ninety-nine per cent of all Librans! How about pretending you're an assertive Aries for a change? 
SCORPIO, If you have any long-term alterations in mind at home, today would be a good time to start. Those of you planning a change of residence, or any improvements of similar magnitude, should find that events move very fast. In fact, you may soon have to hang on tight. 
SAGITTARIUS, A tendency towards serious misunderstandings is qualified by an equal recognition of the need to make hard-headed, long-term choices. All travel plans should be pursued free from sentiment or frills of any kind. If you want to go somewhere new, then do so because you want to, not because you're under emotional pressure. 
CAPRICORN, You could now be approaching a major watershed in your financial affairs. You must be prepared to sustain a small loss in the interests of long-term profit, but do realise that the important consideration is security. Safety and comfort actually mean more to you than some people often realise. AQUARIUS There will be a fair amount of tension in the air, but the useful way to approach today's cosmic potential is by offering a chance for a completely fresh start in whatever area of activity you choose. Make your decisions, issue invitations - and follow them through. 
GEMINI, You are standing on the brink, pulled between two vital Geminian qualities. You can be terribly logical and discreet, but you also have a tendency to open your mouth and put your foot in it at the slightest excuse. There must surely be a middle way! Karwa Chauth 2019: Puja Vidhi, Timings, Muhurat, Samagri, Mantra, Vrat Katha, Moon Rise Timings CANCER Partners are bound to raise certain obstacles, but these shouldn't be seen as unwelcome. If partners come up with advice which is at first impression rather upsetting, don't be dismayed, but look for the deeper truth. The real facts might offer reassurance. 
LEO, New planetary pressures indicate that money is likely to flow through your fingers like water. However, the situation is quite complex, and new funds will appear to replace those which have disappeared into the ether. As the cosmic law states, what goes round, comes round! READ | Ayodhya hearing — Verdict before CJI retires on Nov 17 
VIRGO, Think ahead and realise that the prospects of a shock, a surprise, or a complete turnaround at work, are increasing by the hour. It's difficult to be specific, but whatever is about to happen will affect your long-term security, hopefully for the better. 
LIBRA, The Moon is in a cautious zone of the zodiac, and I am sure that you will take your responsibilities seriously, but the reckless and self-indulgent consequences of tomorrow's solar battle are already stirring in the more enjoyable regions of your psyche. 
SCORPIO, For one who is supposed to be so private, all the current planetary pressures are urging you to live your life in public. Just as soon as you give the word, all the skeletons will come tumbling out of their cupboards. You'd better have a good story prepared! ALSO READ | On India's US tariff cut table: Bourbon whiskey to frozen chicken 
SAGITTARIUS, Family members are looking over your shoulder - and domestic spending moves up the agenda, but only temporarily. It therefore follows that if property deals, rental agreements or major investments are current, you should move fast to secure a favourable outcome. 
CAPRICORN, You should judge financial matters very carefully, and if you have any doubts about the wisdom of a particular purchase or investment, hold off until after the weekend. You may be feeling slightly vulnerable emotionally, so take the necessary safeguards. AQUARIUS Lunar alignments expose you to exploitation by others, and it may indeed be right for you to perform a few favours. Yet, you would also be justified in being a little selfish and putting up your defences against people who just don't know where to stop.

GEMINI, If you have ever wondered why other people are so very strange, but have been unable to find the answer, you may have been looking in the wrong place. Your planets now suggest that the answer lies with you as much as with anyone else. Perhaps your actions have even had unintended consequences. CANCER Your finances have certainly seen some changes over the past few weeks, and there are more to come. You can now use your time to build up your personal funds for the future. Even in romantic affairs, much depends on what you can afford. Hopefully partners will be understanding. READ | Bid to malign… my integrity clear before God: SC judge 
LEO, The Moon commences a new relationship with your sign, so it's now a special time for Leos. You're therefore entering a cycle which favours personal resolutions for the future: do yourself a favour and make a wish! But will it come true? You'll never know unless you try! 
VIRGO, Friends and rivals agree over what needs to be done. Yet it is possible that what is now begun will be completed in a very different form from your current expectations. In love, take it easy and play it cool. Oh, and don't forget a promise you made some time ago. 
LIBRA, Your social life is about to be revived and reinvigorated in a rather surprising manner. You may be aware of new possibilities as early as tomorrow, but it may be as long as two weeks before the desired invitations arrive. Perhaps it's just that partners are impossibly slow. 
SCORPIO, One particular new situation at home should be discussed without delay. You are surprisingly good at getting practical talks going when you have to and, if you can knock some sense into a partner's head, you'll do them an enormous favour. There's no doubt about it! 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll soon spend a little extra time mulling over the financial situation. There are of course shopping trips to make, but such routine matters seem to be but the tip of an iceberg which at its depths touches all that is most fundamental in your life. 
CAPRICORN, Happily, the Moon is in a helpful position. You can afford to embark on the day's schedule with supreme confidence, but you will also have to be honest and upfront about your true feelings. Nobody will respect you if you attempt to pull the wool over their eyes. READ | Back at Eden, Sourav Ganguly talks cricket AQUARIUS No matter how hard other people try, don't let them prise any secrets out of you. And, if you have any spare time, do spend a few moments by yourself in quiet contemplation, free from the responsibilities and distractions of the modern age. You need to work out exactly what you really think. 
GEMINI, Read weekly horoscope  The forecast over the next two months is very much in favour of domestic improvements, decorations and the like. But please do plan ahead and don't be fazed by temporary setbacks - it's all part of the cosmic plan. Even a temporary diversion may carry you into new areas of opportunity. CANCER The Sun adjusts its position and planetary relationships, so this is an appropriate time to pause for thought, reflect on the past and meditate on the future. On the material plane, renewed extravagance is on the way. That's why you'd better check up on your bank balance. 
LEO, It is becoming increasingly important that you get your point across - but how? You can charm people if necessary and, if you are so minded, you may bully them just a little. But there's still something missing, so you might wish to delay important announcements just a little longer. 
VIRGO, Astrologers all agree that you tend to keep your feelings to yourself, yet there are times when you can hang loose and be every bit as wild and emotional as anyone else. This is a great time for unrestrained passion, so let rip - within reason, of course! 
LIBRA, Just to turn our attention to the romantic sphere for a moment, it looks very much as if you are keeping certain feelings to yourself. This may be a wise move! However, full and free discussion is absolutely vital in all ordinary domestic arrangements. 
SCORPIO, The intuitive Scorpio will be thinking ahead and formulating long-range plans. But don't be too concerned by details, and do make a point of broadening your horizons. Late afternoon is best for an important professional choice, perhaps because it will take you that long to wake up! 
SAGITTARIUS, Unexpected circumstances offer you a chance to turn the tables on any situation - or on an individual who has been bugging you. Emotional tensions are rarely far below the surface and you can never tell when a partner will explode. It's best to tread carefully! 
CAPRICORN, You may have had a financial shock recently, but don't panic. The relevant planetary symbolism indicates the necessity of a brief crisis before you can abandon the habits of a lifetime and embark on a new prosperous cycle. It could well be a loved one who comes forward with the best advice. AQUARIUS It's a fine time to consider new financial partnerships, even if only over some rather small joint purchase. If you're considering investments, how about something artistic or just plain self-indulgent? And if you're pursuing romantic dreams, don't count the cost. 
GEMINI, Good communication is of the essence. Over the next few days you must say what needs to be said. You should have got something important off your chest by now, but there are still one or two hidden resentments. These, though, can be left until later. CANCER The Sun is now preparing to reduce its romantic presence, a poetic indication that you must draw the veil over several difficult situations, and make sure that a number of promising opportunities are of lasting value. Hang on to the past by all means, but not on to people and places that are no good for you. 
LEO, Sometimes planetary cycles just refuse to be convenient. Your stars are out of tune with the working week, and ideally you should extend your personal activities until Wednesday, at least. However, if there is serious business to conduct today, make sure you concentrate on the financial aspects. 
VIRGO, Secrets are all very well, but the fact that you're still not letting on about something important could eventually cause a spot of aggravation. You must pick your time carefully - next week might bring the best moment to reveal all. Can you wait? I think so! 
LIBRA, Like many other people, your mood will change on Wednesday and Thursday. So, if you have social arrangements to confirm, do so as soon as possible, mainly because by the end of the week partners will be showing an increasing tendency to misunderstand the simplest instruction. 
SCORPIO, There's still a lot to happen at work, and you are by no means at the end of a period of professional adjustment. A complete change of direction is likely for many Scorpios, and even if you're not in paid employment, a major long-term ambition is about to crystallize. 
SAGITTARIUS, The Moon is in an intense relationship with your sign, an indication that while you may be a little more emotional than usual, you have the advantage in most dealings with other people, both at work and at home. You must use your talents and energy wisely. 
CAPRICORN, If financial decisions are pending, don't mess around or prevaricate. There is a great deal to be gained from exerting your monetary muscle to get your own way. Dazzle people with the facts, and you may just find that they come round to your way of thinking. AQUARIUS You'll have to clarify the issues in all personal relationships now. Although you are about to enter a phase in which the emotional situation should be generally satisfying, you'll be guided by your instincts and hence liable to make one or two false moves. 
GEMINI, Astrology is all about making your own decisions, not about letting other people make your choices for you. Right now you have the option as to whether to enjoy yourself in an endless round of parties or achieve something that is truly individual and inspired. Also, as far as professional contacts are concerned, you might do best to be as diplomatic as you can. CANCER Family decisions are imminent, but this week's discussions may be undermined by the rapid pace of events. Some Cancerians are even gearing up for a move of home or, at least, they're dreaming of life elsewhere. But the time for drastic action may well be over, at least for now. Before long someone is going to remind you of a debt of honour. 
LEO, Venus' intriguing relationship with generous Jupiter is prosperous, affectionate and determined to make the most of life. All your past efforts are about to be rewarded. You should take a fresh look at a romantic contact, and emotional first-aid might be necessary if you're in danger of falling-out. Take refuge in work if you like: it may be fun to engage with wider ambitions. 
VIRGO, The ancients regarded Venus and Jupiter as the most benevolent of all the planets, and Saturn as the strictest. You can get the best out of all these planets by working hard, taking care of every single, tiny detail, yet always keeping an eye on the main chance. You may even soon be set up for a bout of good fortune, if not exactly fame. 
LIBRA, Your lunar alignments are a mixed bag, there's no doubt about that! By ancient tradition this is an auspicious time, but one when you may rest and take stock, at least until Wednesday or Thursday. Only once in a while are your financial stars so significant, so tread carefully. You can make subtle decisions that set you up for future prosperity. 
SCORPIO, The current crop of planetary aspects is pushing you in two directions. One set is making you more sociable, the other is driving you into your Scorpionic hole, turning you into a hermit. Which will win? Whichever pressure triumphs, there will be a romantic twist, and quite possibly a surprise visitor. Unexpected developments will be welcome, so keep an open space in your diary. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's not a question of what you know but who you know so, with all your naive and enthusiastic charm, you should be at a considerable advantage. Professional Sagittarians are basking under superb stars, so now is the time to act if you wish to change jobs: your first step is to get the information sorted out. At long last, you might say! 
CAPRICORN, You are still very much in command of the situation, though you are showing a tendency to abdicate responsibility and allow fate to step in. Complacency is your main foe in private and public affairs. A new emotional bond will soon be strengthened, with happy consequences all round. You might even bring the smile back to someone's lips. AQUARIUS Whatever else is happening in your chart, whatever the ups and downs in your life, nothing matters except the profound strength that you are about to gather from Saturn's stabilising and serious presence. Plus, if you have any doubts about a financial venture, check the legal situation. You might discover something to your advantage. 
GEMINI, Short journeys beckon, so you may accept any invitations that take you away from home. Mind you, they are as likely to be for business as for pleasure. If you are waiting for someone to get in touch, wait no longer. Take the initiative, make the first move and never doubt yourself. CANCER You may feel the need to be a little more secretive than usual, yet without being deceptive or manipulative. Your romantic stars are at a height, and even the slightest change will find you feeling much more sensitive. Still, it's good to be in touch with your emotions.

LEO, This is certain to be a time of emotional ups and downs, with an emphasis on the ups. However, only determined action will shift a log-jam to do with work, or resolve deep-rooted irritations at home. First of all, though, you need to work out what partners really want. 
VIRGO, Dream on. Your imagination should be at its peak, which means that there could be extra worries, but that you should also emphasise all the positive angles in your life at the moment. Concentrate on the ethical issues, and raise moral standards all round. 
LIBRA, Some sort of financial crisis is looming, so fancy footwork will be necessary if you want to avoid bad feeling and save yourself some of your hard-earned cash. If you're in the housing market, or otherwise contemplating large domestic purchases, follow a hunch.

SCORPIO, Watch out for emotional squalls and be aware of the extent to which you may be responsible for any ructions. This doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong, but there may be things which you have left undone which, in their turn, have left someone else high and dry. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your imagination may lead you a merry old dance, and feelings like resentment, jealousy, anger and the desire for revenge are lurking. However, first you should make a fair and reasonable assessment of the situation. Let the facts speak for themselves. 
CAPRICORN, Seldom have your stars looked more passionate - at least not for a month or so! Such feelings will of course have intense repercussions for your romantic affairs, but will also influence other areas of your life. Adopt a bold and colourful approach. Read | Bengal on boil over killings, family says no link to any Parivar, only ours AQUARIUS You are much stronger than you think, and even apparently disastrous developments will turn out in your favour. You must pay special attention to partners who are swept away by feelings they can't understand - and don't tangle with authority, either! 
GEMINI, At work and at home you must keep the talking going, aware of the need for agreement. At the very least you must make sure that loved ones know your views on a promised gathering or engagement. If you explain yourself, then they can't pretend they didn't understand you! CANCER It's time to get out and indulge in a spot of shopping therapy, hopefully today, but tomorrow will do if you really are tied up just now. There's nothing like spending a bit of money on an overdue treat to lift your morale. But, then, you still need a long-term solution, so don't imagine that you're off the hook! 
LEO, You are bathed in beneficial lunar alignments, and these are bound to make you feel increasingly emotional - and more compassionate. You may also be a little gullible, and hence a soft touch for some! So, keep a weather-eye open for roving confidence tricksters. 
VIRGO, You do tend to worry, and sometimes you wonder if you've backed the wrong horse. However, right now you should allow yourself a great deal of extra time to consider the options and give current developments time to work themselves out before taking rash decisions. 
LIBRA, Your social stars are beginning to look more buoyant, and you should keep your eyes open for new friends and fascinating meetings. Where romance is concerned, it looks very much as if security is increasingly the main issue. You want to hang on to what you have. 
SCORPIO, Strident planetary aspects force you to choose between home and work, between family interests and outside ambitions. Once you have made your position clear, others should give you the freedom to go your own way. But is freedom really what you want? You won't know unless you've got it! 
SAGITTARIUS, Let the past take care of itself and concentrate on the untried and untested solutions of the future. It will do you a power of good to improve conditions at work, spreading a bit of colour around and generally raising the quality of life. And while you're at it, why don't you reassure people you live with that you're right behind them? 
CAPRICORN, Perhaps long-term financial commitments and obligations are causing concern, but you will have to understand that partners may not share your outlook. Relax and trust a little more in the healing power of time. It's strange how what is so important today can be completely forgotten tomorrow. AQUARIUS It's a fairly stressful day, but by no means a bad one. Much depends on how far you are prepared to welcome change, and to what extent you can turn friction to your advantage. It may be a cliche, but do look on the bright side, won't you? After all, optimism breeds success. 
GEMINI, You may be inclined to distance yourself from certain events in your past, and in the future you might concentrate more on schemes designed to broaden your horizons. The crucial factor, though, is how much you can really afford. The first step, then, is to count your cash.  Cancer There will definitely be a few emotional ups and downs today, and even the occasional misunderstanding, most likely around midday. Stay on your toes and keep an eye on the beneficial long-term pattern. And don't get too upset by people who pick up the wrong end of the stick. 
LEO, There could be a mystery to solve, perhaps a lost possession or mislaid instructions. There could even be an element of farce if other people fail to keep appointments or just generally miss the point. The best advice? Probably to hang on to your sense of humour. 
VIRGO, Once in a while you are given a moment to pause, to come up for air and take your bearings. This must be one such time, and if you can possibly work out exactly who is doing what, you'll get a very much better notion of your own future role and a good thing, too. 
LIBRA, Events which take place now could make you less inclined to count the cost of a relationship which may have lost its glitter. In other words, be thankful for what you have, and don't expect people to be things they're not. Sometimes happiness flows from appreciating what you've got. 
SCORPIO, There are no simple solutions. However, you can ensure that others take you at your word, and give you the necessary backing. The emotional situation at the moment could be rather fraught if you fail to notice that partners require ten times the normal dose of affection. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have learnt many harsh lessons in the past, but now you must learn the hardest of all - to trust other people. Fortunately, the emotional issues seem to be slight, so only practical matters need to be faced. Right now, partners will appreciate a businesslike approach. 
CAPRICORN, Your chart is like a maze, and it's all a question of finding your way to the heart of the matter. For reasons best known to yourself you appear to be caught between two emotional choices. These seem to relate to family members rather than friends or lovers, and the solutions are right under your nose. AQUARIUS An opportunity which materialises some time over the next few weeks could enable you to make a completely fresh start. The absolutely vital point now is to talk about all your plans, even at the risk of being thought silly. If partners don't understand you, that's their problem. 
GEMINI, For the next month or so you will be a walking social contradiction, apparently tremendously open and upfront but, in reality, keeping all your most important and intense feelings deeply hidden. However, consider this: if you want to communicate with loved ones you might have to be a little more direct. Cancer It's time to take control and insist that other people see things your way. This doesn't mean that you should ignore their interests, but it's about time you had a fair and unbiased hearing. Perhaps you should spend a little longer preparing your case.

LEO, Daydream to your heart's content, and don't let other people make you feel strange for wanting to spend time by yourself. At work, it's very much who you know rather than what you know that carries you through. There's nothing wrong in exploiting personal contacts — is there? 
VIRGO, Your social stars become stronger, which means that even at work it is personal relationships which count for the most. Look at the long-term, making every effort to broaden your horizons. Besides, there's a surprise just around the corner. Also Read | Explained: How plan for clean air works 
LIBRA, It's time to be more forthright about your ambitions, including professional aspirations. Also, bear in mind that you can no longer shrug off partners' desires, for there appear to be deeper issues at stake than you once thought. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you. 
SCORPIO, You may check out the legal situation, putting the emphasis on your own rights, but not forgetting your responsibilities. Don't let other people make the running when it comes to setting standards, for their view of what should and shouldn't be done is less rigorous than yours. Read | 65 days after lockdown, officials in Valley caution: Don't call this ‘normal' 
SAGITTARIUS, This is an adventurous moment, and you should know now that you can't be held back by social taboos which have lost their meaning. Your competitive instincts must be released if you are to come out on top. However, it's not so much a matter of finishing first, as of doing the best job. 
CAPRICORN, Partnership affairs are central to your life today, so you really should attempt to reach a compromise. Partners and colleagues may be muddled, or they may be unable to express themselves clearly, but that doesn't diminish the relevance of their message. AQUARIUS There's so much planetary activity in the lower reaches of your chart that maximum change must be expected at home. It could be about another twelve weeks before you're clear about what your part must be. People could be coming and going, but what you really need is security. 
GEMINI, This should be a somewhat sensitive day, but no less confident for that. The golden rule is never to take offence, and always to realise that little slights may be unintended. Partners really are in need of your care and understanding, so you'll have to be patient. CANCER You are undoubtedly well aware of certain emotional undercurrents, and it's thanks to your intuitive skills that you're more in tune than many other people with the choices that should now be faced. That doesn't mean that you'll come up with the right answers, though, so tread carefully. Also Read | Taliban free 3 Indian hostages in exchange for 11 of its leaders 
LEO, Don't expect any let-up of daily pressures in the long-term, even if today's stars are more relaxed than usual. You should realise that any tension can work to your advantage, giving you the excuse to make long-overdue improvements, especially at work. 
VIRGO, This is one occasion when partners may be better equipped to take control. At work employers should be listened to and obeyed, although they in their turn should recognise your role as a conciliator. It's all a matter of mutual respect - and of striking the right balance. Also Read | Time for India to lift restrictions in J&amp;K: US panel 
LIBRA, The best relationships, at the moment, are those based on joint interests, and the happiest social life is that built on good conversation. Consider the legal situation, and make sure that, above all else, you know your rights. And don't give anyone the wrong idea about your intentions. 
SCORPIO, The cycle you're now entering is one which warns you about the danger of burning yourself out, but offers you the chance to get your physical well-being together, cleaning up your diet, improving your exercise and tackling niggling chronic complaints. 
SAGITTARIUS, Partners and business associates will eventually reveal facts which you think you ought to know. However, when it comes to dealing with people in authority, extracting the truth may be like getting blood out of a stone. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't continue to try! Also Read | Second husband of Kerala ‘serial killer' questioned, politicians under scanner 
CAPRICORN, Areas of your life which are now being spotlighted indicate exactly where you should streamline your affairs and how you should reorganise your relationships. Consider any and all changes at home, no matter how radical. You never know - they might receive a warm welcome. AQUARIUS Circumstances beyond your control may now force you to abandon certain schemes, or at least reach a major compromise. Family plans are still in a state of some uncertainty, while domestic entertaining looks favourable. Take advantage of any opportunities for pleasure! 
GEMINI, You might have to come into the open, so have your story ready and make sure you're capable of making yourself understood. Throughout the day you should find that your self-esteem is restored, and that it's no longer necessary to take refuge in your daydreams. CANCER It's quite a good moment to keep yourself to yourself, to have time and space to listen to your imagination and conscience. You may even consider cancelling a social engagement. But before you take any precipitate action, realise that when the time comes, your feelings might have moved on. 
LEO, You may feel as if you are being forced to do something against your will or against your dignity. However, the best advice now is to press ahead and concentrate on making colleagues see your point of view. Gentle persuasion might work better than brute force. In fact, I'm sure it will! Opinion | Ahead of polls, BJP has rearranged Maharashtra's political field to its own advantage 
VIRGO, You will soon be afforded a splendid chance to travel to somewhere you've never been before. In any event, you'll do yourself a very big favour if you extend and develop all contacts with companions in distant parts and people from different cultures. 
LIBRA, Problems of a partnership or matrimonial nature ought now to be faced. You should find that once you talk about your concerns, they begin to disappear and your innate sense of well-being returns. An old expense is bugging you, but it's also time to collect a debt. Read | Five days to go, India awaits official word on Xi's visit 
SCORPIO, Much as you'd like to be the centre of attention, you still have no choice but to listen to other people, understand their feelings and try to satisfy their desires. Financial choices are now appearing, but there is no need for a final decision just yet. 
SAGITTARIUS, When dealing with finances and business or property matters, you should make a point of being as clear-headed as you can. Your heart tells you one thing, your wallet another, so seek expert advice. This is not a good time to give people the wrong idea about your intentions, so make sure you're not misunderstood. 
CAPRICORN, This looks like a busy day, and it's time to call on your more versatile talents. In view of emotional complications, it seems likely that you'll have to juggle different balls in the air at the same time. It may not be easy, especially if a friend or colleague backs out of a commitment. Read | Jovial, friendly, pious: Shocked Kerala town recalls its ‘serial killer' AQUARIUS Favourable planetary alignments are perfectly balanced by challenging ones, which means that you could have the best of both worlds. This should also be an ideal moment to put your plans into practice. Thought and action should go hand in hand, with your heart and your head leading you in the same direction. 
GEMINI, Life is getting busier by the day, and a good thing too! After all, the more active you are, the happier you may be. However free of commitments you are at the beginning of the week, by the end your responsibilities will be mounting. Can you bear to say ‘no'? Your financial prospects will improve but don't take facts at face value. CANCER As family and home ties temporarily weaken, you'll be free to indulge the restless, nomadic dimension of your character, a side of your life which is all too often ignored. Financially, you should be heading for a profit, for which your own good sense is largely responsible. Luck only plays a small part, and then because you have laid careful plans.

LEO, The future is at last becoming clearer and it looks certain that those of you with the most exciting lives will be the ones planning drastic, and quite possibly expensive, domestic reforms. So, if you feel that you're stuck in a rut, now is the time to act. Only when financial matters are settled will romantic matters become clear. 
VIRGO, The long-term cycle continues on its very promising path. Short-term monetary ventures may now be postponed or even cancelled, perhaps because new information is beginning to emerge from the woodwork. Some of you will be going away, but long journeys look to be more likely for business than pleasure. Expect professional pressures to ease towards the end of the week. 
LIBRA, A special time of year is continuing and, by the end of the week, almost all of you will have experienced highly promising solar transits. However, fate may take a back-seat and it's therefore up to you to think fast and seize the opportunities which float past, especially mid-week. Your social and professional stars look equally bright. 
SCORPIO, After a period when you've been happy to keep yourself to yourself, you can stay quiet no longer. Challenging circumstances and awkward customers will be determined to test your mettle. And after a brief interlude, you will revive a romantic connection, this time on a more friendly footing. You can rely on others to cheer you up. Idea Exchange: ‘How does Article 370 affect common man in Haryana?' 
SAGITTARIUS, There's no change in the generally ambitious disposition of your stars, but stay-at-home types may miss out. You'll be entrusted with secret information and may be keeping a low profile. Professional Sagittarians will discover a crock of gold at the end of a very profitable rainbow, but not for about another three weeks. 
CAPRICORN, Worldly ambitions will no longer seem to be so important by the end of the week. Perhaps a friend or relation who has been causing a fuss will settle down and offer you their support instead. It will be the larger picture which grabs you, together with the feeling that friends you've ignored need a little attention. Your timing will have to be perfect. AQUARIUS In many ways your stars are stunning, but if you're passing through a lazy phase you'd better watch out! Only those of you with one hundred and one percent determination and willpower will win through. If you're lacking experience, stay out of the running. Oh, a generous gift should help you get your way. 
GEMINI, Auspicious planetary aspects are not entirely absent, but they are rather rare. This is a busy time, but I hope you'll manage to take the weight off your feet and pamper yourself a little. You will gain credibility by actually doing what you say you're going to do. CANCER You are well able to make up your own mind, and there is no point in advising you to disregard what is now taking place on the emotional front. I can only urge you to give others the benefit of the doubt and steer events from conflict to pleasure. Also read | ‘Tax chief told me to drop sensitive case, said he was secure after acting against Opp leader' 
LEO, No doubt you would prefer to do things in a direct and open manner, but this might not be possible. You may be obliged to keep certain things to yourself. Domestic considerations predominate and a relative, perhaps a child, will need your help. 
VIRGO, It's another of those tough days, but once midday has been and gone, you'll begin to get a much clearer picture of where you're coming from, where you're heading and what you'll do when you get there! The clues lie in the little, apparently trivial and meaningless events. 
LIBRA, The whole mood of the day changes around noon, and it looks as if you may begin to feel less sociable and more inclined to tuck yourself away. Everybody needs to hibernate occasionally, and I'd recommend a spot of seclusion: make time for yourself for a change. Follow live updates on the Aarey tree-felling protests in Mumbai 
SCORPIO, There has to be a breakthrough in matrimonial and partnership matters. You're not alone and you will face up to the reality of your relationships and the obligations and ties they create. Partners have needs and desires, some of which you have actively encouraged. 
SAGITTARIUS, Earlier in the day is possibly easier than later, the reason being that while you may be quite relaxed at the beginning, as the hours pass, you will be reminded of certain conditions essential to your survival. For one thing you need a partner's goodwill. 
CAPRICORN, Deal with money matters early on: if you're bargain-hunting, morning is the best time for a foray to the shops. Afternoon stars suggest adventurous options, overseas contacts and long-distance trips. A close partner will offer unexpected support - but expect something in return. AQUARIUS A high proportion of you will be doing a spot of over-time or extra work today. All members of your sign are in an ambitious mood and will be pursuing community activities or private hobbies. Deal with partners this morning and sort out cash this afternoon.

GEMINI, Remarkable opportunities to enhance your reputation are still in the air, although you may have more trouble bringing them to fulfilment. The key to the present time is never to force delicate issues. Instead you should wait until partners are ready to speak. CANCER There will be a time when you will be able to look back on current developments and laugh. In fact, you would do yourself some good if you could smile at whatever is happening now. A good sense of humour could save your life! And it will certainly save you money! 
LEO, Not everything has been revealed. Although you may say that you have come to terms with alterations and personal adjustments, I doubt whether you are in possession of the full facts. At this stage of the week you deserve a good break, but you may have to wait a little longer. Read | No problem with NRC, I had a talk with PM Modi in New York: Sheikh Hasina 
VIRGO, On no account should you get involved in any sort of intrigue, especially if it means going behind a relation's back. It must be stressed that this is not a time to settle old scores, not unless you are prepared to take on much more than you can handle. 
LIBRA, You seem to go to pieces when your emotional life becomes complicated, but it will help to consider the issues carefully and logically. For a start, you could seriously consider the virtues of boosting your self-confidence in countless little ways. 
SCORPIO, Yet another tough planetary alignment is on its way, so the emotional temperature is likely to remain high. Still, perhaps you prefer it like that. Remember that your sign has powerful healing qualities, which means that you can bring peace where before there was war. Also read | Manmohan to attend our event on Kartarpur, not Pak's: Punjab CM 
SAGITTARIUS, Planetary influences indicate that you are still experiencing uncertainty; but look deeper and you'll see that your spiritual and mystical self is stirring. It's time to renew your quest for personal meaning, looking within for the answers to questions you've always ignored. 
CAPRICORN, It's not difficult for you to cut a dash. You may be inclined to complain about your lot but, to be perfectly honest, the amount you have gone through over the past few years has given you more maturity than you may recognise. Perhaps other people should listen to you for a change. Read | Five SC judges recuse in Navlakha case, no reason is given AQUARIUS There is probably no let-up in the arguments over joint financial arrangements, but it is useful to clear the air. Career changes are looking very auspicious, so do press ahead. It seems likely that an old social contact may provide the quickest route to a new job or responsibility. 
GEMINI, It's not always easy to get your head around the facts, but you will have to do your sums and get the figures right. You'll also have to talk to other people about your plans. Short journeys are likely, as are unexpected visits, communications and calls. Also Read | J&amp;K: Curbs eased on movement of Jammu leaders, Valley waits CANCER You can make a fresh start, cleaning the debris out of your emotional life. Not for a very long time have you been advised to cut the bonds that have bound you so tightly. You may, if you wish, ease your way out of a burdensome responsibility or obligation you have come to regret. 
LEO, Hopefully you have already decided to alter course and opt out of a long-term commitment. However, nature abhors a vacuum, and new ties will step in to fill the gap left by the old. Exciting times lie ahead, and by this time next month you'll be ready to say farewell to old obligations. Also Read | FATF in mind, Ajit Doval makes trip to Saudi, meets MBS 
VIRGO, As you may already have found out, you have to face up to some extremely harsh situations. I am sorry if you're under a lot of strain at the moment, but never was the old advice more true: a problem shared is a problem halved. It may even be quartered! 
LIBRA, No amount of cash will compensate for a certain emotional lack. Yet it may well be useful to spend your way out of a tight situation. Don't be afraid of other people thinking that you are flashy. That is their problem. You must get on and do what you must do! 
SCORPIO, You know just how incredibly touchy other people can be. However, there's no point in ignoring the fact, for if you tread on their toes they'll only make your life a misery in return! Your best move is to indulge partners' little whims - just for a while. Also Read | Haryana's Hisar candidate gets surprise in husband's village: Remove purdah 
SAGITTARIUS, You may not take kindly to being told to wait your turn, yet that is precisely what you may have to do. A little self-sacrificing activity will do your spirit good, so put others first. Also, how about taking some time off to recharge your batteries? It could be a better idea than you think. 
CAPRICORN, It's well-known that you like a challenge. However, you probably wonder if you have set yourself an impossible task, and the stars confirm that you probably have. However, if you strive for the very best that you can manage, the results are bound to be worth the effort. AQUARIUS Although new commitments are on the cards, they may well not be binding. There are further developments which are yet to take place, and more information yet to come. Also, busy times are imminent, so stay ahead of the game at work. Also, if social plans are on the boil, let other people in on the secret. 
GEMINI, Each and every planetary movement is exerting a subtle effect on your entire consciousness. Mars, for example, is pulling the carpet from under your feet. Saturn is encouraging you to pause for thought. It's therefore time to give controversial projects a break. CANCER You're in quite a strong situation for once. Current planetary influences strengthen your position; a useful factor considering the generally petulant and combative state of the heavens. There is no reason to expect other people to share your beliefs, by the way. Opinion | How the Gandhian idea of non-violence is shaping a political struggle in Spain 
LEO, Venus advocates domestic entertaining and family harmony, but Pluto has other ideas. Watch any tendency to push people to the limit, or to stretch yourself too far for that matter. It will only be possible to go to extremes if you take the necessary safeguards. 
VIRGO, It's an idealistic moment, one when everything centres on your most deeply-held principles. And to continue one Virgoan theme, it is extremely likely that you're going to get involved in a worthwhile charitable activity. I can see many of you rattling those collecting tins. 
LIBRA, You can spare a little extra time for work and other worldly ambitions at the moment. Play your cards right over the next forty-eight hours and cash rewards could be your ultimate prize. Take each step as it comes, and pause to think again as soon as you feel that doubts are emerging. Opinion | For too many Gandhians, Gandhism is only a facade or a tactic 
SCORPIO, Although you appear to be caught in the crossfire at the moment, you may bring agreement to troubled quarters. No doubt you are annoyed by others' tendency to disagree, but there's no urgency for you to get involved. Neither is there any reason to clear up other people's mess! 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything that I've said about your financial situation should now be coming to a head. Today is the perfect time to deal with money, whether you're shifting millions of pounds from one continent to another, or merely after a bargain at the corner shop. Opinion | Gandhiji never left us, we left him. He is with us, but are we with him? 
CAPRICORN, Do take notice of what partners have to say today. Even if they are apparently not making sense, their assorted statements will be relevant to the somewhat strained mood of the times. Next week should be more relaxed! Until then, keep an eye on wayward children. AQUARIUS Although you appear to have gone way over the top lately, there is a case to be made for partners to be grateful. After all, others should thank you for shaking them up and making them look at their lives anew. As it happens, it's also a perfect moment for keeping fit. 
GEMINI, You can relax your efforts and allow others to do the arguing. No one has worked harder than you to keep the peace but now you deserve a little time to yourself. It is a fine moment to look after number one. After all, if you don't treat yourself well you won't treat anyone else properly, either. CANCER The combined influences of those mighty planets, Saturn and Jupiter, are about to work another major change in your private affairs. You're probably sick of hearing that your life's about to be transformed, but you've also probably become blase‚ about upheavals that knock others for six. 
LEO, Somebody has made all the right moves, but whether this is enough to placate you or make you change your ways is another matter. You are in a stubborn mood, but only you can decide whether you should stay as you are or bend a little. Perhaps you could do both!

VIRGO, The good news is that if you take a path of quiet meditation, devoted self-sacrifice and compromise, life will turn a very important corner and you'll end up with enhanced self-knowledge and understanding. And if you figure out your underlying motives then you'll make the right decisions. 
LIBRA, Although it may be an indirect approach which matters, you may be more impressed by a direct appeal for help. The point I am trying to make is that you are quite touchy and will respond irrationally to the precise manner in which others say and do things. 
SCORPIO, If you're sensible you'll consider eating humble pie, impressing others with your amazing contrition. You have much to be vain about, but overweening arrogance could cost you your happiness. If you're too complacent then you might just miss the most important developments. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's not the easiest thing in the world to come to grips with your solar chart at the moment. I am concerned that you may feel victimised or martyred. If so, please try and see what led you to this situation. Then you'll figure out how to get back to the way you were. 
CAPRICORN, Current planetary aspects will force you to accept that you have never made the most of your potential in certain ways. For example, have you ever truly shown the world the person you really are? I suspect that you haven't - but it's never too late to start. AQUARIUS Isn't it better to stand on your own two feet? There is a definite need to look to your laurels now and not imagine that other people are going to bail you out. Close partners feel quite rightly that you must dig yourself out of whatever hole you have put yourself in. 
GEMINI, Lunar alignments afford you considerable protection, but are also inclined to make you a little over-emotional. As soon as things begin to go wrong, you'll tend to panic. Stop and take a deep breath, count to ten and look around for the nearest escape hatch! CANCER Sometimes you swing to extremes, and it's very difficult for anyone else to know which course you're following at any particular time. It is also often said that love and hate are two sides of the same coin. I cannot tell which way you will jump this week, but I can say that passions will be running high. Let us hope that love will triumph. 
LEO, Optimism is your greatest asset. Utterly unrealistic expectations, on the other hand, are not only your major handicap, but are all too likely to be dashed. You may not wish to believe it, but your sign is one of the most fortunate in the zodiac at the moment. 
VIRGO, I'll get the bad news out of the way first: you are liable to feel let down when somebody seems to disagree with you. The good news is that you're in with a high chance of getting your story straight and your act together. A rival may even admit that you're right after all! 
LIBRA, Financial affairs hold the key to everything this week, whether purely personal or public and professional. If at all possible, do avoid all reckless and impulsive actions. These can only cost you dear. You might also be wondering whether an emotional tie is worth the price. 
SCORPIO, You can expect fireworks this week. That's not a joke. There really is a strong chance that someone is going to go over the top. Make sure it's not you, and that you are on hand with soothing words. That is the least that a loved one expects, especially after all you've said in the past. 
SAGITTARIUS, You must bear in mind that nothing this week will be easy to understand. Mysteries abound and confusion will be rife, but if you can hang on until next week you'll begin to see where it is all heading. Actually, the chances of reaching a firm agreement are better than you think. 
CAPRICORN, You need extra support, but it is honestly impossible to say whether it will be forthcoming. What others expect or imagine can only help you get to grips with your own affairs. You see, this is a deeply sociable time and whatever you do, whatever you say, everything hinges on your personal relationships. AQUARIUS Jealousy, resentment and animosity are your enemies. If you give in to such feelings, you will risk all that you have so carefully built up. Professional people are now in a delicate position, perhaps because they will expose themselves to criticism. 
GEMINI, You may need to work hard if you are to persuade other people to fall in with your plans. Don't worry if you can't secure the co-operation you need as there's nothing to be lost in going it alone. Venus is keeping your social stars buoyant, so get out and about mid-week. Stay in touch with older relations. They seem to have their finger on the pulse of family affairs. CANCER The two planets influencing your financial affairs are Venus and Mars, which explains why, although you stand a good chance of boosting your earnings, the most likely result will be an increase in your outgoings. Make the most of increasingly happy social stars, and take the initiative, rather than sitting by the phone, waiting to be asked. 
LEO, You're more dependent on partners than you sometimes admit. The appreciation and respect of your friends is vital to sustain your sense of emotional well-being. Such attention should be in plentiful supply this week, thanks to the affectionate planet, Venus. Now that Mercury is also being so helpful, you must listen to other people's good advice. 
VIRGO, Work may be hard but it should also be enjoyable, perhaps throwing up a new friendship. If you have any practical interests which seem to have been stalled, do team up with like-minded people. The whole point about current developments is that one or two minor crises now may be necessary in order to push you on to the next stage. 
LIBRA, Venus is a superb planet, occupying as it does a central position in your astrological make-up. Its current location signifies that whatever troubles you encounter, you'll always bounce back. Saturn is still advising caution, so you'd be advised to tread carefully in personal matters. After all, you have no intention of upsetting someone you rely upon. 
SCORPIO, A happy atmosphere at home may be knocked off course by a personal surprise. The fact is that partners and loved ones will be so enthusiastic about their own plans that they may be unwilling to compromise. So, you could make it your goal to bring everyone together. Mars tends to push you into various madcap schemes, but this is no time to leap without looking. 
SAGITTARIUS, The combined movement of the Sun and Mercury is due to take the heat off at home and allow you more space for your own personal needs. You really must try to get out and about as much as you can. Jupiter, your ruler, has more surprises in store within a few weeks, so plan your hoped-for improvements now. 
CAPRICORN, The emphasis is shifting to your home life and it now seems that long-term plans may finally come to fruition. Indeed, there is every chance that events will now move towards a speedy and satisfactory conclusion. Pay more attention to financial affairs - there are healthy profits to be made if you spot the right opportunities. AQUARIUS It's a lively time for Aquarians, mainly on an intimate, personal level. The pressure on your finances should ease, which is one reason why you may now contemplate new purchases. You can act in the knowledge that the fates are with you, although you can never be totally sure what twists and turns await you. 
GEMINI, An intimate relationship still looks a little costly, but your generous instincts may persuade people that their feelings are genuine. Even if you have planned a relaxing break, you may be very preoccupied with professional hopes and achievements, on a partner's behalf if not on your account. There may be little or nothing you can do about it just yet, though. CANCER It's full steam ahead for all of you whose ambitions lie in the educational sphere, overseas activities or legal questions. You can expect temporary obstacles at work, but as far as we can see they'll be easily overcome. You might have to apply a little extra charm, though.

LEO, Loved ones or close companions may advise caution and restraint, but they might be taking completely different considerations into account from those which preoccupy you. As usual, the cost is the determining factor, so you'll have to count your cash very carefully. 
VIRGO, Try to exercise patience and consideration in all your dealings with close partners. They are liable to fly off the handle if you put a foot wrong  and, probably, if you don't! Never was patience so utterly, totally necessary: wait your turn! Also read | Karnataka probe: Seer's phone was tapped by passing him off as smuggler 
LIBRA, You now run the risk of missing out on exciting developments at work or at home by deliberating too much on matters of detail. On the other hand, there is no way to rush ahead until the groundwork is properly laid: perhaps it's time to bring family members in. 
SCORPIO, Planetary activity, focusing on energetic and potentially ambitious regions of your chart, brings a long-standing dispute over routine chores to ahead. But don't let arguments over who does what ruin your day, for when it comes down to it, everyone has a role - including you. 
SAGITTARIUS, Although you may be receiving a lot of sympathy and support from certain close associates, nobody can do your job for you. This is why you must now put your shoulder to the wheel and sort out your domestic situation. After all, if you're not happy at home then the rest of your life will suffer. READ | INX Media net widens: Ex-Niti Aayog CEO among 4 to be prosecuted 
CAPRICORN, Steel yourself for a clash of temperament but set your sights on smoother times and maybe do a little more than your share of the chores. You must remember that the wise person rules their stars, while only the fool obeys them, and so the more responsibility you accept, the better off you'll be. AQUARIUS Nobody can really say that you have your feet on the ground - least of all you! Yet your understanding of people's deeper motives is second to none, and this is why you find it so easy to analyse the problems, if not to resolve them. One thing is clear though - that you'll be tempted to solve difficulties by throwing money at them. 
GEMINI, The tide of fortune at work is about to turn. Yet you must now be even more alert if you are to shape events to your will. Today, you may have to sit back, leaving other people to deal with their problems. After all, there is a limit to what even you can accomplish! CANCER Carelessness could be a problem, so watch out if you're travelling: you really must confirm all instructions and arrangements before setting out. Also, don't compromise your principles because, if you do, then you might gain a short-term advantage at the cost of a long-term loss of respect.

LEO, This is certain to be an action-packed day, the culmination of all the last month's developments. However, the main issue for you still revolves around your financial commitments. Perhaps it is now time to call a halt to excess spending, or at least to get someone else to chip in! 
VIRGO, Don't get too hot under the collar if partners and colleagues refuse to co-operate or decide not to endorse certain schemes. Your pet projects will survive with or without other people's help. What you need to do is deal with someone who seems determined to get in your way - perhaps by explaining what you're really up to. 
LIBRA, The overall picture as far as professional interests are concerned is now likely to become more acute. In addition, you may begin to be concerned that too much stress and strain is wearing you down physically. The answer is simple - take a little extra rest and relaxation. And soon!

SCORPIO, You may be close to finding your heart's desire. Or, at least, you may be closer to establishing what exactly it is that you want and why you are attracted to some people more than others. That's excellent news, for if you understand your motives then you'll be able to streamline your affairs. 
SAGITTARIUS, In spite of a series of challenging planetary aspects which denote uncertainty at home, you will be able to overcome any adverse consequences through the simple expedient of careful planning. That, though, is an exercise you'll probably need some help with! 
CAPRICORN, Believe it or not, there is a silver lining behind today's clouds. Not until the dust has settled will you see just how fortunate you are. Please do not be put off by other people's apparent inability to comprehend your plans or understand your intentions. Read | Government has revived National Population Register project. What is it? AQUARIUS You have to travel along unknown paths and venture into new emotional terrain before you discover the secret to who you are and where you're going. In the meantime, try and maintain good relationships with people who, after all, have always stood by you. 
GEMINI, Try to think of possession or personal contact you are losing as something that you might be better off without. You know better than anyone that your future happiness depends more than anything on a change of attitude. Strangely, it would probably also do partners good if you alter your opinions. CANCER In spite of the many obstacles that circumstances are placing in your path, the long-term plan is still working in your favour. Never imagine that you are powerless in the face of fate. You're not, and if there's anything astrology can teach you, then it's how to create your own future. READ | Modi reaches out to US investors: Come to India, will personally act as a bridge 
LEO, Don't expect business affairs to go exactly according to plan. On the other hand, there is really no need to worry about short-term hiccups turning into long-term catastrophes - just as long as you keep your finger on the pulse. That way you'll be prepared for the unexpected. 
VIRGO, Sure you have your shy side, but anyone who still believes that you are always timid is about to be put firmly in their place. However, over the next three days you can expect to meet considerably more opposition than for many weeks, so take a positive approach and listen to good advice. 
LIBRA, Concern about a personal matter is due to increase over the next forty-eight hours, but this is all to the good if it alerts you to possible weaknesses. Put your time to good account by cleaning up your diet, improving your exercise and devoting more attention to your responsibilities. ALSO READ | George Kurian: ‘Love jihad on in Kerala, conversion into terror, not Islam' 
SCORPIO, There's a minor planetary cycle at work that affects your sign and which comes to a head over the coming two or three days. The opportunities which now open up should be profoundly creative in the broadest sense and could, eventually, lead to a life which is so much more satisfying. 
SAGITTARIUS, People at home will be gearing up for a fight. This is one of those disputes in which nothing of substance seems to be involved beyond a feeling that someone's pride has been hurt. But, then, it's what exactly people feel that counts, and that's why they need to be placated. 
CAPRICORN, It may be wise to wait another few days before pressurising anybody else into a firm commitment. The fact is that close partners may feel much more strongly about your ideas than you realised. You should probably spend a little extra effort on gentle persuasion. READ | CBI officer who led investigation in Rakesh Asthana case seeks voluntary retirement AQUARIUS You're in a generally prosperous phase, but as soon as you stop concentrating, costs could shoot up. All that happens financially from now until the weekend may not be entire to your liking. This is one of those times when you have to accept that the planets could be pushing you in a new direction. 
GEMINI, A series of reassuring aspects to your favourite planets will only be effective if you take steps to put all your plans and intentions on a sound practical basis. There is no room for waffle, perhaps because people out there are relying on you to show what you're made of. CANCER You are benefiting from a striking relationship with expansive, optimistic Jupiter and generous gestures will do you good in the long run. One thing you can do for yourself at the moment is to find unusual solutions to old and familiar problems. You never know - it might just work! 
LEO, Your life is so often a question of keeping up with the neighbours, rather than of making real substantial improvements in your affairs based on what is good for you. You may now be realising that such a course can involve you in unexpected costs and that perhaps you have needs which you've ignored for too long. 
VIRGO, Life is often so serious and sober, yet it's open to you to follow sudden impulses if you wish, however ridiculous or child-like they may be. All similarly-minded spirits and soul-mates will support you in your endeavours, so surround yourself with people who are on your wavelength. 
LIBRA, It must be so strange when your plans work out in unexpected ways. Yet nothing in astrology happens without a reason, and you must see that over the next few weeks you will be given a chance to change your direction. Whether you seize opportunities now or wait until they come round again, is up to you, so choose wisely. 
SCORPIO, Stay cool. Don't over-react or over-dramatise your emotional problems just because you feel that you have been hard-done-by in the past. You should reflect deeply on all your complaints before unjustly accusing your fellows because, if it turns out that you're wrong, you'll never forgive yourself! 
SAGITTARIUS, The fact that planetary activity is so much less intense than in the past should allow you to relax. But please keep an eye on apparently trivial complaints at home which could flare up without warning. If someone close by is bothered by secret fears, then offer whatever support you can. 
CAPRICORN, You've had it relatively easy in your professional life over recent weeks, while those of you with worldly ambitions have found them simple to fulfil. Yet now you may have to go into reverse gear once again. An added twist comes when you either work with a friend - or become attracted to a colleague. AQUARIUS The time has, at last, come to deepen your knowledge and improve your wisdom through a little careful thought and inquiry. At work, you will now begin to benefit from improved friendships. And, in an intimate relationship, you spot an opportunity to line your pocket! 
GEMINI, After today, romantic arrangements may begin to come unstuck, perhaps because friends start standing up for themselves. In some cases, this may be a relief, while in others you will be offered plenty of opportunities to correct any misunderstandings. CANCER You will now be seeing that there is much to be gained from taking a creative approach, developing your individual talents, rejecting pointless social constraints and letting your special form of spontaneity flow. You're also hitting an adventurous phase, by the way, so you'll soon be considering options and alternatives that you never thought were for you. 
LEO, What can you do when the stars indicate that you're still in a costly phase? Probably no more than paying up when the bills come rolling in. However, you should have taken steps by now to boost your earnings. Also, if a relationship still seems like an uphill struggle, then give it a few more weeks before you decide to get fed up! 
VIRGO, You can now afford to look forward to a rest, even though there'll be moments when you feel as if you are still rushing along at breakneck speed, sweeping all lesser mortals and beings aside. However, it seems to be the case that much of your energy actually comes from other people - and perhaps from a new partnership. 
LIBRA, The Moon will cheer you up, especially when it forms some very helpful celestial relationships to parts of your chart which stimulate your vivid imagination. If all goes according to plan, this could be the time when you hear some welcome and very overdue news. 
SCORPIO, You may leave more stressful issues until tomorrow and concentrate on home and family arrangements. It's an ideal moment for discussing plans and finalising agreements, especially if money is on your mind, and particularly if you're prepared for the unknown! 
SAGITTARIUS, Events that take place at the end of the week should clear away a lot of the debris, emotional and otherwise, at home. Until then, press ahead with whatever ambitious professional projects are in the pipeline - and make sure that everyone who needs to know what you're up to, does know. 
CAPRICORN, Pull every string you can if you want to sustain your position at work or in the community. You may, though, be obliged to put certain important matters on the back-burner for the next fortnight. But your judgment will have to be impeccable - nothing less will do. AQUARIUS Although there have been times when you have felt isolated and excluded from what seems to be going on all around you, other people should now be in a position to reassure you. Listen closely to what partners are really trying to say, especially if cash considerations are looming. 
GEMINI, Whatever mistakes you have made in recent times may soon be repeated, but with a difference: this time you'll have a chance to put things right and repair any rifts that have opened up. You see, although some emotional patterns come round again and again, each time your circumstances are different. CANCER You may be finding out that there is no such simple thing as good luck. Every opportunity involves a price; every new responsibility brings you into contact with new challenges and conflicts. It is in dealing with these situations that you mature and grow. 
LEO, As from today, you are going to find it that much harder to make yourself understood - the world will be full of brick walls, all inviting you to come and bang your head. On the other hand, a little flexibility and tolerance will work wonders - and gather goodwill for the future. 
VIRGO, You are still in a fiery phase and, with the correct approach, there is little that you can't achieve. You may, if you wish, sweep all opposition to one side with a single broad gesture. But make sure that you don't get rid of people you need in the process! 
LIBRA, Unless you are careful you may find yourself suddenly left high and dry when friends move on, possibly abandoning agreements that you thought were binding. You must reconsider your own motives over the next week or so - and don't get flustered if other people pressurise you. 
SCORPIO, Recent emotional queries and frustrations are shortly to emerge into the open. However, you will still be personally unwilling to come clean about a number of your hopes, wishes and inner motives. But, then, there is no reason why you should reveal all your deepest desires. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's difficult to work out whether you feel worse or better as a result of recent expenditure and purchases. One thing is certain, though, which is that your reactions have been overwhelmingly emotional. Perhaps an older relation has the advice you need - but you'll never know unless you ask. 
CAPRICORN, You're being affected by three different levels of planetary patterns. We'll start today with the short-term alignments that are bringing out your compassionate, maternal instincts but making you rather too sensitive. How about growing a thicker skin? AQUARIUS Anything that happens today will be obscured by shadows, perhaps the ghosts of the past. Your response will be an expanding need for privacy. However, it also seems that there'll be a great deal of routine business to attend to, the sort that keeps you good and busy. 
GEMINI, You are not exactly at a disadvantage, but neither is this an ideal time to make great strides at work. Concentrate instead on laying down firm foundations, including sorting out domestic hassles, and broadening your social contacts. Home entertaining is an excellent option any time after Tuesday. CANCER Some very fancy footwork is necessary if you are to maximise your current emotional advantages. If you delay, a recent opportunity will vanish before your very eyes, like a mirage in the desert. At work, you may be able to cast a spell over a colleague, turning someone who was a rival into a true friend. 
LEO, Matrimonial and partnership issues are still highlighted, though in a manner which is beginning to look increasingly expansive, hospitable, generous and optimistic. What could be better? You'll set the lead, and the first priority should be to attend to practical repairs. It's time to fix all broken fittings. 
VIRGO, Facts and figures which are uncovered this week will enable you to get one step ahead, both at home and at work. Good news will shore up your material security and a joint investment is beginning to look increasingly worthwhile. In love, though, you'll be keeping your secrets close to your chest. 
LIBRA, While your dominant financial influences are still very extravagant, it seems that most commitments and obligations are left over from the past and may not be strictly relevant to the present. A little economic rationalisation is in order, so be sure to prune all unwanted and outmoded commitments. 
SCORPIO, Simply stunning stars at work reveal the truth at last: you're a better worker than anyone else and you're now lined up for a gigantic pat on the back. In love, you'll aim for the top and turn down anything which smacks of second-best. However, in financial matters, a compromise is necessary, so try to find a middle way. 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll be chopping and changing, cancelling engagements and juggling commitments. The stars are still smiling on all those of you in love, but there is also time left for arranging artistic activities, pursuing pleasures and planning a party. At work, though, keep a sensible head on your shoulders. 
CAPRICORN, What a mysterious time this is. Something is happening, but what? Behind your planetary movements lies the fact that the stars do indeed have a sense of humour and that they sometimes like to confuse you. Keep your wits about you, for when the answers do come, events will move faster than expected. And don't forget the golden rule: believe in yourself. AQUARIUS Enjoy whatever good fortune comes your way. This should turn out to be quite a memorable time for affairs of the heart, so do take the initiative, happy in the knowledge that people and partners are likely to welcome your advances. At work your recent achievements will now lead to further opportunities. 
GEMINI, Secret and hidden resentment is your enemy. You see, long-forgotten frustrations may build up to the point where you blow up at completely the wrong person. Channel your righteous anger into selfless purposes, and always try to give partners and rivals the benefit of the doubt. Also Read | Big-bang India Inc.entive: Historic step, will attract global pvt investment, says PM CANCER The strongest planetary alignment in your chart suggests a combination of creative passion and social ambition. Woe betide the person who stands in your way! They are likely to find that you are much tougher than they thought. A word of advice: steer clear of financial risks. 
LEO, Partners and loved ones still hold the key to your happiness. Also, recent unexpected developments at work don't seem to have upset your confidence. It seems that it's undercurrents in your personal life which pose the greatest threat, and complacency your major enemy. Also Read | Caught on tape: retired HC judge assaulting daughter-in-law 
VIRGO, News from overseas, which should arrive over the next few days, may cause you to catch your breath. Travelling and other adventurous Virgos may expect excitement but should take absolutely nothing for granted. In addition to which, you'll put in any effort to make sure that partners are happy and healthy. 
LIBRA, Any financial commitment may be about to grow out of all proportion to the original aim. Only by savage pruning at the roots will you guarantee that potentially escalating costs can be cut. You'll probably be taking some radical, even shocking, decisions next week. 
SCORPIO, No matter how trying or upsetting the situation becomes, you must take very great care on the home front and consider the matter very carefully before sounding off. It is impossible to predict the outcome your actions may have on someone else's feelings or behaviour. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your chart is showing spectacular developments. With some wonderful planetary aspects now in operation, you are primed to achieve a great deal indeed. If possible, keep your end up by demonstrating to all and sundry that you are no stranger to hard work and high principles. Also Read | Chinmayanand held for sexual assault of law student, he has owned up: cops 
CAPRICORN, Feelings are running high and you'll be in a mood to take risks. I think you're in a strong position, but beware of false confidence, because there'll be times when you pick up the wrong end of the stick. Harmless adventures may be best. Keep an eye on your wallet. AQUARIUS You have a tendency to imagine that you can do without the support and co-operation of close friends and loved ones. Right now you're liable to swing between never wanting to have anything to do with somebody ever again and making a total life-long commitment. 
GEMINI, Business influences loom large. We're talking about commitments in the order of large purchases, domestic outlay and even property acquisitions. Overall, it's not a time for bargains. Your extravagant tendencies extend towards partnership proposals, and a lavish gesture could secure your ends. CANCER Look forward beyond immediate strains and see that your innate charm and personal grace are your biggest joint asset. Be confident and realise that, with a flutter of your eyelashes and a discreet wink, you can wrap almost anyone around your little finger. 
LEO, You are currently blessed with remarkable sensitivity and intuition. The only question is whether you can distinguish genuine perceptions from idle hopes, wishes and fears. This is not as easy as it sounds, especially as the facts seem to be shielded by a layer of fantasy. ALSO READ | Tiger count up but official photos show one in seven could just be a paper tiger 
VIRGO, A colleague or business associate should be taken to task although, if legal questions are on the agenda, you may be motivated by the broad spirit rather than the precise letter of the law. In other words, you're after justice rather than revenge! 
LIBRA, If you have been using finances as a lever to pressurise other people or have applied money as a means of emotional manipulation, then please take care. Any and all such devious actions may be about to blow up in your face. And that's precisely why you'd better play it straight. 
SCORPIO, If you're undecided, then why don't you wait until after the weekend before taking a firm choice as to the next stage or phase of activity. Above all, remember that current planetary influences tend to make you impulsive, reckless and liable to go over the top. READ | Under wraps so far: 252 habeas corpus pleas in J&amp;K HC since August 5 
SAGITTARIUS, You have some very intense needs at the moment, like your desire to be understood for a start! You're also in an ambitious mood; self-motivation is all very well, but you may pick up the wrong end of the stick. Don't take secret fears and worries too seriously. For some reason, your imagination is trying to wind you up! 
CAPRICORN, It's an uneven moment and you're picking up mixed messages from close partners. Even if all is sweetness and light there are rumblings of discontent. If you are able, you must be flexible with people who deserve your consideration, but firm with those who do not. READ | 25 letters to PM, $2.4 million, oil surveyor, judge — Howdy! AQUARIUS You may feel pulled in two directions, not necessarily a bad thing. You'll re-examine your choices and review all outstanding options. Over the coming days, home and family, emotion and intellect, imagination and practicality will appear as irreconcilable. The truth, however, may point in a different direction. 
GEMINI, It still seems inevitable that other people will have the advantage, perhaps because they hold the key to lost information and forgotten decisions. You may have to bow to pressure at home and let partners have their way. Partnership holds the key to everything.  CANCER Total self-knowledge is an impossible dream but, after all your recent struggles, most of you have come to terms with who you are. Your achievements in the personal field should stand you in good stead over the coming days, and you'll be buoyed up by the memory of past success.

LEO, It may well be that what is being arranged behind the scenes will lead to a very successful career move. However, it's time for words of commonsense advice again: all ambitious Leos should slow down and watch out for pitfalls. It's when life is going well that you forget essential precautions. 
VIRGO, Take a break from imaginative schemes and day-dreams and spare a thought for fundamental details at the most practical level. Nothing should be overlooked, no matter how small or apparently irrelevant. As an additional point, why don't you listen to older friends? There's a truth they'll reveal that you'd do well to heed. 
LIBRA, Everything is up in the air. To be perfectly honest, telepathy is probably the most reliable form of communication at the moment! And I know that's not saying much! What I really mean is that the facts should be taken with a pinch of salt. Check them out for yourself. ALSO READ | Once, in 2016, Arun Jaitley warned of pitfalls in holding simultaneous polls 
SCORPIO, You may discover that either you are about to reach your true desire, or that you were chasing a mirage. In any event, don't forget that current planetary pressures are largely to do with self-knowledge. If you know what you really and truly want, you'll be more likely to get it! 
SAGITTARIUS, New and unusual friends are turning up in your life, adding spice to the social scene. Everything that is about to take place on the work front will challenge you. You may have to revise your attitudes to colleagues or reassess the way you operate. Efficiency seems to be the key. 
CAPRICORN, You will have to make some kind of personal commitment before the next phase of your life can commence. Someone may be sweeter on you than you are on them. In any case, it is only fair to take other people's feelings into account, especially when you're in a position to help. READ | Jharkhand lynching case: Police bring back murder charge on Tabrez Ansari killing accused AQUARIUS The most important lessons in life are often the hardest to learn. In this respect, events over the next four or five days may confront you at the very heart of your Aquarian conservatism and obstinacy. I mean, it's amazing how resistant you can be to change! 
GEMINI, Your efforts at work should be rewarded financially at last. If you don't achieve some sort of monetary satisfaction then there's clearly something in your solar horoscope which is not being adequately expressed. Perhaps you have not taken sufficient responsibility for your own decisions. CANCER In spite of impressions to the contrary, partners are on your side. Still, you may experience a sudden flare-up in an intimate relationship, although you might feel better for it in the long run. Let the scales fall from your eyes at work and figure out what you need to do next. 
LEO, You often experience emotional conflict and insecurities which are derived from the position of the sensitive sign Cancer in your solar chart. The best estimate at the moment is that any such feelings are misplaced, and you may well be surprised at the support that's on the way. READ | UP: Dalit youth killed, ailing mother dead, accused says ‘did it for honour' 
VIRGO, If you have a problem, it's a tendency to be too hard on yourself. As of now, you should no longer feel quite so threatened or thwarted as so often in the past. The fact is that your social stars are extremely bright and there's a whole new world waiting to greet you. 
LIBRA, The Moon puts the focus on travel, communication and discussion. It's a day to get out and about, to talk over your feelings and generally get on with all lively activities. Sedentary Librans may be frustrated, though, so don't sit around while the world passes you by. ALSO READ | How PSA Board has become a rubber stamp — OKs almost all detention orders 
SCORPIO, Not for the first time the single most specific aspect in your solar chart points to long-distance love. It therefore goes without saying that travelling Scorpios are better placed to have pleasure than those at home. But there's another possibility as well, which is that a stranger comes to you. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your job may be to supply support and assistance to other people, thus putting your own interests in second place. Are you capable of such selfless actions? In the final analysis, I doubt if you'll have any choice. You'll see the situation much more clearly in a couple of days. 
CAPRICORN, You might be about to double-book yourself, so don't be too swept away by social invitations or personal initiatives. A business or financial matter of dubious origin is now hovering on the horizon, and you'd be advised to clear up outstanding issues sooner rather than later. READ | Assam: 3 sisters stripped and beaten at outpost, 2 cops suspended AQUARIUS If you wish, you may issue ultimatums to colleagues, but only if you are certain that all will be settled within a few days. There's one snag, and it's that partners have the edge, so if controversial actions are coming up, you might be wise to think again. 
GEMINI, The Moon is hopefully causing a radical change in your mood. As the hours pass, you should be feeling much more expansive, hopeful and optimistic. You're looking for ways to make some extra cash, but there may be savings to be had, first. It's not necessary to take a gamble. CANCER With the Moon now denoting such qualities as self-sacrifice, we may conclude that this is a period of routine chores and responsibilities. Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Actually you're in a very strong position and should be able to get your way in love as in all things. Read | Paytm founder had accused her of nearly bringing down firm, she is back as V-P 
LEO, Having suffered financial loss in the past, you are bound to look for scapegoats. On the other hand, rather than dwell on what might have been, I suggest that you get on and make plans for the future. In matters of the heart, you'll stand back and let partners take first place. 
VIRGO, The current planetary set-up indicates that, after a number of false starts, you will finally find your feet. It's time for lateral thinking: you may, if you wish, disregard professional and family pressures. Or at least you may postpone them until you are in a better position.

LIBRA, Venus, your graceful planetary ruler, is now taking you from a romantic alignment to Neptune towards a passionate one to Pluto. Over the next few days your resolve should therefore be stiffened. And yet it looks as if the meetings and encounters which are now on the cards could be delayed. 
SCORPIO, It's a mixed moment, emotionally. Although one particular romantic tie or involvement now seems to have weathered all kinds of storms, coming events may persuade you that you need to check whether you're getting what you need out of it. And remember - it's good to talk! 
SAGITTARIUS, Work, travel and business are all featured strongly in your chart this week. On the one hand this suggests that intimate affairs will be down-played, yet your motivations will be no less personal for that. Somehow you have to explore your own past. Read | Pulwama to Aug 5: Jammu and Kashmir HC indicted Govt for PSA arrests — in 80% cases 
CAPRICORN, There's a general air of anticipation, and colleagues or associates appear to be on tenterhooks, waiting for something to happen. There may be a number of cul-de-sacs, red herrings and false starts before your long-term serious questions are answered. AQUARIUS Your lunar movements should push you from a mood of introspection into one of adventure and openness to new experiences. The time for navel-gazing is in the past, the time for action is here. And, if you don't see that yourself, partners will take a hand. 
GEMINI, We'll start off with the good news: your stars are extremely prosperous. But here's the downside: romantic chaos and inspired confusion may be great fun but could result in costly mistakes. That's precisely why your main priority should be extra self-control. READ | Yogi Adityanath interview: ‘People now have faith that if I work as per law, I will get security, govt will support me' CANCER The typical Cancerian is a peace-loving creature, but you can still be easily provoked. Looking at the week as a whole, you may move from an idyllic illusion of perpetual harmony towards a realisation that a battle must be joined. And, when it comes, the struggle will be one of ideas rather than emotions. 
LEO, Sometimes life is just not what it seems. Yet you have a huge amount going for you. This might be more obvious to other people than it is to you. That's why you have to trust in the future - and have faith that you are indeed on the right track. 
VIRGO, Everything that takes place this week will be encouraged by the fact that Mercury, your ruling planet, is now in an increasingly lively condition. Your smart ideas will help you pick your way through a rapidly approaching emotional minefield. READ | Vadodara: MS University asks its students to join rally against Article 370 
LIBRA, If the past few weeks have been free from disagreements then you're lucky. However, although, the nature of the game is changing, I don't think any of you will be unaware of the turbulent undercurrents building up this week. Keep your eye on the ball, Libra. 
SCORPIO, You'll soon have a new and brighter perspective on the immediate future. In fact, if you're a typical mainstream Scorpio, you may rub your hands with glee at what is just around the corner. If you've spoken out against certain practical arrangements and restrictive obligations, you may soon be vindicated. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have little understanding of other people's intense feelings. You may even be rather bemused by this week's emotional events and general air of hysteria. Unless, that is, you have been here, done that and got the tee shirt. Experience counts for a lot! READ | NASA lunar probe to fly over landing site tomorrow, may shed new light on Vikram 
CAPRICORN, Your emotional and romantic stars could not be better, so, if you're in difficulties, the key lies in your own complicated expectations and too high standards. Take other people at face value and assume that they are being straight with you, at least for now. AQUARIUS The winds of change will be blowing, gently at first but then with great force. By all means relax, but retain a guarded approach to all developments, not just those which are obviously dodgy. If other people do end up putting pressure on you, then it's probably because you need them to give you a shove in the right direction. 
GEMINI, Most of your planets are in that part of your chart which encourages you to project yourself in public and play down your personal feelings. However, don't ignore your very real individual needs. Mercury, your planetary ruler, is in a poetic mood, and you may create a vibrant impression. CANCER There are times of year when the planets offer you a degree of inspiration that takes you beyond the normal limits of your life. To make the most of such trends you must consciously look for ways to improve your lot. Such a time is now. Read | J&amp;K: Shopian villagers line up at DC's office to ask about their young men 
LEO, Very interesting developments are taking place in the area of your chart ruling your finances. There does seem to be some confusion, but also a great opportunity to benefit from any savings or investments. Money is a concern, although there are definitely some excellent bargains to be had. Keep your eyes open!  
VIRGO, Life's not all plain sailing at the moment, but then nobody ever said it would be. The one area of opportunity is romance, which many of you, for one reason of another, have tended to ignore. The next set of lunar alignments falls in a lively, assertive part of your chart, setting you off on a new cycle of adventure. 
LIBRA, Venus and Mars combine to offer the best planetary influences as far as relationships with loved ones and children are concerned. You must, though, act in line with your individual feelings, for only you know what is best. There is bound to be a major mystery early in the week, and that could set your mind thinking about fresh ideas and new ambitions. 
SCORPIO, Your planetary influences this week are potentially highly pleasurable. And this, more than anything, is why you really must find some time to enjoy yourself free from the cares and burdens of everyday life. Please don't waste this valuable opportunity! One other point to bear in mind is that emotional ties could prove costly. Read | Before UNGA, Trump may come for Modi Houston show 
SAGITTARIUS, Short journeys are on the cards, as are pleasurable family encounters. If you have brothers or sisters, they are the relatives who will be most important over the coming two weeks. Otherwise, stick with those friends who you know and trust as yourself. Any professional upsets should be cleared up with a bit of goodwill. 
CAPRICORN, Emotional ties are not always what they seem. The indications that a new partnership could be profitable financially are growing stronger. Perhaps a new friend will come up with a lucrative proposal. It's certainly a positive time to take a gamble  as long as the odds are on your side. AQUARIUS Venus and Mars are the two planets which rule your social life, making you irresistible to other people. Now that both these marvellous celestial bodies are offering you their support you will at last make new friends. Oh, and your financial stars will improve as the week passes, bringing hints of new prosperity. 
GEMINI, Your salvation lies in human contact and warmth. There are three sectors of your chart dealing with other people, of which the two that now take your notice rule intimate romantic partners and casual acquaintances. Professional colleagues - and partners with whom you share your daily routine - will have to wait their turn. CANCER It's an emotional day, and there'll be little time for rational thought. You are therefore likely to discover that all your words of wisdom have fallen on deaf ears. When it comes to money, you may wait a little longer, perhaps another three months, to make your fortune. 
LEO, You can remain silent no longer. You have no choice but to say your piece, but you may be pleasantly surprised when people stop and listen for a change. Emphasise adventurous plans and lay yourself on the line. You never know, you might actually discover hidden talents! READ | Income Tax serves notices to Reliance First Family under Black Money Act 
VIRGO, The cosmos always has more tricks up its sleeve. Just when you thought you were on safe ground, in came more bills. Actually, today's strenuous planetary picture gives you the chance to do more than settle immediate accounts. You may, if you wish, take steps to guarantee your long-term security. 
LIBRA, This is a time to be more concerned with what has been built up over the years of toil and strife. Don't be too bothered by friction or tension at work or at home. Do take the opportunity to make a sort of personal new year's resolution, vowing to achieve a special ambition within the next twelve months. 
SCORPIO, The time is finally here to think about restoring a sense of inner meaning to your daily affairs. You may consider it right and proper to encourage others to stand on their own two feet, but do offer any help that you can. After all, people have been good to you deserve something in return, however, small. ALSO READ | Allahabad University: ‘Fearing lynching', assistant prof goes on indefinite leave 
SAGITTARIUS, By rights you ought to have a free hand in affairs of the heart, but don't get so preoccupied with one person that you forget your friends. By the way, you should also be aware of the need for improvements in relations with children - and younger people in general. 
CAPRICORN, It's a fine moment for some light relief. The only way to deal with tension that pervades the air today is to keep your sense of humour well to the fore and remind other people that events that seem like the end of the world will evoke laughter in times to come. READ | A murdered Pak leader's son appeals to PM Modi: ‘Don't give asylum to my dad's killer' AQUARIUS It's time to stand up and be counted, so don't be ashamed to be an out and out idealist today. If others should ever accuse you of being impractical, so what? If they are that efficient, let them complete all the tasks which are a drain on your energy! You have bigger fish to fry. 
GEMINI, A delicate mixture of courage and conservatism suits you best at the moment. You have been happy to sail on uncharted waters, but by next week a sense of caution may return. Compare notes with close friends sooner rather than later and set aside some time this evening to pamper yourself. CANCER Seldom has so much needed to be reviewed and reorganised, but arrangements should be complete very soon. Then you'll realise that certain home and family commitments are more time-consuming than you once thought. If you want to blame anyone, don't. Blame the stars instead! READ | Pakistan takes hard line on Kulbhushan Jadhav: No plan for consular access again 
LEO, Your emotional ties are being put to the test, and you may wonder if one particular commitment is really worth the grief. My advice would be to try to distinguish between genuine feelings of affection on the one hand and a need for security at any price on the other. 
VIRGO, You're in a strong, decisive and determined state of mind, but it's just at times like these that you'll do best to put other people first. Once again, it is a fine moment to remember the occasions when family members have done you a good turn. There seems to be a change of mood during the day, most likely resulting in a more relaxed and generous attitude. ALSO READ | Manmohan Singh: $5-trillion economy by 2024 looks like pipe dream 
LIBRA, There is no need to stifle your creativity or dampen your emotions. You might feel under the weather, but celestial relief will soon arrive in the form of beneficial lunar alignments, helping you to get back on your feet and turn the tables on a rival. 
SCORPIO, Whether you feel you have been let down at work, or prevented from attaining your wishes at home, you may recognise that such disappointments are not final, only temporary. You'll be back in the fray in no more than four weeks, ready to do your level best. READ | MMTC seeks import of Pakistan onions, farmers angry 
SAGITTARIUS, Adverse or challenging aspects indicate that you have experienced a personal upheaval lately. It may be quite true that someone hasn't been entirely fair, but there are only another two weeks to go before harsh words should be completely forgotten. 
CAPRICORN, Given that your celestial alignments have indeed been most confusing, the patience and tolerance you have shown in dealing with a financial matter deserve congratulations. Recent expenditure however, may have been but a rehearsal for the real thing. AQUARIUS You do tend to take on rather too much, don't you? You may be wondering if you have set yourself an impossible task. If so, you have done right. The only way to get what you want and end up where you need to be, is to take on more than you can cope with! 
GEMINI, It's a nervous moment, and people around you may be jumping to conclusions for no good reason. Everyone concerned seems to be too ready to take offence, but have you considered that it might be too easy for you to make a mistake? If you fire on all cylinders you may inadvertently say the wrong thing! Also Read | Militant build-up across LoC, border; many attempts to infiltrate: J&amp;K Police CANCER You've not always been a good judge of character, partly because you always wanted to believe the best, and also because you tend to jump to instant conclusions. You deserve admiration for your trusting qualities, but perhaps you are finally seeing others as they really are. 
LEO, You have survived one emotional challenge, although there may well be ripples for some time yet. You should rein in your horns if you've overstretched yourself in any personal matter, and conserve your resources. This is a reckless moment, but you can let other people take the risks, especially if there are likely to be hidden costs. 
VIRGO, All eyes will be on you. The planets aligned with public and professional sectors of your horoscope are still very strong, but in view of the generally emotional overtones of today's lunar impact, I would expect close relations and intimate friends to be urging you on. Also Read | Site decided, Govt clears mega solar project in Leh and Kargil 
LIBRA, Although you're in a generally sociable phase, during which partnerships must take first priority, today's stellar picture puts the emphasis firmly on privacy. Solitude is a valuable asset and you need to be left alone to get on with your personal ambitions in peace. 
SCORPIO, You tend to blow hot and cold in emotional relationships, enthusing one minute, retreating behind your shell the next. If you start behaving like this now, take care, otherwise someone may give you a dose of your own medicine next week! But if you can dish it out, you should be ready to take it! 
SAGITTARIUS, You're walking a tight rope, willing to take risks, but not prepared to lose. Worldly ambitions, including professional aspirations, loom large. If you wish to make the most of your undoubted assets, proceed intuitively and, if you're responsible for other people, show them you care. Also Read | Chinmayanand case: Day after ‘video', student's father says recorder taken away 
CAPRICORN, There have been so many frustrations and delays, but only because you expect so much. You may now begin to let up at work and place more emphasis on relaxation and pleasure. Also, secure firm agreement from close relations, particularly children. AQUARIUS Personal money matters and joint financial arrangements are both high on the agenda. The signs are that you'll be in an emotional mood and not too happy with people who take you for granted. That doesn't mean, though, that you should waste your own money dealing with them. 
GEMINI, Recently many of you have been concealing an iron fist in a velvet glove, and I should imagine that anyone crossing your path has run the risk of being flattened. Don't feel bad about being assertive, and don't hold yourself back. Sometimes you have to be firm to be kind. CANCER You may begin to bring all professional aims and aspirations to a final conclusion. I'm not saying that this is your last chance, only that after this week you should be sure of your strategy. Take the opportunity to enjoy improving emotional conditions. READ | Pakistan using UN forum for malicious agenda: India 
LEO, If you are typical of your birth sign, you are probably beginning to feel a mite frustrated. Has something big passed you by? You may feel that it has, but don't worry. You are in fact being given a chance to prepare yourself for when the fortunate day does finally arrive. 
VIRGO, The stars will be leaning in your direction and you'll soon be able to tackle an outstanding family issue or domestic question. You may find your fluctuating emotions a little perplexing, but not to any serious extent. One word of advice, though: always make sure you're fully guaranteed and insured before taking any risks with your security. 
LIBRA, Pause for a moment. You may have arranged a busy schedule or you may have planned a day off. This is not important. What is vital is that wherever you are, whatever you're doing, you allow a little time for self-reflection and spiritual re-charging. ALSO READ | Bihar medical admission loophole: Low ranks mean top colleges 
SCORPIO, Once you get moving you'll gain a great deal of satisfaction out of organising other people. Perhaps that's because deep down you know what's best and they don't! Whatever your motivations, make this a sociable day. Even at work you'll be happiest as part of a team. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should be thinking more like an individual, less like one of the herd. But at work you may have to put your ideas aside in the cause of co-operation. Socially, continue to take the initiative, but recognise that shared activities are vital if a relationship is to last. 
CAPRICORN, You will be liable to come a cropper if you try to bend the rules. The best way to use today's efficient planetary energies is to look far afield: arrange holiday plans, get in touch with relatives who are overseas, and bring a touch of the exotic into your home. READ | Apple iPhone 11 series is here, so is aggressive pricing on Apple services AQUARIUS You will have to be businesslike. This may be advice which runs contrary to certain anarchic impulses in your character, but if you practise your skills now you'll be much better placed later in the year when good organisation and responsibility will be essential. 
GEMINI, Any discussions with family members, or news about emotional ties, are bound to be pleasant. At the best you will experience a sense of hope and personal liberation. If you wish, you may abandon the lack of confidence which has so often held you back. CANCER All your instincts and hunches may tell you that this is the time to splash out, and they could well be right! If you feel a generous impulse coming on, you may give it free rein and count the cost tomorrow. But if partners are likely to disagree, you'd better get them on your side first. READ | Son denied deal, contractor hired men to assault SAIL chief: Police 
LEO, You're still in control, even if the flag of emotional revolt does happen to be raised very soon. If you are faced with anger at home, don't confront it. Gently deflect bad feeling in the manner of an oriental sage, and so disarm your opponent with goodwill. 
VIRGO, Sometimes you're willing to face big personal challenges head on. A bone of contention may relate to a home or family matter, but if I were you I'd leave well alone today. If you do want to get your own way, and which of us doesn't, hold your horses until tomorrow. Read more: Apple September event today: What to expect from iPhone 11, and what not to  
LIBRA, You are now in an ideal position to take the initiative socially. Even at work you will be able to galvanise other people, although it looks as if you should leave them to figure out the details. I should think it will be good for them to take a little responsibility for their own actions. 
SCORPIO, You're reaching a minor turning point in your material affairs. At this stage, you must either complete a financial deal or think about writing off a small sum of money for good. The fact is that pursuing such issues may not be worth your valuable time. ALSO READ | Police chargesheet drops murder charge against 11 accused in Tabrez killing 
SAGITTARIUS, The world is about to see you at your best, and I mean the whole world. If you have any aspirations at all to set off on a tour of distant parts, there is no time like the present. At the very least you should get in touch with relations in far away places. 
CAPRICORN, You often experience emotional insecurities and conflicts. The last thing you should do is to revive old battles, especially over pointless issues like who pays for, or owns, what. A generous gesture would be a far better alternative, and could win you a friend for life. READ | Big tech firms had e-waste centres but only on paper, many addresses fake: Delhi probe AQUARIUS If you are to achieve the kind of acceptance you have always craved, you must make a bid now. The close relationship between the Moon, Jupiter and a series of other planets indicates that, if you give them the chance, other people will at last be ready to listen and help. 
GEMINI, It's an awkward moment, no doubt. For some reason the planets just refuse to play ball. No matter what steps you take to ensure that people tell you what's going on, it won't make much difference. You see, even if you know the facts, you still won't understand why people are behaving as they are. CANCER I know you know it's true, but I'd still like to remind you that life is what you make it. The only sound advice any astrologer can give you is to wake up and catch up. The world has moved on overnight and certain of your arrangements or attitudes may now be well past their sell-by date. 
LEO, You don't have to compete to be noticed today. If the Moon and Jupiter do their work you need only wave your hand for others to fall into line. If you're planning the next stage in your ambitions, then pin your hopes on the middle of the day, the time when your most private aspirations could receive a public airing. 
VIRGO, You've got plenty of get-up-and-go, but colleagues and other conditions seem to get in the way. You face the prospect of floundering around like a beached whale, but the way to avoid confusion is simply to defer all dubious activities, so if you have any doubts whatsoever, hang on for a few days. Read | If we pick up 5, we keep one. just a few hundred with us: J&amp;K DGP 
LIBRA, Sometimes you love to be sentimental, but now you are likely to find yourself in a position where you simply have to be business-like about your feelings. You may have to put serious and intimate encounters on hold while you pursue your social goals in a frivolous manner. 
SCORPIO, Apparent difficulties and dramas may be far from distressing. In fact, this looks like a moment of rare professional power, so if you're anxious to get on at work, push yourself forward and take the resulting friction in your stride. You can always charm your way out of a tight corner! 
SAGITTARIUS, If you've got things to talk about, don't spend too much time going over old ground. You must be practical, on the other hand, and this means that you should pay due deference to the way certain matters were done in the past. Not everything your ancestors did is to be so easily dismissed! Explained | Has Chandrayaan-2 failed? How big a setback this is to ISRO? 
CAPRICORN, The Moon is coursing through vital and varied areas of your chart, so busy times at work look set to continue for a few days yet. Right now, though, you may glimpse the prospect of financial reward. Joint finances seem to be important and great good fortune may come via close partners. AQUARIUS There are many important decisions involving your personal life, but that doesn't rule out the prospect of having fun along the way. Indeed, today you should be able to combine business with pleasure as never before! A new social contact may even guide you to success in a public ambition in the future. 
GEMINI, Social commitments are likely to prove costly. What can you have done to incur such large expenses? All that can be achieved now is damage-limitation to salvage what you can out of a financial mess. Mercury will enable you to stay the course, but only because it encourages you to face the real facts of the situation. CANCER You really ought to press ahead with professional activities if that is what concerns you at the moment. Many Cancerians will be rooting on behalf of a partner or loved one who is aiming for promotion. You may still be facing some opposition over a vital personal matter, but don't let it bother you. 
LEO, If you know what's good for you, you'll start planning a break now, whether it's a short trip or a long-distance journey. There is no need to worry about all those extra commitments here at home, as these should easily be taken care of by other responsible people - at least, in theory! On the whole, this is still a positive period of change and growth. 
VIRGO, In many ways it's a mysterious week. Someone may be encouraging you to take a risk, but you must be warned that this is not the ideal time to gamble. If you do decide to go for a get-rich-quick scheme, then you must keep something in reserve. In fact, if you plan for the future now, you will thank yourself that you were so far-seeing. 
LIBRA, Social trends are looking better and better, the only drawback being that some of your wildest hopes may remain unfulfilled. Be realistic from the start, otherwise someone may let you down. Venus, planet of love, maintains a good romantic and social outlook and you may soon meet one individual who will have a major impact on your life. 
SCORPIO, Your two planetary rulers, energetic Mars and obstinate Pluto, are still in a challenging relationship. As they move, they will be like the irreversible force meeting the immovable object, so be prepared. Overall, this is a time for independence and for striking out on a new course. Yet, if you require more freedom, you must offer the same to partners. 
SAGITTARIUS, By and large the planets are very well positioned. The only word of caution is to avoid plots and conspiracies and, if you are feeling bitter or resentful, not to direct your anger against the wrong target. A generally adventurous air suits you down to the ground, and I can see you taking the initiative across the board. 
CAPRICORN, Everything should go according to plan, just as long as you get your family relationships and domestic affairs in order. This is why you should do everything in your power to reach early agreement with relatives. Swift action now will guarantee your future security, at least in the short-term. AQUARIUS You can now begin to push ahead with a very private goal, one which seems to have romantic overtones. Travel is very strongly figured in your solar horoscope, encouraging you to take a short break. It is more likely that you will go somewhere nearby than far afield. Make final plans soon. 
GEMINI, You've a knack of smiling and keeping everyone happy, but perhaps at the cost of accepting that you won't get what you want. If you push too hard then you may only antagonise people whose affection and support you need. That's why extra subtlety is called for today. CANCER You may not be free to act exactly as you want, but that doesn't mean that you can't safeguard your own interests financially and at work. It's a busy day and one in which not to be distracted from your goals. If you're not satisfied with social engagements, then take the lead and make your own arrangements. 
LEO, Something just doesn't seem to be working out socially. It may be best to mix with people with whom you feel genuinely close and not to labour the point with more distant acquaintances. After all, you don't want to waste your time on those who you may never see again. Follow Chandrayaan-2 LIVE updates 
VIRGO, Although superficially you have no real reason to worry about anything, it takes a lot to deal with your secret fears. However, you can easily forget your woes by confessing all to family members or immersing yourself in a favourite hobby. A problem shared could turn out to be a problem halved. 
LIBRA, Your stars are notably pleasant, and even certain combative influences may emerge only as a sort of sharp and ready wit, perhaps a healthy burst of sarcasm. Short trips could prove surprisingly stimulating, and you may never know what lies around the next corner. 
SCORPIO, Some people just don't know when to leave well alone. Others still imagine that they can run your life. How wrong they are. If they haven't learned that you are an independent soul, they never will, and you may have to consider changing your old friends for new ones! 
SAGITTARIUS, This is a special time of year, a time to make wishes and shape your destiny for the coming period. In about another week or so you'll be flying high, and nobody will be able to stop you.

CAPRICORN, A development that touches you deep in your heart will please you but may cause you to think again. If you are moved to make a generous gesture, then don't let anyone hold you back. Don't be afraid of being thought to be flashy, either: sometimes you have a perfect right to show off! AQUARIUS Family influences are friendly, so get the most out of any welcome engagements and make up for any past rifts or misunderstandings. One friend or colleague will be happy to hear from you, so if you've been wondering whether to get in touch, then go right ahead.

GEMINI, You seem to be avoiding trouble - and good for you. If you can side-step angry or demanding people, then so much the better. But I don't think you'll gain anything from burying your head in the sand, ostrich-style. If you face up to secret fears, they may actually go away! Read | Chidambaram in cell 15, ward 2, jail 7 of Tihar: Cot with 6 blankets, a fan overhead CANCER A fog of uncertainty is refusing to clear up. A mystery may continue in the background, but there is almost a nil chance that you, or anyone, will truly understand what is going on. If you're under the weather, one cause may be an emotional or nervous strain. 
LEO, Astrology is seldom to do with luck, pure and simple. Right now, though, there seems to be good fortune for the asking, but you know better than anyone that good fortune is what you make it. Tension at home should be in the past and complications at work should have eased. Also read | Chandrayaan-2: 15 ‘terrifying' minutes to history tonight 
VIRGO, It's a fine time for a spot of extravagance, particularly if partners have been holding you back lately. Family decisions and domestic plans are likely to work only if they concern short-term and day-to-day affairs. Long-range plans may be fun to formulate, but are unlikely to come into effect. 
LIBRA, The general trend is still quite sober but you may, if you wish, take some time off to enjoy yourself. Serious discussions, meetings, interviews and even unwelcome chance encounters may point you in the right direction and the chances of uncovering the truth are good. Explained | What ED and I-T have against Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar 
SCORPIO, Monetary influences combine with domestic, and you may go out and spend on home essentials but, for those of you in the property market or otherwise wielding large amounts of money, the signs are good and getting better. Why don't you check out travel options? You deserve a change of scene. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's a complicated moment, that's for sure. Communication is the key, but co-operation may be hard to achieve. Some of you will be called away on a short journey. All of you will be faced with information to absorb and decisions to take. You'd better get on with it!

CAPRICORN, It may seem as if, having dramatically changed your mind on many occasions, you now have decided to let fate take its course. That's the long-term consideration. As far as today is concerned it's money which looms large, especially for domestic commitments. AQUARIUS You should be in the driving seat today. You may be able to take the initiative and compensate for a few recent blunders. An argumentative mood may be dealt with nice if you are the very essence of charm. Pay a little more attention to domestic grumbles - before they become insoluble. 
GEMINI, Your deeply-held personal beliefs are about to be challenged, but you probably know that it takes a lot to make you change your mind. However, if you decide to be more flexible than usual, you could succeed where last time you failed and attract people who once ignored you. Also Read | J&amp;K: 290 booked under PSA since August 5, says official CANCER You're raring to go, convinced that you've got it right, and if you haven't already got the bit between your teeth, you soon will. The trouble is, though, that while there are pressures driving you to be busier than usual, you find it hard to pin down exactly what needs doing. 
LEO, How far can you go? That is the question of the moment. Perhaps another way to put it might be - how big a risk are you prepared to take? You&amp;'re in a gambling mood and this, combined with a note of realism, suggests that you could come out on top. 
VIRGO, Time marches on, and family and domestic affairs are now dominant. The entire web of relationships with everyone you've known since birth will begin to impinge on your consciousness, colouring the way you express your emotions and arrange your private affairs.

LIBRA, You're broadening your horizons, which is definitely a good thing. But just a word to those of you planning adventurous activities such as overseas journeys and explorations: delays are due to continue for another six weeks but are not insurmountable. All of you should take it slowly and give yourselves plenty of time. 
SCORPIO, You've got to get your proper priorities sorted out. Extravagant commitments are one thing, businesslike discussions another. Family members, people you live with and anyone with whom you're emotionally involved, will need to know your intentions. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may have been caught up short, perhaps by realising just how much you have taken on. Actually, about a third of the members of your sign has a deep and highly impressive practical streak which most astrologers ignore. So, you should now be on safe ground.

CAPRICORN, Try not to take major decisions on the basis of too hopeful a picture of things to come. Instinctively you're on the right track but, as soon as you stop to think, you may lose the thread. There is every chance of a major offer, but it could have a surprising twist in its tail. AQUARIUS You won't be prepared to give anything away today, no doubt for your own very good reasons. The one central problem seems to be an uncharacteristic lack of confidence, but it should pass quite quickly. Major material pressures will likewise be temporary. 
GEMINI, It will take a great deal of effort to reach your goals, as I am sure you know. Close partners should be extremely helpful, and very probably ready to lend a helping hand, just as long as you ask. Also, take an overdue decision: you seem to have put off the big moment for far too long. CANCER You still seem to be taking three steps backwards for every one forwards - and quite possibly one step sideways as well. The planets are sending you a message that you should give up one or two responsibilities and put a goal in cold storage, perhaps until next year.

LEO, If you wish to be spontaneous, take a leaf out of children's plans and activities. In spite of the fact that the day's lunar alignments are somewhat sober, you should find a way to loosen up and let your hair down. The chances of romance are high, but it may be a place which attracts your fancy rather than a person. 
VIRGO, You may be slightly accident-prone, yet as usual, you are determined to get the job done properly. At work, your main problem may be anger or irritation over past slights or hurts. The emotional temperature has dipped, perhaps to your great relief. 
LIBRA, Give and take is the order of the day, but it is also important to be in control at home. Mid-morning alignments are romantic, but also somewhat muddled, suggesting that expert assistance is vital. Perhaps you should admit that, for once, you haven't got everything taped! 
SCORPIO, If you are wondering just when life is going to get back to normal, the answer should be now. In fact, the vast majority of people born under your sign may be able to sit back and rest on their laurels. What's more, the emotional tide is about to turn in your favour.

SAGITTARIUS, A word of advice for the whole week: fretting and fuming will do no good. You have to acknowledge that you are rushing ahead of other people, and they must really be given sufficient time to catch up. Besides, you could do with time to pause for breath. 
CAPRICORN, It's fine to be secretive and secluded, but you must maintain a continual check on your motives. By all means, go behind people's backs if you have everyone's best interests at heart. But be warned that if they find out what you're doing by accident, then they may not be best pleased. AQUARIUS Your stars are looking fabulous from the social point of view. However, while casual friendships appear particularly well-aspected, intimate and passionate links may seem stuck on the launching-pad. The person who can help could be the last one you think of. 
GEMINI, Some astrologers will be forecasting personal tiffs this week, and I'd agree that these are very likely. However, I want to take your horoscope one stage further and suggest that you bide your time, bite your tongue and maintain a discreet, diplomatic silence. CANCER A number of revelations should have crept up on you over the past few weeks, and you may have a clearer realisation of who you are and where you're going. However, your new understanding is instinctive and therefore extremely difficult to put into words. ALSO READ | Investor summit on cards, Valley business leaders in detention 
LEO, Do you now realise that you must stand up and be counted for who you are, not for the person others want you to be? Take a spot of astrological advice and be bold, creative and colourful. Why not take more pleasure in all that life has to offer? 
VIRGO, When you stop thinking you know all the answers, you will begin to learn. Mercury, the planet of the mind, is now occupying a very strong position in your solar chart, urging you to think again. It will also raise certain emotional questions, especially in matters relating to your security. 
LIBRA, Travel plans and communications are to the fore, but it won't be the end of the world if a few plans have to be delayed. In two weeks' time, and again in four weeks' time, you'll be able to bring your intentions to fruition, so don't expect the earth to move this week.

SCORPIO, Somehow, your best efforts may begin to come adrift. You may hold things together by realising that you and you alone are responsible, and also by checking up on all financial angles and implications. But can you really afford it? That is the question! 
SAGITTARIUS, There's still a great deal of optimism around, but you must take care of first things first. This means dealing with money, making essential purchases, arranging vital investments or taking steps to raise your earnings. Take a look around yourself - there's someone who deserves to benefit from your generosity. 
CAPRICORN, Symbolically speaking, the Moon is under your control. In plain language, this means that family members and people you live with must be at your beck and call. Play your cards right and you'll get almost anything you want out of almost anybody but, if you're waiting for a partner to do the right thing, then you might have a long wait! READ | Substandard mid-day meal: UP files FIR against reporter AQUARIUS There will be fiddly loose ends to be tied up, mainly at work, but also in certain private affairs. It's time to consider other people, and a self-centred attitude may cost you support and sympathy. Romantic liaisons require an old-fashioned and self-controlled approach. 
GEMINI, A number of odd and slightly tense events are on the way, if not today then certainly by tomorrow. The general mood will improve if you make an effort to put yourself in somebody else's shoes. See the world as they see it; you might be pleasantly surprised - and intrigued. Read | Happy Ganesh Chaturthi 2019: Wishes Images, Status, Quotes, Pictures, Pics, and Greetings CANCER An interesting point known as the Moon's south node has now turned its gaze in your direction. This may incline you to repeat past mistakes over the next few months. If, however, you learn certain fundamental lessons, your trials will not be in vain. 
LEO, Help is on hand. Those intense celestial aspects which have been disturbing you recently are no longer causing trouble. Their only legacy may be a number of regrets, a little bad feeling and, for some, a broken heart. Please now realise that your stars are taking a dramatic turn for the better. 
VIRGO, You can now afford to stop thinking quite so hard. Pressure in parts of your chart connected to communication should make the options and alternatives that much simpler. If you can possibly look afresh at old and tired emotional complications, please do so. Also read | Ganesh Chaturthi 2019: Puja Vidhi, Timings, Muhurat, Samagri, Process, Procedure 
LIBRA, Matters close to home are quite complicated, but then there's nothing new in that, is there? The advantage over the next week or so is that you can afford to talk about your fears and share your hopes with people who, for once, will listen. The very fact that they are prepared to examine your plans anew is encouraging. 
SCORPIO, You're flexing your emotional muscles, life is getting better and you should be able to relax, be happy and let the world flow by. The only problem, which may be insurmountable, is your famous inability to forgive and forget. Don't let regrets or resentment stand in your way.

SAGITTARIUS, A perfect aspect to Jupiter, perhaps the single most important planet in your horoscope, should set you up for a splendid time, perhaps lasting a couple of weeks. If anything goes wrong, it will be your fault. That's good because it means that the remedy also lies in your hands. 
CAPRICORN, You might lower your sights today. It's not often I offer such advice, but the point is that if your standards are artificially high, you'll limit your horizons and miss out on opportunities, even minor ones, for family contentment and job satisfaction. AQUARIUS Friends may be too rushed even to say good-morning;, but don't take it to heart. If people are indeed too speedy for you, it's probably nothing more than the planets'; way of keeping you on your toes. Actually, it's a perfect moment for stopping the clock and signing settled agreements. 
GEMINI, Career prospects are growing stronger for all you ambitious Geminians. Even those of you without paid employment will be making your mark in the world, perhaps through a voluntary enterprise. What I would say, though, is that it is personal contacts which will help you along in every sphere of life. It's who you know, not what you know, that counts. Read | Excluded from NRC in Assam: 19,06,657 CANCER It's a week for hard work and self-discipline. That may not sound like fun, but just think of all you're going to accomplish over the next seven days. At times like these, patience is a virtue. You must recognise that you will achieve none of your aims without practical assistance from partners. Accept help when it is given, and don't let your pride get in the way. ;t=152s 
LEO, As Mercury ceases one intense aspect to your sign, so Venus is moving into another. You must now put your social and romantic plans into action: the time for talk is over and you may follow your instincts. At the same time, might I advise that you recognise the virtues of hard work and realise that you won't get something for nothing?

VIRGO, All Virgoans involved in the world of work have been dealing in important discussions. Some of you have even been applying for jobs recently. Now you will begin to see the benefits in your relationships. Romantic indications are good and improving. It's a positive phase socially, so go out and create those longed-for opportunities. 
LIBRA, The big change comes as a result of Venus' move deeper into friendly and supportive regions, just as Mercury stirs up your passions. Close romantic and family relationships will soon become much more enjoyable, and you could begin to appreciate a new union. Until then, you should press ahead with current engagements, realising that punctuality is vital. Read | Team Kashmir: Meet officials who have been holding the fort since lockdown 
SCORPIO, Your emotional planets offer you a much-needed shot in the arm. Now is the time to put forward your very individual Scorpionic ideas with the self-assurance that results from being right. One very personal proposal will come your way. But even intimate suggestions must be discussed with friends, especially if you want to keep them on your side. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's all go on the family front! You may still not be clear about what improvements are needed, but there is no harm in pressing ahead and finding this out by the usual process of trial and error. Jupiter, your planetary ruler, is now moving erratically, raising your morale and boosting your spirits. 
CAPRICORN, From this week, you will have to rely on practical talents in addition to your social skills. Plus, from now on, it will be personal contacts that oil the wheels of success and happiness. On the other hand, have you ever considered the fact that what you normally consider to be success may not be what you really need? Explained | ‘Genesis of the Kashmir issue does not lie in Article 370; solution doesn't lie in it' AQUARIUS Being born under Aquarius, the Water Carrier, means that you tend to carry other people's burdens on your shoulders. Never was this more so than now, so it's time to get involved in charitable activities. Don't be unduly concerned by the occasional delay, for a postponement might give you the chance to take a much-needed second look. 
GEMINI, Evening stars look best if entertaining or passionate encounters are on your mind. Don't allow the pressures of the day to force you into cancelling engagements. Relationships with children will improve if you make it clear that there are lines which should never be crossed, but offer plenty of security as well. CANCER Although in general it's a day to deal with practical chores, I think that you won't get very far if you try to tackle outstanding domestic issues. These may be best left until tomorrow when your lunar patterns begin to look more businesslike. ALSO READ | Assam's final NRC today, CM Sarbananda Sonowal says will help people left out 
LEO, The Sun's relationship with Neptune is romantic in the broadest sense, arousing dreams of future success. However, the fact that work and routine chores are set to loom large over the weekend will bring you back down to earth. There are ways to ease problems by throwing money at them. 
VIRGO, Although you may still feel out on a limb or out of touch, it may help to know that your stars are still broadly helpful. Issues of principle are dear to your heart. Travel plans may be delayed or deferred but relations with children should be better than before. 
LIBRA, Adverse alignments to planets in strategic zones of your solar chart are overwhelmed by easy ones. There's a natural evolution to the day's developments and after a while you will become aware of a change in mood and very soon partners will be encouraging you to recover your rightful place. 
SCORPIO, If somebody you know is being terribly annoying or just plain uncooperative, you know what you have to do about it. Be strongly Scorpionic and let them learn from their own mistakes, secure in the knowledge that they will come round and agree with you in the end. READ | Big bank reform: 10 merged into four for scale and growth 
SAGITTARIUS, Once in a while, you are given the chance to back up your dreams with some hard cash. I am not saying that every penny spent now will produce results, but the stars are advising you to investigate new investments. By the way, a secret will be revealed within the next couple of days. 
CAPRICORN, A confrontation or clash of wills is unlikely to materialise, perhaps because you instinctively see the way out of any difficulty. It is far more likely that family relationships will improve, even though the emotional temperature will be heightened over the next week. AQUARIUS There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and everything is better than it seems. The present gloom is largely a mirage created by the backwards movement of that tricky planet, Mercury. In point of fact, your personal prospects are pretty bright. READ | NIA ‘misreads' blood test as hawala, summons top cardiologist 
GEMINI, The Sun is shedding fresh light on parts of your psyche that other planets fail to reach. I would expect this to be a period which is punctuated by rather strange dreams, themselves the result of mysterious healing processes in your unconscious mind. CANCER One very subtle planetary movement today may have no recognisable results until another week has passed. However, you may like to know now that relationships at work are about to become warmer and more friendly. You may also be lined up for an extra community responsibility. 
LEO, The whole point about today's ambitious, emotional and businesslike lunar alignments is that you will do best by following an entirely un-Leonine course of reserve and caution. The last thing you want is for domestic disagreements to flare up again. 
VIRGO, There is about to be a battle for supremacy between the Moon and Venus, two highly emotional planets. The result may be a certain amount of hysteria, and you may be as responsible for this as anyone else. Keep an eye on reckless and explosive feelings. 
LIBRA, Work away quietly behind the scenes on others' behalf. If you are doing more than your fair share, please don't feel hard done by or exploited. It is your destiny to put in more than you take out at the moment, so it's only to be expected that you might feel unappreciated. 
SCORPIO, The best that can be said about your current stars is that they favour personal pleasures, hedonism and decadence. On the other hand, you usually take your leisure pursuits so seriously that you may pass over certain wild possibilities. What can we say except that you're as complicated as ever! 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll be wearing your affections on your sleeve today. Other people are likely to notice this and certain among them will look to you to provide them with security. Your emotional associates will be trying to turn you into some sort of mother hen. 
CAPRICORN, You have spent too much time pondering the future. Now perhaps you should get on and make it a reality. Jupiter and Saturn are about to link up with other planets to form another key relationship in your long-term cycle, one which could shake you to your foundations. AQUARIUS No one can tell you more about yourself than you. Yet you often seem determined to ignore the helpful advice that other people offer, even when you are wrong. Listen very carefully now, and notice all those small but significant words of wisdom. 
GEMINI, Sometimes people at home really have to shout to grab your attention, but when you get moving there is no one as efficient, skilled and organised as you. The only question at the moment is will you be prepared to give way to unreasonable demands? CANCER It's a day for short trips and useful meetings. Those of you who have arranged interviews and other meetings for today can afford to congratulate yourselves on your deep foresight. It's also an ideal moment for counting your cash, piling up profits for the future. 
LEO, You're in a strong position today, and I don't think anyone will get the better of you. But I am afraid that you have no option but to deal with financial trivia. I must say that if you ignore essential details now you may find that your costs increase quite unnecessarily over the coming months. 
VIRGO, The Moon lines up with Mercury and Venus, but in different ways. I'm telling you this just to let you know that at least three planets are working in your favour and therefore that your deeper interests are being protected. You'll combine enthusiasm with practical skill, so there's no excuse for failure. 
LIBRA, Only rarely are you afforded the chance to expand your horizons. Yet, when the opportunity does come, you need to know how to respond. Personal matters may now work out for the best if you are able to build on existing skills and past experience. 
SCORPIO, You must be prepared to consider certain long-term plans and not become bogged down by short-term pressures. However, even now, you should not allow yourself to be bulldozed into rash decisions. Partners need to learn that you are your own person, not an extension of their egos. 
SAGITTARIUS, It looks as if somebody is going to pile on the pressure at work. In addition, you must still complete certain tasks at home. It is a simple matter to reconcile such conflicting demands, just as long as you decide what is truly important and what you can leave up to other people. 
CAPRICORN, A rather disturbing or distressing phase should now lie well and truly in the past. Your planets are thankfully helping you to heal old wounds and create the personal conditions necessary for a happy future. And a happy future, incidentally, will be a busy one. AQUARIUS I am sure that other people have made you hot under the collar, probably because they don't seem capable of making up their minds or following through the implications of their decisions. But, as far as family relationships are concerned, you may be a little perplexed. 
GEMINI, There is little change in your personal stars from yesterday so don't expect too many interesting developments. On the other hand, you should appreciate the opportunity to carry on with tasks you've already begun, without any new hassles. And a relationship could continue to hit you in the pocket. CANCER Your monetary situation still seems to be a determining factor, but rather than concentrate on the minute of finances it may be worth looking at the psychological dimension. You should always be aware of your deep need for material security and underlying fear of poverty. READ | RBI funds transfer: Govt member wanted more, Jalan panel said no 
LEO, Much depends on how you cope with provocative actions or statements by people in authority. The last thing you want to do is irritate someone unnecessarily. If you've kept your cool until now, you should get through with a minimum of fuss or disruption. 
VIRGO, Your intuition is quite remarkable at the moment with the result that you have a much better idea of what is really going on than anyone else. All the better to deal with the questions raised by an important emotional tie, and to begin to heal an old scar. 
LIBRA, Recent emotional tiffs have stirred up forgotten undercurrents. They have also made you see that partners are not going to let you off the hook so easily. However, you are adept at playing the games demanded by any relationship and will never be caught out. At least not unless you want to be! Opinion | In Srinagar lockdown, how a reporter gets news of his sister's miscarriage 
SCORPIO, The Sun is steadily moving towards a confrontation with Pluto, a celestial fact of no little significance for all you Scorpios. May I take this opportunity to advise you to be one hundred percent straight and open in all your dealings? Oh, and never bend the rules. 
SAGITTARIUS, The combination of lunar emotion with Sagittarian energy is one which is bound to galvanize your soul. Overseas contacts and foreign travel are so well indicated that there can be no better way to use your time than to plan your next major expedition. 
CAPRICORN, Although you may be in peak condition, the Moon has knocked the stuffing out of you emotionally in the past. Now you are facing entirely more routine considerations, the chief of which is money. You'll find that older partners and people you've known for a long time will be the most reliable. AQUARIUS The distant rumblings you hear over financial matters must make you realize that decisions cannot be delayed much longer. In a sense your dilemma is that even while the information you have to work with is still uncertain, firm action is required. Get partners on your side now and they won't be able to criticize you later. READ | Power Velocity Sindhu: Next few years could be dominated by the Indian shuttler 
GEMINI, Today's planetary movements suggest a lively, restless atmosphere. Don't forget one facet of your intellectual make-up that other people often overlook, namely your creative ability to string fascinating ideas together in a way that lesser mortals often miss. CANCER Although you're still concerned by the state of an old friendship, financial affairs look increasingly important. Your plans will be dominated by what you can afford. Even intimate personal relationships will be affected by your degree of debt or solvency. READ | Govt could use RBI excess funds for big capital push in time of slowdown: Top official 
LEO, Buoyant planetary influences set you up for the rest of the week. You'll be in control at home, so now is the time to put a few people straight about a number of vital domestic issues. Partners are full of bright ideas, but that doesn't mean that they're right. You can compromise over the details, but not the principle. 
VIRGO, The week's stars are generally auspicious but there is a real possibility at the moment of saying more than is necessary. Look carefully at what each situation warrants and try to respond as you think fit. The best thing you can do now is give someone else the benefit of the doubt. 
LIBRA, There can be few Librans who are not overdrawn or have time to make up for, after last week's intriguing lunar alignments. Do not be concerned if the position is still highly unsatisfactory. At least difficult circumstances will ease within the next fortnight. ALSO READ | To fly Amit Shah, Kargil hero fakes mail, BSF opens probe 
SCORPIO, Mercury, planet of communication, is maintaining its challenging position all week. There are times when you feel as if you're being pushed against your will. Therefore, if at all possible, please refrain from signing on the dotted line or otherwise finalizing arrangements until next week. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you're feeling withdrawn or introverted, the cause may lie somewhere at work, or in another random or routine commitment. By this I mean that professional stresses and strains may make you rather fed up and inclined to change direction - and go your own way. 
CAPRICORN, Recent events will have almost certainly clarified your professional intentions. However, it may not be until the week is out that you have the chance to make the desired moves. Family spending will prove beneficial, and you may manage to make a small profit. READ | Amid J&amp;K lockdown, administration cranks up machinery for UTs AQUARIUS You may have lost the battle but you will go on to win the war. To extend the military metaphor, you must now re-group your forces and wait until the moment returns when it is safe to strike. There is, by the way, a danger that your relationships will be affected when your fantasies overwhelm the facts. 
GEMINI, No one can deny that you have kept your emotions in check, but to be so restrained may not be in your best interests. On the other hand, with Mercury, your personal ruler, still in such an awkward mood, there seems to be little you can realistically do to explain yourself at the moment. Hang on a little while longer. CANCER There is no need to dread Monday. The fact that the Moon begins the week in a helpful position, gets you off to a flying start. A sudden obstacle should not put you off - as long as you are prepared. Self-control and self-discipline, in other words, are the keys to success. 
LEO, Not all is as it should be. Or is it? The fact is that, for as long as the Moon holds its current position, the facts are likely to be concealed by a veil of watery emotion and raw sensitivity. Actually, it's good to temper your self-centred goals with a dose of selfless compassion. 
VIRGO, There is everything to be gained from indulging in sociable activities, especially if you are taking an organizational role. In fact, if you don't look after the practical details, other people may be left completely and utterly helpless! You see, someone is relying on you. 
LIBRA, A magnificent relationship between the Sun and several other planets is excellent for all of you in the property market, just as long as you keep your cool. Domestic spending of all shades and hues is recommended, mainly because you seem to be able to pick out a good bargain. 
SCORPIO, I know there have been times when you've had a rough ride. If there's one thing you are entitled to now, it's a fair hearing and, with the Sun so intriguingly aligned with Uranus, that's just what you can hope for. In fact, I'd say that the results could confound your expectations. 
SAGITTARIUS, I am pleased to report that after months of decidedly wobbly financial indications your stars are now moving in a definitively prosperous direction. If last week's lunar patterns didn't demonstrate this much, this week's fascinating Solar relationships will. 
CAPRICORN, Sometimes you can rely on partners to stand by you. Sometimes you can't. Both at home and at work rivals are changing tack and the opposition is beginning to crumble. However, today you will have to use all your wiles if you are to get everything that you want out of close colleagues. AQUARIUS Battle-lines have been drawn, though not very clearly. In fact, the goalposts seem to be moving and I doubt very much whether either you or anyone else will be able to bring differences of opinion to a successful conclusion. You know, it may be okay to disagree. 
GEMINI, A brilliant relationship between Mercury, ruler of bright ideas, and a number of other vital planets, should make all awkward decisions that much easier to take. Hopefully, close relations will rally round to give you all the extra support and assistance that you need in the present circumstances. CANCER Jupiter, the most helpful of all the planets, is in the crucial stages of its twelve-year cycle, much to your deep satisfaction. This could explain why you now feel as if you are on the brink of something big,in spite of, or perhaps because of, everything that has happened since last year. 
LEO, A new personal astrological phase is beginning, so see this as an ideal time t make an entirely fresh start. You are probably ready for a change, especially in your romantic situation. Why is it, you may wonder, that other people see consistently able to misunderstand your hopes and aspirations. 
VIRGO, The continuing presence of that powerful planetary trio, Uranus, Neptune an Pluto, in inspiring regions of your chart, is bound to make your emotional life rather complex. You have two choices: either you may battle against your man contradictory impulses and desires, or you may happily go along with whatever happen. 
LIBRA, This may be a tricky time of year for other people, but not for you. True, you will be under some pressure both at home and at work, yet Jupiter's presence offers you powerful protection. You will be able to apply your unbeatable balancing act to apparently irreconcilable problems, making everybody happy in the process. 
SCORPIO, You may have encountered annoying delays for quite some time now and, as result, your inner equilibrium may have been upset: such is the effect of the deep and compulsive planet Pluto. However, this week's dynamic planetary picture suits you down to the ground, so you should have hope in your heart. 
SAGITTARIUS, As a Sagittarian, you must have become aware of the fact that you have much i common with Gemini, your opposite sign, including your reluctance to settle down. Now you share something else as well: your concern with money. It could even be time to forge a positive new financial partnership. In love, play it cool. 
CAPRICORN, You might now feel that the odds are stacked against you yet, although you are facing a number of problems, the truth is that you are doing rather well. I there is any problem at all, then it is a partner's pessimism, their tendency always to look on the worst side of things. You need to enthuse other people with the sense that success is only a short step away.

There will be so much for you to enjoy, experience and achieve, now that the planets are focusing on your sign. Spectacular celestial aspects will surely guide and protect you, enabling you to readily accept all the many changes now taking place in both personal relationships an at work. 
GEMINI, This could be a great day for fiddling around at home, completing chores of no great consequence. I have to report that, unexciting as this prospect may be, if you stick to practical pursuits then you will leave yourself spare time for pleasure later on.

LIBRA, A number of planets are lined up in generally positive formations. Venus, that most graceful and charming celestial body, is now coming to your aid, making your day-to-day affairs that much more pleasant. Even the tiniest activities can be enjoyable.

SCORPIO, It is indeed a fine moment to indulge in practical chores and tasks, especially if you're teaming up with other people. Family activities are favoured, as are casual and low-key social gatherings. There also seems to be a secret romance on the horizon, or perhaps other feelings that are difficult to admit to. 
SAGITTARIUS, Do not let a minor matter depress you. Rather than dwelling on secret problems, you should set about tackling them with all the practical skill and experience at your disposal. You must seek expert assistance where necessary, consulting the people who have been there and done that! READ | Opposition leaders head to Srinagar today, J&amp;K authorities say don't disturb 
CAPRICORN, Opportunities for progress and growth are often disguised as challenges which at first seem to be nothing more than difficulties or problems. However, such situations should be seen as the grit which produces the pearl in the oyster, creating emotional riches. AQUARIUS You may devote a little extra time and energy to spending and investments, no matter how small or apparently unimportant. Social engagements will be most enjoyable if they are of a slightly traditional, restrained nature: the old ways are the best ways! 
GEMINI, Ambitious Geminians are now well into a phase which emphasises the role of personal contacts. This means, as the old cliche runs, that who you know is at least as important as what you know, if not more so. Still, if there are people who are prepared to help you, you're fortunate indeed. CANCER You have every right to be hopeful. Wise and intelligent person that you are, you should be the one to offer an olive branch and hold out the hand of friendship. Your financial questions should now have been answered, so if you still don't have the relevant information, get on with it!

LEO, Financial matters are about to grab the headlines, not in any dramatic sense, just in the form of routine affairs that must be dealt with now before they get any worse. Keep up to date with all bills and loans, before you suddenly find that you've let someone down. 
VIRGO, Venus' motion today may not have immediate personal consequences. However, within the week, you should become aware of new feelings, especially of a romantic nature. You will learn to appreciate qualities in loved ones that once annoyed you. ALSO READ | Jammu: MoS's brother, Opposition brass confined to their homes, cops outside 
LIBRA, Please avoid all forms of intrigue and unconventional behaviour. This is a moment to keep your head below the parapet and stay away from risky situations. Peace and quiet are of the essence, for you need to recharge your batteries and restore your morale. 
SCORPIO, You must be prepared to involve colleagues and associates in your plans. Within an overall context of goodwill and co-operation you should now be able to make the most of your emotional intensity, determination and unparalleled leadership qualities. 
SAGITTARIUS, As the days pass you may begin to plan your financial future. Clean up your act - this doesn't mean spending less, but better - and paying more attention to the facts. It's all a question of finding a lifestyle which suits you. Ultimately, though, it is your emotional welfare which counts.

CAPRICORN, There's a lot on your mind, there's no doubt about that. It looks as if someone is trying hard to pressurise you into making an early decision. However, you may smile and ignore their protestations. You will be on top in all discussions, negotiations and meetings. AQUARIUS An unexpected turn of events may prompt you to alter plans or even change the whole direction of your life. The important consideration from your point of view is to take the initiative rather than wake up and discover that fate has taken your decisions for you. 
GEMINI, Financial muddles may only have added to the general air of confusion, yet there does seem to be considerable hope that matters are about to improve. The answer may lie in new partnerships, perhaps with people who are prepared to back you rather than find fault at every turn. CANCER Everything that happens to you, and most of your responses, should be seen as part of a larger pattern. Unlikely events may be viewed as stepping stones to a brighter, happier, freer future. You are still juggling a variety of possibilities, so understand that complications are inevitable. READ | INX Media case: P Chidambaram is arrested, appeals to court's conscience 
LEO, The Sun, which always has a significant role in your life, is helping you develop certain of your more adventurous aspirations. In short, it's a superb time to organise an overseas trip, or explore ideas and beliefs which are very different from those you've accepted in the past. 
VIRGO, Mercury's current motion brings various possibilities to the fore. One is the need to develop your mind by taking up new interests. Another concerns the pleasure and stimulation you will receive from foreign travel, or from contacts with people from distant places.

LIBRA, Why don't you back your instincts and hunches to the hilt? True, other people will have useful things to say, but looking at the next few days it becomes clear that you will have to keep your own counsel. Perhaps partners are just not ready to hear what you have to say. 
SCORPIO, Your planetary rulers, Mars and Pluto, are locking horns. This is a sign that there is a great need for compromise. You may be correct to stand your ground over matters of principle, but equally right to be diplomatic over the details. It could be in your best interests to find some sort of amicable solution. 
SAGITTARIUS, You may still feel as if you're riding an emotional roller-coaster, although it now seems as if recent planetary storms are dying down. Why don't you stand back and attempt to take a critical and dispassionate look at your deeply-held attitudes and opinions? 
CAPRICORN, This week's planetary patterns, notably the intense relationship between Mars and Pluto, are of the kind that can rock the boat and make you feel slightly nervous about the future. Don't worry, though. Your trust has certainly not been misplaced. READ | First reforms to check dodgy doctorates: no degrees for monitors AQUARIUS If you run into any problems with a partner or loved one, don't blame the world at large or retreat behind a mask, giving the impression that you don't care. Pretending that you don't feel as you do could serve no purpose, so be honest about your desires. 
GEMINI, The Moon offers a series of opportunities, but you don't have to take them! In other words, promises may not be translated into action. You should probably make more effort to seize the initiative and compensate for other people's unwillingness to get to grips with practical tasks. CANCER You are responsible for your own success. Every current opportunity stems from events which took place six months ago. Those of you with long memories will realise that current stress levels date back even further. It's time to smile and get on with positive plans. READ | Mobiles down, Valley queues up for landlines 
LEO, Your purpose is to maintain peace. Arguments and disputes can be avoided. Quite frankly, this is one of those times when people who have no self-control create havoc but individuals with a mission to fulfill will make great strides. Hopefully, that includes you. 
VIRGO, Although the Sun is advising you to clinch deals, build your future prosperity and feather your own nest, Mercury is about to focus your attention on higher matters, making you wonder whether it is right to be so self-interested. Perhaps you should aid other people before helping yourself. 
LIBRA, The choice is yours but, if you know what's good for you, you'll continue to stick to principles over cash and career matters. Compromise and flexibility are all very well, but you don't want to be pushed completely off course. Other people need to know that you really do mean business. ALSO READ | INX Media case: Chidambaram bail denied, ED &amp; CBI knock on his door 
SCORPIO, Some offers have seemed irresistible, but perhaps you were right to hold out for better terms. In a sense, it's your attitude that counts more than the outcome. This is because what this current period is all about is personal growth and self-understanding rather than a material benefit. 
SAGITTARIUS, Loved ones or close companions may be unreasonable, but there are ways to escape from emotional tension. What you can do, is making a conscious decision to treat all differences of opinion in a mature, calm and rational manner - and never lose your cool. 
CAPRICORN, Mercury, the planet of the mind and all forms of communication, is gradually altering its position for the better. All those differences of opinion at home should become less important, and you'll soon find it easier to put your ideas across in other related areas. READ | Chandrayaan-2: Milestone now, moon in sight AQUARIUS Your natural intuitive abilities are in excellent working order but, to feel their benefit, you need to banish all that mental clutter and allow your mind to relax. Only then will important hunches and long-term dreams succeed in attracting your attention. 
GEMINI, You have been through some fascinating personal periods recently, yet somewhere along the line you will begin to appreciate that your real blessings in life are much more valuable and lasting than fame, fortune and adulation. Your greatest treasures are your friends, the people who have stood by you through thick and thin. CANCER Passions run high today. Many people will be involved in direct confrontations, yet there is no reason why you should not turn tough planetary energies to your advantage. You'd do well to avoid financial speculation, and try to get other people to be clear about their intentions. READ | Trump dials PM Modi who calls out Imran: His anti-India talk doesn't help peace 
LEO, Some partners and close associates still appear to be out of sorts although, if I might venture an opinion, it does seem that these people are singularly failing to make the most of their potential. Rather than listening to their moans, why don't you try and offer them some practical encouragement? 
VIRGO, You're quite a worrier, but try taking a deep breath and counting to ten whenever your security is threatened. Your romantic stars are likely to bring intrigue, mystery and possibly an element of confusion, as well as fond memories of the past. 
LIBRA, You have some delicate choices to make. You are more than usually aware who you may trust and who must be kept in their place. Don't let people influence your judgment over public or professional matters unless they are fully familiar with all the circumstances, otherwise you may get misleading advice. ALSO READ | Khayyam Hashmi: ‘He created songs and melodies like a craftsman carves wood and stone' 
SCORPIO, A shake-up or showdown is about to take place, mainly because Mars is setting up a great deal of friction with Pluto. However, it will no doubt be a good move to clear the air, allowing everyone to get complaints off their chests, and perhaps to see that they were mistaken. 
SAGITTARIUS, Wipe the slate clean now and put domestic irritations to one side. You are entering a phase which may include a few downs, but is generally likely to be much more enjoyable than usual. You must try not to be so reserved, for if you don't let people know what you're feeling, how can they ever understand you? READ | Five Ministers are special guests at first Express Governance Awards 
CAPRICORN, If you could ever find the balance between your personal interests and those of your friends and associates, you'd be a happy person. At least you should now be able to achieve a better balance with lovers, spouses and anyone with whom you're intimately involved. AQUARIUS A celestial adventure is beginning, though you may require something of a kick-start to push you into action. Keep an eagle eye open for storm clouds at work. For some reason certain people in authority seem to be in a singularly bad mood. 
GEMINI, In spite of your open and chatty reputation you are about to enter a more secretive phase, one when peace, quiet and seclusion will be of increasing importance to your general well-being. But, just for now, you still need to indulge your creative or pleasurable instincts. CANCER You've got a long memory - a very long one indeed! In many ways you are still dealing with the legacy of the distant past. Yet, although it's inevitable that you should feel nostalgia for what has been, you would be advised to get on with planning the future. 
LEO, There seems to be a great deal going on which is difficult, if not downright impossible, to explain. You may have to accept the fact that it might be another few days before a number of questions can be answered. Still, you've got the time, so be patient. Read our top story today: Detained in Jammu &amp; Kashmir: Ex-top ministers, MLAs, Mayor 
VIRGO, You should now be back on form and determined to alter the pattern of your life. Lunar aspects may be raising stress levels but they also offer you the opportunity to form new relationships and emphasise the neglected social dimension. Besides which, there are many steps you can take to reduce tension. 
LIBRA, Current challenging planetary aspects may put your nose out of joint but, then, you're such a perfectionist that it doesn't take much to disturb your equilibrium. The Sun's passage through a challenging region of your chart demonstrates the simple truth that the answer may lie in someone else's hands. 
SCORPIO, You're heading for a pleasant romantic phase. Relations with children and younger family members are set to improve and cultural pursuits are likely to take up more of your time. However, you're still unwilling to show your feelings, and your secrecy could be the cause of occasional misunderstandings.

SAGITTARIUS, You should keep your options open this week and do everything you can to bring underlying tensions into the fresh air. As a matter of interest, it does seem essential that you make it a priority to deal with financial issues: there's an outside chance that you could be over-charged.  
CAPRICORN, The odds may be stacked against you today. Yet do not despair - all is not lost. It may be time for one of those clever tactical retreats that results in your position being stronger than ever. Perhaps it's also the right moment to call somebody's bluff. AQUARIUS Even if you're an ambitious professional Aquarian, family and domestic affairs will assume a high priority. At work you'll find other people looking to you for security, irritating as it may be to feel that you're being depended upon by people who should know better. 
GEMINI, Hold on there! You may be about to make a rash promise or a sudden emotional commitment. Such things always require an extra second or two's thought, especially when other people seem to understand what's going on better than you, difficult though it may be to admit as much! Also, now is a fine moment to pay more attention to your health and fitness regime. CANCER It seems that you are only prepared to do your best when your goal is self-fulfilment, and financial considerations or blind obedience to the rules will play little part in achieving your ambitions. You're on a very important long-term cycle, and it will pay to follow your own course both now and over the next four months. 
LEO, This is really a rather fine moment for all competitive and sporting Leos and, no matter whether your preferences are personal or professional, there's much to be said for playing to win. The satisfaction should lie in knowing that you've beaten your previous personal best. Even family members will be relieved if you set out to implement long-term improvements.

VIRGO, Your stars are moving on and, conveniently enough, this is one of the best times of the year for tackling domestic arrangements. This doesn't mean, by the way, that everything should work out exactly as planned, but that in all personal matters your success rate may be higher than expected. That, in itself, could cheer you up! 
LIBRA, The Moon now indicates that this is a pleasant period for small-talk and chit-chat. However, there are also more profound movements in your chart and, given that major questions concerning career or other worldly ambitions are still unresolved, you should consider spending a little extra time pondering the future.

SCORPIO, According to your planets, there's a ninety percent chance of a personal misunderstanding. What can you do about this? Make sure that one hundred percent of the time you take the maximum effort to make yourself clear. Plus, in matters of the heart, a little generosity will become you. Also, be sceptical about a cash offer that is too good to be true. 
SAGITTARIUS, You are about to have that strange sense of deja vu. Everything that happens now may be, at least in some senses, a repeat of events which took place over the whole of the past month. The difference is that this time you can make up for any unfortunate mistakes you committed last time around! You've a major opportunity to correct a personal error. 
CAPRICORN, You may get the distinct impression that someone is trying to prise information out of you, or force you to make a commitment before you are ready. Appearances, though, can be misleading and the real issue is your ongoing desire for secrecy. Mind you, you might have perfectly good reasons for keeping certain thoughts to yourself! AQUARIUS You seem set to dive into a preliminary round of very satisfying socialising and one particular arrangement should be surprisingly successful. Please do so while the time is right for, very soon, your inclination will be to keep yourself to yourself! Financial decisions, by the way, must be taken in conjunction with those they directly affect. A social engagement is surprisingly successful. 
GEMINI, Travel plans may still be interrupted or delayed by various irritating planetary alignments. Misunderstandings, rather than mechanical failures, are likely to be the root cause of any difficulties. That's why all you have to do is check important arrangements - and then double-check. CANCER Just as long as you have answered those awkward outstanding questions, then your security is assured, so you may put financial cares behind you. Rather, realise that in all areas of your life it is genuinely equal, free and open partnerships which hold the key to future success and happiness.

LEO, Sometimes you relish a battle, but you have suffered enough in the past not to want to put yourself through the mill again. You may therefore decide to draw a veil over recent contentious issues and set out on a fresh and optimistic path. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise! 
VIRGO, On the whole you can congratulate yourself on a successful week. The Moon plays a powerful role, which should bring a feeling of emotional warmth and security to complement your many worldly achievements. Why not appreciate such fortunate stars? PM Modi in Bhutan: Follow LIVE updates here  
LIBRA, Many of you may have felt a sense of euphoria after recent emotional encounters. Others may have been knocked off balance, but you will surely benefit from the creative events which are due to follow. You can loosen up, get back to basics and fulfil a childhood dream.  Also read | Kumaraswamy got phones of MLAs tapped, says probe, CM calls for report 
SCORPIO, The weekend may not be the best time to deal with professional complications, unless you're a workaholic. It's probably far better to turn your hand to those family and home opportunities which have arisen over the last two or three days and enjoy a new leisure attraction. 
SAGITTARIUS, You'll probably experience a shift of mood around midday as the Moon switches positions and adjusts its emotional power over your psyche. This may prompt a change in your plans, but do keep other people informed, otherwise you can't blame them if they don't give you whole-hearted backing. 
CAPRICORN, Get financial business out of the way this morning. The Moon now urges you to put such mundane business aside and think about what you really want to do. You can ponder your long-term future, and consult younger relations as to what they think should happen next. Read | Maharashtra: In Marathwada, govt plans Rs 16,000-crore grid for piped water AQUARIUS There's still some confusion over major plans. Although you may still not be able to travel as you would wish, or you might have to postpone an important agreement, it will be worth your while to continue along your current course, just as long as you ask the right questions. 
GEMINI, Your classic Geminian qualities are in demand today - especially an ability to bring the rigours of logical analysis to muddled situations, to face the facts and set current situations in their context for people who lack your feel for the truth. Also read | Signals aplenty that slowdown is spreading across India Inc CANCER Don't worry so much about money - remember that, as long as you make a tiny profit, no matter how small, nothing too bad can happen. By the way, the current mood of nostalgia is taking you down some interesting romantic paths. You could enjoy a sentimental journey. 
LEO, The planets are hitting you with everything they've got, which means that you have little choice but to go in and do your best! Hesitate now and you may find a personal opportunity slips from your grasp. But, remember, if someone would make a better ally than enemy, get them on your side. Read | ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 reaches key stage, what next? 
VIRGO, You are still enjoying secret developments. Most should be totally harmless, if not downright favourable. You may soon learn something spectacular from pondering the mysterious spiritual nature of your existence. A spot of navel-gazing could be just what you need! 
LIBRA, Your celestial alignments are now beginning to intensify, and one or two energetic people may stroll into your life. You may feel nurtured at a rather fundamental emotional level, and really there is no need to worry too much about your security. But do take the normal steps to safeguard your position. Read | A Karnataka survival story: Couple stayed on roof, tree for three days 
SCORPIO, It may be your professional cares or hopes which are dominating the news, or it could be a partner's. Either way, you might have to shelve certain family or domestic questions, no matter how pressing they may be. Then you'll give yourself more time to find out what is really happening. 
SAGITTARIUS, On the face of it, today's general mood is difficult and unpredictable. Yet look below the surface and you should see that you're being pushed towards much greater self-fulfilment. That's important, because once you understand your motives you'll make the right arrangements. 
CAPRICORN, Life is still hectic, yet today the issues are once again narrowed down to money. Have you got enough? Do you need more? And, if so, what for? These are all deeply practical issues that could affect long-term decisions, and could have a bearing on your romantic desires. AQUARIUS Please put personal rivalries to one side, otherwise you'll say or do something you'll come to regret. You may turn the other cheek and forgive your enemies,even though such noble behaviour perhaps goes against the grain. If you do take such a selfless course, you'll earn respect from unexpected areas. 
GEMINI, Your lot in life, at the moment, may be rather dull and many Geminians are quite frankly bored. You could do worse than rouse yourself and arrange an adventure, even if only a weekend break, to get away from your routine. There's nothing wrong with being an escapist! CANCER Although, in astrological tradition, adverse and challenging aspects denote times of strife, discord and confusion, you must see such perils as the grit which eventually produces the oyster of great wisdom and success. In other words, you'll rise to the challenge. 
LEO, There is no escaping the fact that tension is mounting, as it always does before the Moon aligns with your sign. You can do no better than consciously maintain an optimistic and tolerant spirit in the face of whatever doubts or irritations afflict your daily life. Also read | Russia urges Pakistan foreign minister to resolve issues with India bilaterally 
VIRGO, Suspicions about other people's actions may be countered by sadness over a recent event. Whatever your personal situation, you are approaching a short period when the answers will only be found by looking within. You'll soon discover the part you played in creating current conditions. 
LIBRA, Nostalgia seems to be an important ingredient at the present time. Many of you will gain from a sentimental trip to the past, not necessarily this week, but hopefully within a month. What you really have to do is recover old feelings and relive glorious memories. 
SCORPIO, Even those lucky Scorpios who are gentlemen or ladies of leisure will be caught up in the general rush to achieve a deeply-held worldly desire. This is no time for regrets or uncertainty, and you should try not to be distracted by irrelevant memories. Also read | Ayodhya hearing: Accounts of foreign travellers, historians establish birthplace claim, SC told 
SAGITTARIUS, Today's stars really are excellent in that they encourage certain key Sagittarian aspirations, notably the instinctive desire for travel and adventure. Be warned, though, that entrenched positions and dogmatic battles are looming, and that you'd better be ready to change your mind. 
CAPRICORN, There is everything to gain from taking a calculated financial risk, just as long as you take full responsibility. Even if you incur a small loss you will have clarified your priorities and personal needs. After all, sometimes you have to learn from your mistakes. AQUARIUS Even peaceable Aquarians are sure to be involved in some sort of fracas over the next week. There may be no other advice than to raise the drawbridge and prepare a defensive position. But, while you're about it, there are other important actions you can take, like acquiring new practical skills. 
GEMINI, Money matters are still to the fore, but now is the time to recognise that enough is enough. Get a grip on your affairs and realise that tradition is more important than strange modern ways of doing things. Also, necessities are a better buy than luxuries. CANCER In many ways it's still a stable, sensible sort of a time. Everything that is most conservative about your character should stand you in good stead today. Emphasise practical solutions and don't give way to anger or resentment over any recent hurts or slights. Also read | Reservoir levels: West well stocked with water, South is short  
LEO, The Sun is still in an intense mood, and could encourage an indication of simmering family tensions. But your first step is to get on and finish worthwhile activities, rather than complaining about why nothing ever seems to work out. Optimistic Leos should set about domestic repairs without delay. 
VIRGO, Social contacts should again be emphasised today, but with a difference. The significant relationships will be those with people who are older, more experienced or more secure than you. Wild spending and extravagance will solve nothing, unless having too much money is a problem. 
LIBRA, The costs of a recent responsibility, perhaps a social obligation, may have alarmed you. However, it looks as if you may have very little alternative but to smile and settle up. But perhaps what's really important is the emotional cost, and all that's needed are a few soothing words. Also read | Construction in Amaravati comes to a grinding halt 
SCORPIO, Even though your life recently has been all about maintaining balance and following the middle way, you may now feel able to swing to extremes. If you take a risk and abandon your normal belief in harmony, then you'll soon see what happens to your chosen long-term plans. 
SAGITTARIUS, Today's intriguing developments favour a solution to your business cares and financial woes. The answer lies in long-term investments and savings, not in making a fast buck, going for a quick fix or indulging in any risky enterprise. An older acquaintance could have the best advice. Read | J&amp;K: Amid restrictions, chemists say medicine stocks running low 
CAPRICORN, Even those of you whose life is moving at break-neck speed should slow down today, or at least consolidate the gains you've made so far. Anything that is not secure may be swept away by the long-running dispute between macho Mars and electrifying Uranus. AQUARIUS Risk a confrontation only if you are perfectly happy to incur certain losses. These may be financial or professional but are more likely to relate to a family partnership. Otherwise keep your head down and avoid trouble, while people around you calm down. 
GEMINI, The way out of current financial complications is twofold. First, you can attempt to run your affairs in a traditional manner. Secondly, you may realise that your fortunes are linked to other people's and make teamwork your priority. You can even offer them a helping hand. CANCER Events are moving very fast, and will continue to do so for the next month. The problem is that a great deal that happens may seem to be outside your control. Yet if you are honest, you'll see that you laid the seeds of current crises - and triumphs - over the last twelve months. READ | J&amp;K move won't impact Line of Control or Line of Actual Control: India to China 
LEO, The crucial factor today is the planets' desire to stir up mysteries and confusion, a factor which leads you away from everything of worldly significance, towards solitude, charity, imagination and dreams. You may therefore feel a little out of touch with certain daily duties. 
VIRGO, You're not usually interested in small talk, yet I would advise you to do whatever is necessary to mix as widely as possible, no matter how unpromising social contacts seem. Eventually, something of value will emerge from a new relationship, if only you can wait! 
LIBRA, Home entertaining and family engagements are favoured all week. Some may be pleasurable, some may be called to deal with knotty problems and awkward business. If it's agreement you're after, remember that where there's a will there's a way. In other words, it's all up to you! EXPLAINED | Why lower fiscal deficit isn't always good news 
SCORPIO, Excellent, intuitive and commonsense lunar aspects should put you on the right track today. The beneficial impact will be felt primarily on your instincts, those mysterious Scorpionic feelings which are responsible for guiding you through life's many minor perils. 
SAGITTARIUS, Money worries resurface today, but those of you who have already decided to do something positive about your situation will take a further step towards greater prosperity. The general drift of events this week is supportive, so don't falter now. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon takes up a powerful position, raising your confidence but also indicating that your intuitions are on top form. This has two consequences. On the one hand, you will be very sensitive to the fact that partners' interests must be respected. On the other, you will be challenged to broaden the scope of your own activities. ALSO READ | Sorry girls, no new dress, no ice cream. Eid Mubarak AQUARIUS This is a lively day and everyone seems to want more than they can have. An unforeseen obstacle brings the greatest risk of a clash but, in some strange way, the consequence of any irrational disagreement could be a deeper insight into your real aims and options. 
GEMINI, Mercury, your ruling planet, is combining poetic beauty with a truly profound sense of practical possibilities. You can express whatever you want to say in the way you want to say it. It all looks pretty nostalgic as well! Just about right for the perfect day. Don't spoil it. CANCER The odds certainly seem to be stacked against you this week, but I am confident that after recent experiences you can cope with just about anything. If you still see yourself as a soft little Cancer, stop it now. There are few people as tough as you when roused. Read | India, China foreign ministers to meet today 
LEO, The Moon's current position in your chart is something of a special event. This simple fact means that you have every chance to implement whatever major improvements in your life have been brewing over the past year. But, and this is a big ‘but', you must obtain partners' support. 
VIRGO, Influences over your creative fifth house bring us back to a theme which has been raising its head time after time over the past two years - the need to feel that you are doing something meaningful with your life, not just drifting along with the herd. 
LIBRA, If you're one of those Librans who is absolutely happy with where you're living, you're in a tiny minority. Most of you, even those who have moved home recently, are still in a state of domestic uncertainty. That's a sign that there could be further improvements to come.

SCORPIO, There's something delightful about your serious-minded determination to ferret out the truth. Now that you're finding it easier to say what's on your mind, other people will at last have the chance to benefit from your wonderfully profound fund of wisdom. 
SAGITTARIUS, The entire week is overshadowed by the emphatic and unambiguous relationship between the Sun and the Moon - in a profoundly positive sense. This will be entirely in your favour, and will encourage you to take whatever steps are necessary to better yourself. 
CAPRICORN, You're still in the middle of a period of personal revolution that at times mirrors the dramatic changes on the global scene. Only another Capricorn will truly understand your dilemma. And only another Capricorn can understand how you need to re-arrange your finances. AQUARIUS If you know what's good for you, you'll devote a great deal of attention to making sure that loved ones and colleagues are perfectly happy with your behaviour. You may lavish presents and attention on those whose favour you are seeking. You might get exactly the desired reaction!

GEMINI, In view of the fact that work and money are due to be increasingly powerful factors in your chart in the near future, you would be advised to have a break now and take advantage of what are frankly very strong social trends over the next two weeks. You really do need to get out and about - you know it makes sense! CANCER Your planetary movements are set to prove extremely helpful over coming weeks. Your most useful course of action now is to secure allies and supporters wherever and whenever you can. Above all, you must bend over backwards to explain your point of view, for it's no use expecting other people to read your mind. 
LEO, You should be in a relatively adventurous mood. If you are able to sense coming developments you may also be aware that what is happening now is more dependent on financial considerations than you once realised. Even romantic hopes rely on the size of your wallet! Pay more attention to details at work before you get caught out! 
VIRGO, In an emotional sense, a new phase is beginning and, now that both Mercury and Venus are moving along very nicely, you can look forward to a week which should be more confident, extroverted and, hopefully, fulfilling than has sometimes been the case. It's about time you had some good news! Also, remember that your stars help you best when you also help yourself. 
LIBRA, I know you know this, but it still needs to be said: you must understand that partners need to have their say. The moment you try to make everything run smoothly, the reverse will happen, so don't be afraid if a relationship frays around the edges. Instead, appreciate the resulting sense of excitement: every cloud has a silver lining. 
SCORPIO, If it's love you're interested in, you can afford to be hopeful. Venus, the bringer of affection, is in a choosy mood and indicates that whatever your circumstances, your demeanour is about to improve. Much depends on the cultivation of a generous spirit, for sensitive people will respond well to magnanimous gestures. 
SAGITTARIUS, From now on, two sections of your chart stand out in bold relief: those ruling home and money. It goes without saying that you are therefore entering a period which favours domestic spending. Everyone moving home, or even just moving the furniture, should proceed with confidence and high hopes. Keep a practical perspective and always check the details. 
CAPRICORN, Mercury, the planet associated with ideas, thought and smooth communication, is now at its most influential, inaugurating a two-week period during which you must strive to explain yourself as never before. Above all, be honest about your true desires: if you're not straight with yourself, you will never be straight with others. AQUARIUS It's time to look ahead, peering into the future. You must begin to consider the financial consequences of your actions. Perhaps more important, though, is the need to question the value judgments which have been shaping your personal relationships for good or ill. It's time to take control! Take the lead now and you will be able to relax later on. 
GEMINI, You are not the type to compromise, yet when Venus forms a supportive relationship with your sign, this is just what you must do. It's much better to be tactful now, than live to eat your words later. You will do yourself a favour if you keep out of a dispute between partners. CANCER For someone who is so sensitive you can also be remarkably tough, a contradiction which often bemuses your loved ones and perplexes your friends. Over the present period both these qualities are essential if you are to succeed. Stick to the facts for a change! Also read | Under cover of night, ailing try to find way to Srinagar hospitals 
LEO, For weeks now you have been fighting an uphill battle. One of your complaints is that a particular person, or people, has been concealing information from you. Whether this has been deliberate or not is another matter. And that is what you have to work out before you take another step. 
VIRGO, What is fair in one context may not be so in another. Therefore it's up to you to be flexible and meet partners half way. Your reputation will receive a boost if you are seen to do the right thing. Your stars are looking better and better as the days pass, in spite of rising tension. 
LIBRA, Boredom is not often one of your problems, partly because you're always on your toes expecting a disaster of one kind or another. However, this will be a quiet weekend unless you are actively disturbed by other people. And, if you are, try to placate them as quickly as you can.

SCORPIO, Don't capitulate to unfair pressure just yet. Help has arrived in the form of Venus, one of the most beneficial of the planets. From now on, you will discover the virtues of true friendship. It's not always easy for you to reveal your deeper feelings - but do have a go. It might do you good! 
SAGITTARIUS, You simply cannot let up now, just when the Sun and Venus are aiding your sign. Weary as you may be, you are about to find your second wind, and there's no doubt about your ability to win through. You will soon be facing up to a new responsibility - and very successfully, too, may I say. 
CAPRICORN, It seems likely that there will be plenty to interest you in out-of-the-way places and mysterious activities. If you want stimulation, try and make a break with your normal routine - and experiment with change. I know it's difficult, but you shouldn't regret it! AQUARIUS You gave an inch and people expected a mile. Now you want them to reciprocate but you may have a very long wait. One of the lessons you must learn is that other people can be every bit as stubborn as you. That may come as a surprise to you, but not to your friends.

GEMINI, Someone you trust still seems prone to letting you down, or trying to duck out of a commitment. Don't worry. It's all due to Mercury's wonderful motion, one day clearing up all your doubts, the next sowing confusion in your personal and intimate affairs. CANCER You may sometimes wonder why you take such trouble to keep people informed of your plans and intentions when they react with such indifference or ingratitude. Still, they are the losers, not you. And, with that in mind, work out what you can do next. Also read | On the ground at Jammu border with Valley: Protests, hope 
LEO, Perhaps it's because the Sun is your planetary ruler that you take other people's support and loyalty for granted. Yet events of the past few days may have taught you that you have no right to expect to get something for nothing. That's a necessary lesson, I'm afraid! 
VIRGO, All forms of travel and communication are to the fore now, and it seems very much as if you will be getting away for purely social reasons. You can now expect to hear from loved ones who are far away, and the result may be a family gathering or celebration. 
LIBRA, Never forget how important it is to pay credit where credit is due, otherwise you will not be able to rely on partners' sympathy and encouragement in future. You really do have a great deal to be thankful for. For one thing, next year is going to bring unprecedented success in one of your treasured ambitions.

SCORPIO, Financial decisions are looming, as you know only too well. Some time within the next two or three weeks you must decide one way or the other, however attractive different alternatives may seem. You're definitely looking for a way out - but which way is it to be? That is the question! 
SAGITTARIUS, Mercury maintains its helpful alignment with your sign today, good enough reason to arrange interviews, attend important meetings and hold vital discussions. For the next few weeks you will be at your most persuasive, and your words will be backed by rare emotional force. 
CAPRICORN, Since you have already coped with a good deal of adversity in your life, you should be extremely well placed to cope with a problematic planetary picture which is now emerging. Other people may soon be coming to you for advice. You'll have to respond to each case in turn. Also read | Yashwant Singh writes: Once there was a commitment AQUARIUS It's time to shatter a few preconceived ideas and prove just how well you can get on without other people if the need arises. What transpires over the next few days will surely reinforce your confidence. And, once it does so, you will be ready to face the world again. 
GEMINI, Adverse or challenging aspects recently have made you feel that the world has been out to get you. However, the best way to keep your spirits up is to realise that beneath it all people really are on your side. There seems to be some chance of mechanical difficulties around today, so check for problems. CANCER Saturn advises caution and restraint for a little while longer, advice which may not suit your imaginative and ambitious plans. Still, if you allow events to take their own course, your ideas will have time to mature. You may feel as if you're carrying the world on your shoulders. But that just shows how strong you are, doesn't it? Also read | Day after J&amp;K bifurcation bill passed: Pakistan tests Kashmir waters, India holds response 
LEO, Current planetary transits should leave you jumping for joy. The planets are rearranging themselves in such a way that tension and pressure will be relieved while pleasure and enjoyment should be enhanced. A child may be feeling shaken, even though they may not be showing it, so be considerate. 
VIRGO, As the Sun, and then Mercury, align themselves with the angle of your horoscope ruling your home, domestic considerations will become more and more of an issue. Some of you may be considering a move in the near future, or a similar improvement in your home conditions. There is some way to go yet, though. 
LIBRA, Sometimes the planets have to be firm to be kind, and what they are planning now is a change of tack in joint financial affairs. The deadline looms but probably not until next week at the earliest, so you've plenty of time to take the necessary action. Read | Four dead as thousands rush across Assam for fresh NRC hearings 
SCORPIO, Your biggest weakness at the moment may be complacency. Do not relax your guard for one moment, at least not until you are absolutely sure that you are out of danger. Partners may wrongly accuse you of letting them down, but perhaps they should have done more for themselves! 
SAGITTARIUS, You may wait until after tomorrow if you want to broach sensitive emotional issues. Today, you should make sure that partners are prepared to listen to what you are planning to say. Above all, be tolerant. After all, you may just be responsible for the problems you criticise in others. 
CAPRICORN, You may still feel rather isolated, never a pleasant sensation. However, if you are separated from those you love and care for, why not do something about it? You may be surprised by the welcome response you receive. It will be pleasant to discover how popular you are. Also read | No chest-thumping please, long haul ahead: PM Modi's message to party AQUARIUS It may be time to clear away some of the debris that still seems to be cluttering up your life after recent emotional traumas. Focus on professional and career relationships, as these are where you will gain. Remember, if your dreams are to come true, you'll have to pay for them! 
GEMINI, In spite of one or two difficulties, combined with opposition from some partners, events definitely seem to be moving in your direction. Keep your eye firmly on the long-term picture, and don't let short-term distractions push you off course, especially as you're in the right! CANCER The Moon in one of the most potent regions of your chart definitely indicates busy times ahead, just when you were looking forward to a break. A great deal seems to be going on behind the scenes, so you'll have to look under a few stones to get to the truth. Also read | Sushma Swaraj: Foreign minister, most accessible 
LEO, Life may be demanding and hectic but never dull. Today's Lunar pattern brings classic indications that all your Leonine qualities - courage, generosity and creativity - will be allowed to flourish. People who mix with you will be fortunate indeed! 
VIRGO, There doesn't seem to be any way that you can get plans or projects off the ground without the full and unswerving support of partners and colleagues. People in positions of authority will be able to help but, for your part, you must be prepared to follow their advice. 
LIBRA, Since Venus is in a delicate relationship with Uranus you may expect events to work out favourably, even if not in the way that you hoped. It's time to expect a pleasant surprise, although when, where, and how it is to come, is naturally to be a secret for now! Read | Valley has seen many a lockdown but why this time it is so different 
SCORPIO, Venus will oblige you to be more sociable over the coming weeks. You will have to abandon an elitist attitude which has made it difficult to get on with people who may be of help in the future. You will be able to get in touch with somebody from whom you've been separated, next week, by the way. 
SAGITTARIUS, Stop making finances a bone of contention. Part of the trouble seems to be caused by your underlying lack of confidence in your economic security. Until this is dealt with, difficulties will continue. Think clearly, get the facts straight and you'll see just how close you are to success. 
CAPRICORN, At certain times you must put your own interests behind those of other people, including those who are not exactly close friends. Such selflessness now will stand you in good stead in the future. There does seem to be a great deal to gain from a new friendship, but you might have to make the first move. Also read | Mumbai cobbler stitched together a gang to bail out offenders AQUARIUS You may be on the ball, but others still have the ability to make life awkward for you. Perhaps an apology from you for past offence you have given, however unintentionally, will clear the air. A cash crisis should dissolve before your eyes, but only if you stick to your course. 
GEMINI, The current relationship between Jupiter and Saturn is undoubtedly positive, and you should use the opportunity to implement plans which you have been considering for some time but frankly felt were not in your line of business. Oh - and within the month you will have forgotten that certain current problems ever existed. EDITORIAL ON KASHMIR | Historic changes draw an audacious red line across J&amp;K and its compact with the Union CANCER The emotional Moon is now impacting on a sociable area of your horoscope, revealing that you have everything to gain from associations with other people, especially those who are clearly in the know. Even at work you'll have to operate as part of a team. Go it alone and you may do yourself long-term damage. 
LEO, The period you've just been through has not been entirely to your liking. However, every astrological cloud has a silver lining, and very soon the benefits derived from recent upsets will be made plain. In the end you'll decide that the wait was worth it. 
VIRGO, Tensions are building up at home, although there is no reason why this should be considered bad. Anything which forces you to get out of your rut and make improvements is to be welcomed. There seems to be a great deal going in your favour at home, so any difficulties could be a result of your own impatience. ALSO READ | Using Article 370 to scrap Article 370? The legal debate ahead 
LIBRA, You are fortunate to be born under the sign of Venus, a planet which has been affording you a great deal of protection lately. Now, however, you must learn to stand on your own two feet. It's fine to depend on partners sometimes - but not all the time. 
SCORPIO, You may have been sitting on confidential information or keeping a secret on behalf of a friend. However, be prepared for everything to come into the open before the week is out. There is no way that partners will let you off the hook, so you'd better have your story ready. 
SAGITTARIUS, Seeing as there is shortly to be a critical planetary alignment in your sign, you should tread carefully. It's necessary to retain your sense of optimism regarding the future, yet your downfall could be over-confidence. My advice would be to double-check every detail. 
CAPRICORN, Today's lunar positions offer you the strongest possible advice to listen to close partners. You may be astonished at the quality of their ideas, and quite possibly pleasantly surprised by the outcome. Your other planets are pointing the way to monetary success. OPINION | PB Mehta writes: Blood and Betrayal AQUARIUS It will seem terribly unfair when people who hardly know you feel they have the right to comment critically on your behaviour. Yet this is what may happen today and tomorrow, so don't rise to the bait. You'll get everything you need by watching and waiting until the time is right. 
GEMINI, According to tradition this is a strange time of year for you, yet even in adverse circumstances you have much to learn. Indeed, you may even gain from being forced to abandon or modify your normal routine. There is a great deal to be said for keeping your plans to yourself, just for now. CANCER Overall, the planets will maintain a balance of friendly and stressful aspects to your sign this week. Just as Mercury removes itself, making it harder for you to reach agreement, magnificent Venus will step in and implement improvements in your social life.

LEO, Domestic tensions look set to ease, possibly because you have now made, or are about to make, an important choice. You will be happy just as long as friends and relatives concur with your decision. On the other hand, an employer or colleague now needs your trust and understanding. Read | Jammu and Kashmir: Govt looks at land laws to dilute Article 35A 
VIRGO, Over the next few days you may be faced with your last chance to settle a business arrangement or finalise joint spending plans. Circumstances will change very soon, perhaps after a friend moves the goal posts. Just how you react will be very much a matter for you, and partners should keep quiet. 
LIBRA, Take a careful look at your business arrangements and financial commitments. Friends or partners will soon be asking you to account for your actions and it is essential that you have all the figures straight. Even your romantic desires will be dominated by what you can and can't afford. Also read | Ayodhya mediation: Four proposals saw some light till talks failed 
SCORPIO, You've been thinking long and hard about what the next move should be. Until now it has seemed likely that you would have to go it alone, but all that will change when a new and willing partner arrives on the scene. The chance of a cash bonus will excite your hopes. 
SAGITTARIUS, Whatever you feel about life, your mood will have completely altered by the end of the week. In the meantime, pay detailed attention to your financial affairs. You are not alone in feeling the squeeze, so never imagine that you have to face such questions by yourself. Read | Assam districts panic, notices at night for NRC hearings 300 km away 
CAPRICORN, You pride yourself on your honesty, but over the next few days, it will become increasingly clear that you had better keep certain items of information to yourself. Discretion may be the best course, but then that always comes naturally to any true Capricorn. AQUARIUS This may be an increasingly sociable time, largely because of the movement of planets through those angles of your chart denoting public success and acclaim. Do not be afraid to acknowledge those wonderful achievements for which you are responsible. 
GEMINI, In view of the fact that work and money are due to be increasingly powerful factors in your chart in the near future, you would be advised to have a break now and take advantage of what are frankly very strong social trends over the next two weeks. You really do need to get out and about - you know it makes sense! Also read | Coffee and froth: For VG Siddhartha, a lot could happen over coffee CANCER Your planetary movements are set to prove extremely helpful over coming weeks.

Read | Global travel alerts, Opposition urges caution: Valley still grapples with what next 
LEO, You should be in a relatively adventurous mood. If you are able to sense coming developments you may also be aware that what is happening now is more dependent on financial considerations than you once realised. Even romantic hopes rely on the size of your wallet! Pay more attention to details at work before you get caught out! 
VIRGO, In an emotional sense, a new phase is beginning and, now that both Mercury and Venus are moving along very nicely, you can look forward to a week which should be more confident, extroverted and, hopefully, fulfilling than has sometimes been the case. Its about time you had some good news! Also, remember that your stars help you best when you also help yourself. 
LIBRA, I know you know this, but it still needs to be said: you must understand that partners need to have their say. The moment you try to make everything run smoothly, the reverse will happen, so dont be afraid if a relationship frays around the edges. Instead, appreciate the resulting sense of excitement: every cloud has a silver lining. Also read | Maharashtra Police deradicalisation project: Safety net, skills training, bank loans

Venus, the bringer of affection, is in a choosy mood and indicates that whatever your circumstances, your demeanour is about to improve. Much depends on the cultivation of a generous spirit, for sensitive people will respond well to magnanimous gestures. 
SAGITTARIUS, From now on, two sections of your chart stand out in bold relief: those ruling home and money. It goes without saying that you are therefore entering a period which favours domestic spending. Everyone moving home, or even just moving the furniture, should proceed with confidence and high hopes. Keep a practical perspective and always check the details.

Above all, be honest about your true desires: if youre not straight with yourself, you will never be straight with others. AQUARIUS Its time to look ahead, peering into the future. You must begin to consider the financial consequences of your actions. Perhaps more important, though, is the need to question the value judgments which have been shaping your personal relationships for good or ill. Its time to take control! Take the lead now and you will be able to relax later on. 
GEMINI, The Moon now turns your attention back towards routine issues of survival. Over the next few weeks, you must ensure that any new offers or alterations in your earnings will be to your advantage. It's all about making certain that your dreams come true. CANCER Even those who were once so close or supportive may now be going their own ways. Don't panic: partners, colleagues and associates will be doing you a good turn if they loosen the bonds even a little. Perhaps you should have the confidence to stand on your own feet. 
LEO, Shaken, but not stirred - that's what your planets are at the moment! Even unwelcome or unexpected changes will be to your advantage in the long run, such is the beneficial power to be felt from the Sun influencing the region of your chart dealing with long-term hopes and wishes.

VIRGO, Current planetary activity is forcing you to look outside the narrow limits of your current existence. If you wish to resuscitate long-buried ambitions, especially in the personal sphere, now is your chance. This time you can do it without worrying about other people's opposition. 
LIBRA, Five planets in angles of your chart ruling home and work are bound to raise major issues. The question is whether the emotional satisfaction you receive from public affairs will be sufficient to take your mind off certain family or domestic frustrations. 
SCORPIO, You have made the right moves, and now it is up to others to make the required concessions. However, if you start being unreasonable and demanding contrition from partners, events may eventually blow up in your face. Give them all the space they need to come to terms with their own behaviour. Also read | Kashmir mediation: Trump backs off, S Jaishankar draws the line 
SAGITTARIUS, Partners now need to have their say. You must be prepared to wait a little longer before you see your plans and ideas put into practice. And do remember that, for the next four weeks, certain additional restrictions will be placed on your freedom of action. 
CAPRICORN, You're not entirely in control of circumstances at the moment. One plan or proposition cannot be developed much further until others prove they are ready to play their full part. I can see that any help and assistance you require will be forthcoming just as soon as you say the word. AQUARIUS Being so emotional, the Moon can be an irritating influence from the Aquarian point of view. You may be reminded of a number of responsibilities that you would rather forget or push to one side. But, then, it's always uncomfortable to face the truth. 
GEMINI, A difficult emotional situation is hopefully fading from your life, assuming you're making the most of the opportunity the Moon is offering to put the past behind you. An act of conscious will may be necessary; the more determined you are, the more likely you are to succeed. CANCER It isn't selfish to want more time for yourself, so don't be reluctant to preserve your own space. Others must learn that they can't take you for granted forever. Unattached romantic Cancers could be attracted to colleagues at work; business and pleasure become intertwined. 
LEO, Sometimes partners think you're a little naive but, in reality, you are far too astute to let them drive you into second place. The Sun is now a sure sign that you'll get the better of almost everyone who crosses your path over the next two weeks or so. Have faith in yourself!

VIRGO, Your lunar patterns cajole, encourage and support you. Your major quality of the moment should be enthusiasm. You see, if you are confident you will attract positive developments, but if you expect the worst you will miss out on a golden opportunity. 
LIBRA, Please remember that although the general progress of events is quite smooth, your judgment is likely to be impaired for no other reason than that yesterday saw irrational planetary alignments. The unmistakable conclusion is that you must be content with your lot. 
SCORPIO, Although the planets generally are in a rather vibrant position, Mars, your planetary ruler, is labouring through your solar chart. On one hand, this suits you, for other people are more inclined to appreciate your emotional approach, but it does rather tend to emphasise any lack of practical sense. 
SAGITTARIUS, Maintain your self-respect at all costs. The Moon, you see, is sending you various tests and challenges, the immediate result of which may be to undermine your confidence. First, you must understand that this is the case and then you should find ways to restore your position. Explained | Consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav: What ICJ ordered; Pakistan has ‘offered' to India 
CAPRICORN, You'll soon be making a renewed bid for freedom, yet right now you would do better to consolidate your existing position, making sure your life is built on firm foundations. All of you should remember that, in the astrological universe, change is perpetual and nothing is permanent. AQUARIUS You would no doubt gain untold benefit personally, professionally and financially, from new alliances and associations. However, before you proceed, just ask yourself whether current goals are really and truly exactly what you want. 
GEMINI, Today's lunar position indicates a time when you may hide yourself away and rest, recharging your batteries in readiness for the coming battles and victories. To do this, though, you may need to duck some of your responsibilities! CANCER If tensions erupt, they may be difficult to control, mainly because the issues will be obscured behind a fog of confusion and misunderstanding. Tread warily, though, and you'll easily dodge such pitfalls. And, remember, by anticipating the future you can change it to your advantage.

LEO, Challenging lunar aspects advise you not to count on certain transactions being finalised on time. A brief hiatus may actually do you good, allowing you to get on and complete the preliminaries or tie up loose ends. A delay is as good as a rest. 
VIRGO, Listen to reason and accept that partners also wish to resolve joint problems. Soon you may expect to receive thanks for past efforts, or plaudits for your more successful endeavours. Such appreciation is no more than you deserve. It will certainly provide a pleasant boost to your confidence. 
LIBRA, The Moon now inaugurates a new three-month period of success and fulfilment, at least for all Librans who are capable of looking on the bright side. Specific areas which will benefit include everything to do with travel, education or the law. It's all a question of tuning in to the larger picture. 
SCORPIO, Your sign has stronger associations with money than many of the others, and I believe that, after today, you will begin to feel your business sensibilities stirring. Emotionally your passions will be more alert - you'll be looking for a challenge in a relationship. Also Read | BCCI gets a dose from Govt: You don't have authority to test players for drugs 
SAGITTARIUS, Those of you with major schemes on the go, whether personal or professional should reach a satisfactory turning-point. In love, you'll prefer the company of old and tested companions to new excitement. You have much to learn from people who have already had the experiences which are now coming your way. 
CAPRICORN, It looks as if your work or similar responsibilities are about to increase drastically. On the whole, this will be a welcome development even though you may be taken aback by the rate of change. Yet, there does seem to be a great deal happening at the moment which is taking you on to a more positive personal course. AQUARIUS Over the next couple of days, the powerful and emotional Moon will come to your aid, enabling you to break any deadlocks and shift any obstacles, even those which seemed insurmountable until not so long ago. It's strange how quickly circumstances change when you're looking the other way. 
GEMINI, Your current secretive phase is due to continue for some weeks yet, although changes this week will see you more ready to disclose confidential information. Emotionally, you can look towards stable relationships and faithful friends as your best bet. CANCER Your sociable stars remain strong. The ideal way to exploit your current celestial influences is to involve yourself in group and community enterprises, perhaps to do with the environment or another worthy cause. What you really want to do is make the world a better place - or at least your small corner of it. 
LEO, For some reason, your private entanglements and public activities seem to be dovetailing. You must prove that you are capable of handling responsibilities and duties across the board. It's not enough just to deal with details which concern you and nobody else. Read | Unnao: In heavy rain, truck was speeding on wrong side, driver fled, say witnesses 
VIRGO, Now that the Sun has altered its position you must push yourself forward. This particular planetary picture brings out your maternal qualities - even if you're a full-blooded male! By this, I mean that you'll be taking sensitive and defenceless folk under your wing over the next few weeks. 
LIBRA, Libra is one of the three Air signs, which means that by nature you are generous and sometimes impractical. My advice at the moment is that it is fine to be a lazy, languid, lugubrious Libran and to resist all pressure to the contrary and that people who don't like that can lump it! 
SCORPIO, You may be irritated by the fact that partners are apparently making the running at home or in the family. Yet, why don't you stop and think? All you need to do is propose a radically different way of running your routine and all your arrangements will fall into place very favourably. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you desire to be more independent necessitates an upheaval on the home front, then so much the better. Happily, Venus is now safeguarding your emotional interests and making it quite acceptable to take personal risks - just as long as you are aware of the consequences. 
CAPRICORN, The problem in your horoscope lies not in the sections of your chart ruling money, but in that signifying speculation and risks. You're supposed to be a past master at handling finances, but right now you appear desperate for reassurance. Perhaps, though, you can reassure yourself. AQUARIUS Relationships with youthful relatives and children should be showing signs of improvement. One way or another, perhaps through work, younger people are bound to cross your path over the next two weeks, probably exerting a greater influence on your thinking. 
GEMINI, It's a time of movement and growth, yet ironically so much depends on your reaction to delays, frustrations and imposed restrictions. In other words, don't let imaginary obstacles blind you to marvellous opportunities. Check out a major problem and you'll see how fast it disappears. CANCER Today's dominant planetary aspect colours your life for the next week. My advice is to highlight co-operation but to insist that other people follow your ideas and plans rather than the reverse, which is so often the case. All it takes is a little of your gentle, persuasive charm. 
LEO, Professional influences in your horoscope are due to intensify briefly before dying down at the end of the week. Colleagues will be impressed by your caring, compassionate nature and a display of emotion may even go down well. Other people will be pleased to see that you really are concerned with their welfare. 
VIRGO, Today's Moon is, first of all, a deeply favourable presence in your chart, and should help stabilise your emotions and keep you in a contented mood. If you've not arranged a break, do so now. If you've made plans already, now is the time to fill in the details. 
LIBRA, In the past, you may have imagined that all your efforts and sacrifices were in vain. However, within a few days, you should see that you did the right thing, even if for the wrong reasons! At least there is some satisfaction in knowing how you can deal with the same problem next time around. 
SCORPIO, You really are the brightest of the bunch at the moment. No matter how you have been put down in the past by people who imagine they are smarter than you, you must now push and promote your own original ideas. If you don't make the first move, nobody else will. 
SAGITTARIUS, Mercury's celestial relationships are just what you like most: unusual, stimulating, adventurous and independent. A plan, scheme or project you imagined would be a sure-fire success will, therefore, benefit from a complete rethink. Everything is up for grabs. 
CAPRICORN, Many Capricorns are complaining about their lot. Let me make one thing clear: almost all your problems may be solved by a change of attitude. To an extent, your ideas are now out of date and behind the times. They'll be back in fashion eventually, but not yet! AQUARIUS I don't see any real chance of misunderstandings, mistakes or blunders. On the contrary, your horoscope is assuming a brighter prospect, enabling you to make the most of better family and personal relationships. There could even be professional benefits. 
GEMINI, The Moon is now playing a deeply sociable role. If you need friends, allies and supporters later in the week, now is the time to do the spadework, convincing other people and partners that you are the face of the future! Just one problem though - the facts may be anything but clear. CANCER Let's look at the long-term for a change: special planets together are urging you to make a renewed bid for freedom, re-establishing your personal independence in all the areas that count. Sheer enthusiasm takes you part of the way, but you&amp;'ll have to put in the extra hours as well. 
LEO, Professional schemes should now be underway. You still have a few weeks to discuss plans, cross the t&amp;'s and dot the i&amp;'s, but the foundations should now be laid. From this vantage point, you should broaden your horizons and contemplate a more fulfilling existence. 
VIRGO, Because this week's lunar patterns stimulate lively regions of your chart, your priority will be to be noticed. This is no time to hide behind a poor self-image or a mistaken notion that certain goals are beyond you. The future will be here sooner than you think! 
LIBRA, Stick to the rules and conventional methods and you won&amp;'t go far wrong. You see, whatever your feelings today, the week's planetary configurations run solidly in your favour, and there is little that can go wrong. The Moon, by the way, could help you clear up a mystery. 
SCORPIO, Certain things need to be said and a few home truths delivered, especially now that Mercury is edging towards its confrontational relationship with Pluto. Clear the air now and you&amp;'ll avert traumas in weeks to come. Not only that, but partners will thank you for it. 
SAGITTARIUS, Don't expect instant results or demand that partners fit in with your plans. Imminent lunar patterns are bound to adjust your ideas, so whatever is decided now will be changed by the end of the week. That&amp;'s why you&amp;'ll do best to keep your options open and your diary free. 
CAPRICORN, Maximise the feel-good factor. It is clear from this week&amp;'s stars that the potential is present for a radical boost in your physical well-being. Now is the time to take whatever appropriate action is called for. Rest and relaxation are required! AQUARIUS Powerful lunar movements overshadow your emotions this week. Therefore, don&amp;'t just sit around daydreaming about exotic places - do something about it. If family members are waiting to hear from you, don&amp;'t delay. Get out there and let them know you care. 
GEMINI, You certainly have a great deal on your mind. In fact, the liveliest part of the day may take place when you're asleep. If you have any strange, uncomfortable feelings, it could be because your dream life is particularly active at the moment. Also, you'll be much happier once a family mystery is resolved. CANCER Friendly stars are coming your way, and this is a useful moment to team up with other people in a new venture. It is also a perfect period for giving yourself over to social pleasure and putting aside the stresses and strains of the real world. Hopefully you'll find someone who shares your fantasy! 
LEO, A sensational alignment between the Sun and Mercury will endow you with sheer brilliance, so don't be slow to bring your ideas forward. However, partners will be ready with their awkward questions. The golden rule is therefore not to talk about things you don't know anything about! 
VIRGO, Legal matters seem to be looming and, if at all possible, you should attempt to find a quick solution. Also, if you still have travel plans to arrange, do so as soon as you can. And, if there's a mystery to solve, go back as far into the past as you can to find the answer. 
LIBRA, Curiously enough, if you wish to make the right financial decisions, the answer may lie in a dream, perhaps in a waking daydream. If an emotional tie is becoming too intense, try to keep your feet on the ground. Also, if a partner is unable to give you the support you require, you may need to rely on yourself. 
SCORPIO, It's a positive week, so partnership questions need to be pursued as a matter of urgency, especially if there has been any bad feeling lately. It is domestic and family ties which are most important, although you may be perplexed by a colleague's changing ideas. 
SAGITTARIUS, The most important part of your life is work, which means that even relationships actually need to be worked at! Domestic chores should also be tackled, and if you get ahead of yourself now, you'll have more spare time later. Extravagant stars are lingering in the background. 
CAPRICORN, Personal and professional planets are finely balanced, which is undoubtedly good news. Within your family, children and younger relations should be given first place. You should also try to be more youthful and young at heart. If artistic ventures are on the go, you should do well. AQUARIUS There have been one or two threats to your stability recently, but these seem to be more imaginary than real. The way to find your feet is to seek support from those who know you best - the people you grew up with. Make sure that you offer partners support when they need it. 
GEMINI, If you're following up career proposals, then you might usefully spend the next few days planning interviews, making applications and plotting your next great move. Directness and honesty about your thoughts and feelings will be appreciated by those closest to you. CANCER Venus, ruler of love and affection, makes a temporary withdrawal from stressful relationships, hopefully easing some of the tensions which are bedeviling personal and professional relationships. If you have offended anyone, then you might be wise to apologise now - not next week! 
LEO, One reason for hold-ups has been your doubt about a particular course of action but, over the coming days, the sheer speed of developments may take you by surprise. Secret information may cause a change of plan, but if you do change your mind, you'd better let other people know about it. 
VIRGO, You may have been shouldering more than your fair share of responsibility for acquaintances or colleagues. The current period presents you with a chance to redress the balance and set the record straight. If you do this now, you'll no doubt avoid unnecessary hassles some way down the line. 
LIBRA, Your lunar alignments encourage an unusual and independent point of view. You may also, as it happens, devote as much time as is necessary to sort out domestic problems. A few days engaged in consulting family and friends and implementing overdue improvements will save trouble later. 
SCORPIO, Powerful planetary patterns continue, as does the uncertainty about where current developments are leading. Changes over the coming few days may at first be so subtle that their meaning will not be clear until next week. Mind you, that's not too long to wait. 
SAGITTARIUS, The financial situation remains critical, and you may be tempted to sit on the fence, waiting for a resolution. However, if you are too passive, you must expect to risk making a loss. Perhaps the central issue is your willingness to spend money on relationships or subsidise a loved one. 
CAPRICORN, The simultaneous movements of the Sun and Uranus are about to have an effect on your emotional life that will be as dramatic as it is difficult to control. A breath of fresh air could revitalise an old partnership - and can only add to your quality of life. AQUARIUS The Moon is on your side, so it's only to be expected that family members and people you live with should be backing you to the hilt. Not for the first time your planets show the possibility of dramatic financial dealings and important agreements. Yet illusions you hold so fondly now may be rudely shattered before long. 
GEMINI, Current planetary patterns should be keeping you on the go, and it looks very much as if you'll have the chance to experiment with new ways of managing affairs at home. Time-saving devices and gadgets could revolutionise your life, while more experienced people should have the answers you need. First, though, you have to ask. CANCER Life is looking up - at last. You should make an early start if you want to make the most of today's exceptionally lively planetary picture. This is a perfect moment to get out of the rut you've been in and instill a renewed sense of adventure into your life. 
LEO, Energetic planets make for an interesting day all round. Don't be dismayed if you're out of step with a partner, as differences of opinion on important matters are almost inevitable under the current relationship between Venus and Saturn. 
VIRGO, You can't live without other people - you know that better than anyone! You must pay greater attention to partners and joint activities, and allow yourself to rely on friends to help you cope if you've bitten off more than you can chew. There'll be little time to relax. 
LIBRA, Whether you are truly prepared or not, you're entering one of the busiest times of the year. Don't be surprised if social engagements are altered at the last minute, or if friends turn out to be not what they seem. They might just be pulling the wool over your eyes. 
SCORPIO, You are happy for most arrangements to stay as they are, yet changes of plan will be more than welcome if you've recently allowed yourself to sink into a rather pressurised routine. A financial plan may require further scrutiny, and your judgement could be open to question. 
SAGITTARIUS, A number of domestic disagreements could add spice to a lively period, and this is an excellent time to start acting over promised home improvements, including speculation in the property market if that's where your interests lie. Keep other people up to date though - especially if you require assistance. 
CAPRICORN, General trends now, and over the coming days, continue to be mildly disruptive, although there's no reason why this shouldn't be an enjoyable and stimulating period. If considering career moves, think about the financial consequences. Be kind to younger people. You never know when you might need their help! AQUARIUS Your favourite friends and loved ones will soon come to appreciate your generosity of spirit, and any cash you care to splash out will be warmly received. Disagreements about money will take place in an atmosphere of goodwill and hope for the future. 
GEMINI, It's definitely time to get out and about and not worry too much about what other people are doing. You may hear news that affects plans to join in a creative and enjoyable activity, so don't hang around! The quicker you get going, the sooner you'll reap the rewards. CANCER Some of you are much more affected by current tensions than others, but all of you should stay alive to possibilities that you'd normally ignore or rule out of order. Some plans may need reconsidering, but others should take care of themselves. Your job is to take each case on its own merits. 
LEO, You seem to be more concerned with public life than with private affairs. Career developments you thought were finished with long ago may require just a little more attention over coming weeks. In any event, it will be pleasant to go over old ground and return to former habits. 
VIRGO, The current planetary pattern is excellent for plans for the future, although it may be a wrench when it comes to saying goodbye to people, places and opinions from the past. Above all, play it safe with money. After all, you don't want someone else to benefit at your expense. 
LIBRA, At every moment you are taking decisions which affect your future. Whether this is an enjoyable time or not will depend entirely on how confident you are in your ability to cope with sudden changes of plan, and how ready you are to be thrown back on your own resources. 
SCORPIO, Over the next few days, the seeds will be sown that will lead to dramatically- changed circumstances over the coming months. Overseas contacts and foreign connections seem to be important, but you're not yet sure why this is so. Hopefully all will become clear in a couple of weeks. 
SAGITTARIUS, First-rate business plans are causing some excitement, no matter how small the financial outlay. Yet it's absolutely vital that you retain control over even the most insignificant details, otherwise you'll come unstuck. That would be a shame, especially after all the effort you've put in. 
CAPRICORN, One major issue that is confusing matters in your relationships, concerns your need for independence and your reluctance to give in to people who are trying to tie you down. But there's no need for a confrontation. If you explain to partners what you need, then you might find they are surprisingly adaptable - even relieved! AQUARIUS You should let your ambitions loose. Everyone should have their chance to sit at the top table, and now is your turn to grab a little of the limelight, so please don't hold back or give in to a lack of confidence. If you are hit by the occasional doubt, then summon expert assistance. 
GEMINI, Out-of-the-ordinary experiences are around at the moment, probably involving a person of exceptional skills. You'll need moral support at work if colleagues come on strong about your lack of commitment in recent months. But, then, certain individuals owe you a favour. CANCER Fresh information could certainly affect your plans. Unexpected news, perhaps concerning a financial or personal matter, could arrive today. You'll be able to see the good in a situation that may be alarming a close friend. In love, you will soon have cause to be proud of a partner. 
LEO, From now on, you may be seeing less of people who have both stimulated and disturbed you in the past. Personal issues which have been subject to unlikely twists and turns should soon be straightened out. Mind you, you may be surprised by the consequences. 
VIRGO, You're in for what, could be, an amusing period, socially; and associates will no doubt have plenty of ideas for livening up an existence which has been rather too routine. You must be flexible - and should be prepared to fit in with the unexpected. 
LIBRA, Your best ideas are often triggered by chance discussions or encounters. Yet, when the unexpected does occur, it may be distressing. The secret is to remain flexible and open to suggestion. If you can possibly take your professional plans a significant step forward, then don't give in to doubts and unnecessary delays. 
SCORPIO, There is a great deal of uncertainty, at the moment, due to the unsteadiness and temporary nature of certain planetary movements. At all times you should be alert to emotional undercurrents. At the very least, you will soon be ready to tell a special person how you feel. 
SAGITTARIUS, You should push ahead with all hopeful enterprises but bear in mind that, with the continuing friction between Saturn and Neptune, the financial implications remain fluid to say the least. Friction at work is likely, but could turn out to have surprisingly positive consequences. 
CAPRICORN, It's difficult for you to be sure of just what is the best way forward, at the moment, as the planets assume a formation whose results depend almost entirely on your ability to stay one step ahead of events. The best thing to do now might be to watch and wait until clarity is restored. AQUARIUS Not everything is as it seems - as you have discovered. Imaginative get-rich-quick schemes always have hidden pitfalls but, as long as you take the trouble to discover and deal with these, there's no reason why you shouldn't proceed with hope in the future. 
GEMINI, Your confidence is justified but, whatever you do, don't throw caution to the wind. In particular, you should keep a very close watch on financial developments and dubious business deals. The day of reckoning will come sooner than you think, so, be prepared. CANCER You could be rushing ahead with little thought for the past. Old debts, including emotional ones, should now have been settled, and if you're determined to move forward, then before very much longer you will be free from a whole series of oppressive and inhibiting memories. 
LEO, The Moon's alignment with your second house of money inevitably brings finance to your attention, yet you're more likely to be concerned with saving or investing for the future than in spending wildly. What's more, you'll do whatever it takes to make a relationship work. 
VIRGO, Venus' vivacious alignments enhance your charming assets. Social gatherings are likely to work to your advantage, possibly because, if you take people into your confidence, you'll receive the practical help and advice which you so urgently need. 
LIBRA, You're busy, that's for sure, but you could be getting busier. In view of the fact that you've got such a lot on your plate, you should waste no time in bringing old tasks to completion, and initiating projects which have been on your mind for some time. 
SCORPIO, A series of strategic alignments between Venus, Mars and other planets are forcing you to come out of your shell and take the bull by the horns. Important discussions will go as planned, as long as you stick to your guns. Other people can only give you an honest response if you state what you want as clearly as possible. 
SAGITTARIUS, The pace of life continues to be fast, but not necessarily uncomfortably so. The planetary aspects are, absolutely, superb as far as all domestic changes and family relationships are concerned. But, then, you are owed some extra pleasure, as you know. 
CAPRICORN, There may be important lessons to be learnt in the coming days, especially about your tendency to let other people take over your life. You may combine assertiveness with tact and sensitivity in all your dealings with critics and rivals - and perhaps win them over to your side. AQUARIUS You can never be absolutely sure of what lies around the next corner. Testing conditions may take you away from steady partnerships and existing arrangements, but capitalise on your talents and take a creative approach to your ambitions and accounts. 
GEMINI, You should spare no effort when it comes to improving your existence. It's quite rare that such a beneficial line-up of planets affects your emotional state as at the present time, and you'd be foolish not to take advantage of this to improve the general condition of your partnerships. CANCER The immediate future looks positive and constructive, even if you do have a few doubts. Over the long-term, there's a definite need for more space and comfort in your living conditions, although you may not make a move until the Moon begins to play a role in your home and family affairs. 
LEO, You may concentrate on your material resources. It seems better to save than spend but if money must flow out, aim it towards necessities rather than luxuries. Above all, steer clear of those who are too fond of rumour and gossip - or who are out to waste your time. 
VIRGO, With the Moon so powerfully aligned with your sign, this is a fine day to make a greater than usual effort to get your own way and still reach sensible compromises. You'll be able to clear up niggling irritations with little difficulty, although you'd better have the facts at your fingertips. 
LIBRA, Sometimes you can hide your head in the sand - but not now. There's no getting away from your essential needs and desires today. The general planetary picture is extraordinarily helpful and there's little risk in forcing issues into the open as long as you keep a dialogue going with other concerned individuals. 
SCORPIO, In spite of a certain shyness, you love it when other people are forced to listen to your opinions, and that's exactly what you'll be insisting on this week. The fact is that your ideas are probably the best. But will other people agree? Well, probably not! 
SAGITTARIUS, There should be a welcome absence of tension from most of today's personal proceedings, although excitement could boil over into animated arguments and disputes. These are lively times and you're a force to be reckoned with, as reckless individuals could soon discover. 
CAPRICORN, The sky's the limit, and there's no reason why you shouldn't achieve your ambitions in whatever your main areas of activity happen to be. Friends will be of more help than you've come to expect, although any favours you accept now might have to be paid back sooner than you hope. AQUARIUS The planetary connections between your work and money are so powerful as to suggest an imminent windfall, almost certainly as a reward for all your past efforts. At least, that's one interpretation. Plus, for some reason we have yet to understand, discretion is required in personal matters. 
GEMINI, You certainly have a great deal on your mind. In fact, the liveliest part of the day may take place when you're asleep. If you have any strange, uncomfortable feelings, it could be because your dream life is particularly active at the moment. Also, you'll be much happier once a family mystery is resolved. CANCER Friendly stars are coming your way, and this is a useful moment to team up with other people in a new venture. It is also a perfect period for giving yourself over to social pleasure and putting aside the stresses and strains of the real world. Hopefully you'll find someone who shares your fantasy! 
LEO, A sensational alignment between the Sun and Mercury will endow you with sheer brilliance, so don't be slow to bring your ideas forward. However, partners will be ready with their awkward questions. The golden rule is therefore not to talk about things you don't know anything about! 
VIRGO, Legal matters seem to be looming and, if at all possible, you should attempt to find a quick solution. Also, if you still have travel plans to arrange, do so as soon as you can. And, if there's a mystery to solve, go back as far into the past as you can to find the answer. 
LIBRA, Curiously enough, if you wish to make the right financial decisions, the answer may lie in a dream, perhaps in a waking day-dream. If an emotional tie is becoming too intense, try to keep your feet on the ground. Also, if a partner is unable to give you the support you require, you may need to rely on yourself. 
SCORPIO, It's a positive week, so partnership questions need to be pursued as a matter of urgency, especially if there has been any bad feeling lately. It is domestic and family ties which are most important, although you may be perplexed by a colleague's changing ideas. 
SAGITTARIUS, The most important part of your life is work, which means that even relationships actually need to be worked at! Domestic chores should also be tackled, and if you get ahead of yourself now, you'll have more spare time later. Extravagant stars are lingering in the background. 
CAPRICORN, Personal and professional planets are finely balanced, which is undoubtedly good news. Within your family, children and younger relations should be given first place. You should also try to be more youthful and young at heart. If artistic ventures are on the go, you should do well. AQUARIUS There have been one or two threats to your stability recently, but these seem to be more imaginary than real. The way to find your feet is to seek support from those who know you best - the people you grew up with. Make sure that you offer partners support when they need it. 
GEMINI, The Moon will arrive in a favourable and passionate position in the nick of time. All confusion, uncertainty and lost causes should be cleared up then. You'll begin to feel much happier about the way family relationships and events at home are heading. CANCER Life is shrouded in mystery - and something seems to be perplexing you. If you have any say in the matter, do make inquiries of family members, for they may be in the know. Make time for a little quiet reflection and recharge your spiritual batteries. 
LEO, Socially your stars are suddenly looking extremely bright. I suspect strongly that you may meet someone rather special, but you may feel pulled in two directions. Leave difficult choices until later, for tomorrow if you wish, because there might still be secret information to emerge. 
VIRGO, Take your bearings and give yourself plenty of time if professional affairs intrude on your private life. It may be a family member who is contemplating a step forward and could do with a spot of advice. You might have to follow through with practical help, so make sure you've got the spare time. 
LIBRA, There are a couple of very powerful planetary aspects homing in on a prominent region of your chart. The obvious consequence should be a very pleasant, long journey, perhaps not straight away, but within the month. Think about where you'd like to go, and start planning. 
SCORPIO, There is simply no way that you can keep a secret any longer. Take a fresh look at what you're doing with your money. You can break with past habits, but don't shock people unnecessarily, especially if they've been good to you. And give a younger relation the benefit of the doubt - within reason. 
SAGITTARIUS, You cannot possibly expect other people to fall in with your plans without question. At last partners will begin to ask exactly how, why and when. If money is involved, then listen to their every word. Not everything they say makes sense, but some of it does - so pay attention! 
CAPRICORN, Any feelings of remorse or anger should be dealt with now. Not only will you discover your tongue, but you'll also realise what you really want to say. Don't rush it though, as the chances are that you'll be altering your personal opinions more than once over the next three weeks. AQUARIUS A family and routine-bound day should give way to a more enjoyable evening. Make a point of enjoying yourself. It could be very useful for your morale, and hence your whole state of being, to throw caution to the wind: that's the only way to discover where your limits lie. 
GEMINI, Even though it is difficult to express your thoughts, needs and desires with any clarity, I don't think this should hold you back. Say the first thing that comes into your mind, but listen carefully to partners' responses. And never believe that you are automatically right: you're not! CANCER Press ahead with social plans and give a high priority to personal contacts at work. It will all seem very worthwhile, but, in point of fact, by tomorrow you may be inclined to withdraw your favours. Perhaps you'll begin to see old information in a new light. 
LEO, Jealousy, resentment or fear on the part of someone close is always likely to burst out. Yet if you can possibly exert a little personal discipline, others will thank you for your sense of duty and honour. If you do the right and proper thing, then friends and family are bound to respect you much more, even if you don't have so much fun. 
VIRGO, In some small way a new dawn is coming. Some kind of reawakening is about to take place and, within a few days, you might be prepared to take more on trust. You may have a secret and you'll certainly be in the know to an extent which others may envy. 
LIBRA, Business-minded types should be on top form today. It is time to make a few skilful purchases and profitable investments. Those in the property market or spending money on the home will succeed particularly well. It's a question of buying what you need rather than what you want. 
SCORPIO, You have learned a great deal about self-preservation and I doubt if anyone will be able to undermine you. You can reach out and restore a friendship that has gone adrift, and put on a pleasant face for new acquaintances. You may also begin to feel passions stirring in surprising ways. 
SAGITTARIUS, Sometimes you just have to knuckle down and get on with the tasks in hand. The work ethic rears its head, and you may have to pay a great deal of attention to your duties and obligations. You have a much greater capacity to work in a methodical and routine manner than associates often believe. 
CAPRICORN, Far too much time has already been expended on unnecessary disputes or conflicts. Today, I'd advise you to look only on the bright side and to make the most of all contacts with friends and partners. I once heard someone say that our friends are our greatest treasure. How true! AQUARIUS These are still early days. I'd say that one phase of expansion and improvement is now complete and that you should begin to retrench. If you're making long-range plans, put down a marker for about four months' time, and set that as the target for achieving your personal goals. 
GEMINI, There was a time when you appeared to be on a collision course. Some of you, a minority, actually got to the point where confrontation was unavoidable. But the majority found that a threatened dispute has gradually disappeared or become utterly pointless. CANCER Reality is not always your first option, but just what is real, anyway? With a simple reversal of some of your basic attitudes you can turn the current situation on its head and find fresh solutions to tired old problems. This also, by the way, happens to be a moment to focus your mind on the practical details. Read | Karnataka trust vote today: Speaker's call on resignations, says SC, but gives rebel MLAs a shield 
LEO, You are about to have the chance to put your plans into effect, so there is no turning back or opting out. Feel free to insist that others give your ideas a chance. Consider your professional and worldly ambitions, and try to decide whether to set off on a new course, or leave it until next time around. 
VIRGO, It is tiresome when other people tell you what to do, especially when it's none of their business. Only you know best, and you must not allow partners, loved ones or friends to influence your judgment. Resurrect any forgotten overseas contacts, especially with former lovers and family members who reside in foreign parts. 
LIBRA, Individuals who exercise a degree of power must be won over with charm. Nothing else will do. People who feel pushed into a corner will react sharply, and will not appreciate your efforts to get your own way. And those who feel ignored might blame you for not paying them enough attention! 
SCORPIO, Financial plans should be formulated as fast as possible. In fact, I'd suggest that you go ahead and present partners with a fait accompli. Female friends and sensitive types offer the best advice, perhaps because the qualities required at the moment are highly intuitive.

SAGITTARIUS, Social events are moving your way, so you now have a splendid opportunity to mend fences. Enjoy yourself today, for soon you receive reminders of all those boring chores and duties. In matters of the heart, try to follow your own desires, rather than being pressurised by social or family expectations. 
CAPRICORN, Even though certain individuals have taken sides against you, there seems to be little to bother you. Mercury and Venus form a favourable team, encouraging you to go for discreet get-togethers rather than riotous gatherings. You'll be anxious to see that everyone has a fair crack of the whip. AQUARIUS The period immediately after the weekend will bring unexpected benefits, so if you're straining at the leash now, do be patient. Social stars look favourable and a recent tiff should now be ancient history. If someone else doesn't hold out the hand of friendship first, then you get on and make the necessary moves. 
GEMINI, You're probably now coming under the shadow of the next major lunar alignment, and day-to-day ups and downs will only make sense when you look back with hindsight. This is a moment for casual companionship rather than raw passion, so don't expect what's not on offer! CANCER Busy stars will certainly keep you on your toes, but a measure of uncertainty is clouding the issues. You may have to accept that one particular course of action is a dead end in the short run, but could have welcome spin-offs next year. But what these will be, nobody can say! 
LEO, You're in charge. This means that not only could you be the cause of a minor dispute, but also that you have the means to restore peace. Overseas and long-distance contacts should be cultivated, partly because it's people from backgrounds very different from yours who offer the greatest interest and stimulation.

VIRGO, You should continue to believe that you are in the right. Spending plans should proceed as normal, but if you can possibly veer towards the imaginative and romantic end of the spectrum, so much the better. It's just that a day-dream could open your eyes to practical solutions and a concrete advantage. 
LIBRA, All things must pass, as the song says. That's one of the laws of astrology. The final round in a long, drawn-out battle is on the way, but as we're talking in years rather than weeks, you must maintain your grasp on the future. Important discussions should soon be completed. 
SCORPIO, You must now learn to be more discriminating in your choice of friends. At work, you may distinguish between people who are genuinely helpful and those who can put over a flashy presentation but totally lack the sort of meaning and substance which you bring. 
SAGITTARIUS, The fact is that you have the best ideas, and you are in control. You need not fear people who harbour angry resentments or have sharp tongues and bitter words. You can also avoid contributing to tense situations - and count to ten before delivering any more home truths. 
CAPRICORN, It's your right not to be tied down, but colleagues and close associates are tearing their hair out at the moment. In about four or five days you'll be ready to explain yourself and offer a few answers. But by the time that partners have caught up with where you are now, you'll have moved on. Read | Bail rider for woman held for offensive post: Donate Quran copies AQUARIUS You may finalise a number of social arrangements, or put a new friendship on firm ground, before the next phase in your personal affairs commences. The answer to any difficulties with children or younger relations may lie in the past. It's all a matter of knowing where to draw the line. 
GEMINI, You may have cut off your nose to spite your face - or turned the clock back in one important area. But, then, that may not be a bad thing! Who knows? You might actually have avoided a whole heap of trouble by bailing out of a commitment. A friend may need reassurance, though. Read | Lunar Eclipse to take place today: Here's how you can watch it CANCER You are showing a strong tendency to over-work. You may also be feeling under the weather, perhaps as a result of past strain. On the other hand, your general stellar and celestial influences today are positive and you could therefore do much to remedy the situation. 
LEO, Your current planetary patterns seem to be making you more energetic and self-confident. If you have any role models, they should be found amongst children and younger people or, at the very least, those friends who make a point out of being light-hearted. 
VIRGO, Of all the signs of the zodiac, yours may find itself most sharply squeezed between contradictory pressures and irreconcilable options. In addition, your range of possible actions could be limited: there may be nothing to choose between total commitment and a complete break.

LIBRA, It's clear that you can't carry on for ever in the same old groove, and you must be prepared to cut out a great deal of dead wood if you are to get your point across. Others must be able to see that you are not hung up by beliefs which are nothing if not irrelevant. 
SCORPIO, There are a number of adverse planetary patterns, but it would be a mistake to imagine that life must be difficult. When challenging events accumulate, it is always possible to search for, and find, the grain of gold which can transform your future. Make your own success! 
SAGITTARIUS, Everything depends on what you expect. If you continue to believe that other people will let you down then they probably will. However, one way to deal with personal squabbles might be to recognise others' independence, just as you insist that they respect yours. 
CAPRICORN, Any current restlessness is likely to be born out of frustration. The way to live positively at the present is to be thoroughly self-sacrificing and utterly charitable in all your dealings with your fellow humans. Mind you, if you are going to abandon your own interests, make sure you do it for a deserving cause. AQUARIUS There are still far too many uncertainties and loose ends, but that is often the way you like it, so don't complain. Memory is a funny thing and, if you look back to a time when life was more secure, you are almost certainly deluding yourself. You have as much in your favour now as you did then. 
GEMINI, Partners may still be in disagreement, but not for much longer. You could find it difficult to accomplish your tasks and feel as if one particular goal is slipping from your grasp. But be assured that friends and allies will continue to carry the torch on your behalf, probably right through to next year. Read today's horoscope in Malayalam | Bangla | Tamil CANCER Now is a good time to reconsider your attitude to close partners. Also, develop all foreign contacts and get in touch with friends and relatives abroad. Adventure is in the air, even in a small way, and you may be tempted to take major risks - in moderation, of course! 
LEO, Relatively sympathetic stars favour financial adventures. You are inclined to spend your hard-won money on luxuries and may be tempted to take a gamble. As to this last point, you must take responsibility for your own actions: if plans do come unstuck then it's up to you to get them back on track. 
VIRGO, Nobody really knows what you are thinking at the moment, or even what you are experiencing. Either your thoughts have sped ahead of your actions, or plans are lagging behind what is actually happening. One way or the other, you've got to catch up with yourself. 
LIBRA, There's a wide range of possibilities today, which means that all astrologers should be disagreeing with each other. I'll take a middle road and advise you to spread yourself around as widely as possible, investigating any personal options you may have ignored until now. 
SCORPIO, You appear to be having second thoughts, which may come as a surprise to some people who thought they knew you well. It may be that you no longer feel so secure in a choice that you took a few weeks ago, but that uncertainty may reflect nothing more then the fact that you must now stand on your own two feet. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your expansive and optimistic nature should now be an advantage. There is nothing to hold you back save your own memories, and perhaps fears. You can let rip and live like there's no tomorrow. To put it another way, if you focus your attention on the present, then you will begin to build a better future. 
CAPRICORN, It's bound to be a few days before you gain a fix on exactly what is going on. You may do best to keep your private thoughts to yourself. You never know when blurting something out is going to have consequences opposite to those you desire: every word you utter could come to mean something much more than you intended. AQUARIUS You must now make some decisive moves and salvage as much as you can before your mood changes. Very soon you will realise that life is a good deal more mysterious and uncertain than you once thought. Someone close to you already realises that there can be no final answer. 
GEMINI, Professionally, the sky is the limit just as long as you realise that what matters now is personal relationships with colleagues. Always do your best to get on with people, make them feel good, and see to it that they like you. At home you should get practical repairs done - and quickly. CANCER You may now have no alternative but to come to terms with enforced changes in relationships. Indeed, the more you accept that current conditions are there to stay, the sooner you can get on and make the most of marvellous emotional possibilities. A professional plan could be postponed, but not for too long. 
LEO, Professional matters are profoundly important and, even if you're not at work, you should give top priority to satisfying your own interests and fulfilling your worldly ambitions. In your private life, get in touch with old friends or ex-lovers. A trip to the past could prove entertaining. ;t=31s 
VIRGO, All the indications are that passionate and intimate relationships are now subject to curious and uncertain influences. Your instincts and hunches should be urging you to delay important decisions for a little while longer. Wait until you know exactly what is happening. When you have all the information at your fingertips, make your move. 
LIBRA, You should be quite sure that you are offloading only what has become stale and worn out. The danger is that you will throw away the good with the bad, the deeply useful with the utterly useless! It therefore goes without saying that you should think long and hard before speaking on vital matters. 
SCORPIO, At work, you have now entered a short but crucial and demanding phase when so much you take for granted is up for grabs. It's important that you are able to distinguish your own changes of attitude from your responses to events beyond your control. 
SAGITTARIUS, Powerful planets are now definitely on your side, so you can afford to hope for the best. At long last you are able to assert your primacy in all emotional relationships, whether at home, in love or work. Project yourself in the right way and people will look to you as a figure always to be relied upon. 
CAPRICORN, You will almost certainly resent anyone who tries to peer into your secret world or private life. You can probably get away with giving other people the impression that they are being kept up to date, while actually telling them nothing! AQUARIUS You appear to have cut quite a dash over the past few weeks but, with Mars about to adjust its position, you must realise that you can no longer go on as before. It's important to consolidate all personal gains rather than taking on fresh activities, otherwise you may over-commit yourself. 
GEMINI, From a close examination of the stars, it appears that you've little to fear from threatened confrontations or crises and everything to look forward to in terms of rest, relaxation and a chance to re-charge your batteries. In spite of everything, I am sure you will return fitter than ever. CANCER Sympathetic signs from the Moon for most of the day encourage you to treat friends more sensitively, although you may be too wrapped up in your own hopes and fears to take other people seriously. They also, by the way, encourage you to spend more money! 
LEO, Mars, the most energetic of all the planets, continues to give a cutting edge to events around you which is stimulating but may be rather dangerous emotionally. With luck you should manage to get your own way, especially if you're dealing with family matters. 
VIRGO, After all you've been through, you're now looking forward to the time when life will at last be more restful. Part of the difficulty lies in your failure to organise your affairs properly. And that's a problem which dates back well into last year, to when conditions were different. 
LIBRA, At last you're standing up for yourself, and an issue which has caused a certain amount of angst in family circles should be close to a solution. Do what you can to help the healing process on its way, and you'll earn the love and respect of your peers in the process. 
SCORPIO, You can be justly pleased with your progress, but don't expect other people to praise you unduly. There are those who disagree profoundly with what you have done as well as your way of doing it. You have probably learnt by now that gentle persuasion works much better than banging heads together. 
SAGITTARIUS, Whether the future continues along positive lines is largely up to you. No two of you will have used your skills, opportunities and experience in exactly the same way. It won't be long before the tide really starts to turn in your direction, although I suspect that you're growing tired of waiting. 
CAPRICORN, Venus is the traditional ruler of emotional relationships, and its position in your chart in recent weeks has indicated a tendency to be too secretive in this department. There may be something a partner should know. But should you tell them? You can, but you'll have to sugar the pill. AQUARIUS Important decisions lie ahead as far as your professional status is concerned, but there may be other ambitions about which choices will have to be made fairly soon. A partner may be moving too fast for your liking. On the other hand, you're not exactly sitting on your hands. 
GEMINI, You may still be adjusting to the fact that, after a number of years, you are no longer the centre of attention. In many ways this change reflects a shift in your self-image rather than any real alteration in your circumstances. That will make it much easier to cope with. CANCER Your famous Cancerian reserve stems not so much from a lack of feeling as from a failure to express those very considerable emotions that inhabit your unconscious. Try to be more direct in future. Because, if you're not, other people will be! That's for sure. 
LEO, Venus, Mercury and Neptune, those three sensational planets, are still occupying significant positions. With any luck, the pressure and uncertainty which they have brought into your life should now be in their final stages. And hopefully you should soon feel fitter. 
VIRGO, The Sun is decisively altering its relationship to Mercury, your ruling planet, but in many respects the heat may still be on. In particular, take into account just how desperate an acquaintance or business partner is to hear from you: sit down and listen! 
LIBRA, The week may be drawing to a close but there are indications of a last-minute panic at work, prompted by events for which you may or may not be responsible. In any event, you'll be required to deal with the consequences in your usual inimitable, charming style. 
SCORPIO, Often, it's surprisingly difficult to cope with good fortune, if only because of the inevitable adjustments to a new routine which must follow. Don't let such considerations blind you to your current opportunities, or to an offer made by a close relation. 
SAGITTARIUS, It cannot be stressed too highly that Mercury, situated as it is in a realistic sector of your solar chart, is providing you with protection and guarantees that you'd be a fool to ignore. All areas of your life may benefit. And I honestly believe that they will. 
CAPRICORN, Your current planetary patterns are bound to exacerbate certain irritations, yet it's at such times that you are driven to implement improvements in your circumstances and relationships that would otherwise inevitably be delayed indefinitely. AQUARIUS After many ups and downs, you may now look forward to a period in which you'll be able to appreciate past achievements in an atmosphere of calm rather than one of strife and antagonism. On the other hand, if you accept that anything new is probably better than the life you're leaving behind, you'll get on so much better. 
GEMINI, Try and see the advantages of a proposed arrangement, all the more so if you are inclined to dismiss the person or people involved as weak or incompetent. In fact, it's time to listen to wise counsel. And, when you have done that, you will be much better prepared to get your way. CANCER The good news regarding your work is that Mars, which has been responsible for various underlying conflicts, is no longer as important as it once was. Lose no time in discussing problems with your colleagues. And don't do anything precipitate in the financial field. 
LEO, Why ignore the fact that you have skills and talents as creative as anyone you know? This is no time to allow daily trivia to take up so much effort that you fail to develop your fascinating qualities. If work and hum-drum chores build up, I am afraid you'll just have to put up with it. 
VIRGO, Don't complain too strenuously about the lack of support you've received from people who are supposed to be on your side. They can't very well help you if you haven't told them what you're doing! If your work commitments accumulate, you're liable to do something rash, but keep an eye on the consequences. 
LIBRA, The situation at the moment seems to be improving steadily, although you are justified in being over-cautious and concerned, fearful that certain difficulties might return to haunt you. On the other hand, I can't see anyone getting the better of you. 
SCORPIO, Other people may be hoping that they'll be the beneficiaries of whatever success or good luck you have created for yourself. Yet there really is no reason why you should allow yourself to be blackmailed. It's just that when you're not sure what partners are up to, you imagine the worst. Relax! 
SAGITTARIUS, Give careful consideration to a proposition or offer put to you now, because the moment you decide to get involved in a new scheme, a series of obstacles will be removed, opening the way to other possibilities. And that just has to be very good news, hasn't it? 
CAPRICORN, Adverse or challenging planetary aspects have been associated with recent feelings of insecurity, yet now that astrological alignments are changing so fast, it's important to let go of past fears and worries. And, as it happens, you do have most of the best ideas at the moment. AQUARIUS This is a testing time of the year for you although, in a sense, opportunities for change and improvement have never been as powerful as now. You must have faith in your ability to bring off a successful professional coup. You should also be convinced that you can win someone's heart. 
GEMINI, Professional events have definitely taken an upturn, and even domestic chores should be much less bother than in recent months. Capitalise on helpful planetary influences and make the most of your advantages, chiefly being an upsurge in your creative powers. CANCER Throughout the ups and downs of recent weeks, one thing has remained constant, and this is that behind current developments lies a drift towards a life that can be more fulfilling, and which will give you greater scope to express your real talents. 
LEO, The fact that Mercury is today sending a series of important signals will bring relief from recent disagreements and dilemmas. Over the next two weeks, go all out to put agreements on to a firm footing, but first you may have to revise certain details. 
VIRGO, Very soon your thoughts will be turning to those parts of your life which are fundamental to your existence. You know that there are improvements waiting to be implemented, and that only you can take the right initiatives. And don't spend too much while you're about it! 
LIBRA, You're entering a period which will be more intellectually inquisitive. In other words you'll be reading more, writing letters, sharing ideas and even contemplating signing up for a course. In love, you'll be pursuing personal goals close to home. 
SCORPIO, Now that certain worldly difficulties have been safely dealt with, you should be able to see that the most trying circumstances in the short term, are often those from which you gain the most in the long term. Oh, and by the way, you'll be doing well in conferences, meetings and interviews provided you stick close to the facts. 
SAGITTARIUS, In general, events should start to move in your direction, although you must be both flexible and decisive. In other words, you must stick to your guns but always take other people's wishes into account, never an easy task, I know. Do yourself a favour and put more energy into social arrangements. 
CAPRICORN, You're very sensitive to the needs of others, too sensitive some would say, and over the next month or so you'll be more influenced than is good for you by partners' grumbles and complaints. But then I have a feeling you'll turn every situation to the good. AQUARIUS There's no doubt that you're entering a period that will be more satisfying from the social point of view. You'll be putting your ideas across much more effectively than in the past - and you'll be getting on top of a decidedly knotty, legal question. 
GEMINI, So much of what has been going on has been hidden from view, so it's hardly surprising that you're not fully in command of the situation. But be prepared for a friend to blurt out the truth. And, when they do, be sure to have your story ready! And keep smiling. CANCER Quiet contemplation and solitude are advisable if at all possible, all the more so because you need time to put recent events into perspective. Try not to take on too many new commitments, otherwise you'll soon find that something has to give. 
LEO, If possible, put professional crises on hold and take advantage of opportunities to improve your domestic situation and family relationships. Excellent prospects will come your way if a move of home or domestic improvements are planned. Try not to be overwhelmed by too much information, though. 
VIRGO, You were born under a sensitive sign, and you'll be mightily relieved to hear that the planets are about to cease hassling you and your friends. Expect your responsibilities at work to multiply daily, and avoid over-committing yourself until you're clear about all the options. 
LIBRA, The Moon's helpful influence will assist you in your efforts to get a relationship back on the rails. You must take the initiative. If you're still feeling stressed at the weekend, it could be because you are not allowing yourself to let up. Relax whenever you can! 
SCORPIO, There's still a great deal on your plate and recent family changes are settling down. Don't be too unkind if a partner seems to have completely missed the point. After all, it's not long ago that you were also guilty of a misunderstanding. 
SAGITTARIUS, There's definitely something bothering you at the moment, you're just not sure what it is. There's an air of mystery, and skeletons which have been in the cupboard for too long are threatening to come out. And, when they do, you will have to improvise - and fast! 
CAPRICORN, Routine chores are piling up and need to be tackled without delay. This is a process you must be aware of if you are to make the most of your many talents and avoid being distracted by trivia. Professional challenges are looming, but you'll soon be able to break free with one bound. AQUARIUS Listen to people who are in a position to help you, especially to advise you on certain decisions which will have to be taken quite soon. In fact, it's clear that a family member has been partly responsible for your present, peculiar predicament. Maybe they can show you the way out! 
GEMINI, You may feel as if you're caught between two opposing options, uncertain which is the best way to free yourself from an impasse. The answer lies in your own hands and it's absolutely necessary that you truly understand your deeper motivations. Once you know what you want, you can get it!  CANCER Your friends and partners may now be under much more pressure than you, which makes for a change. Why not use this opportunity to help those in need and repay past favours? The general tone of the times, by the way, is lively and original, so no settling for the old and familiar. Try new options. 
LEO, The point to grasp is that contrasts and contradictions between your personal and professional lives will always be with you, and that you can only do yourself good by dealing with awkward choices and facing hard facts. Partners should respond best if you are totally honest. 
VIRGO, You are well-known for your sympathetic and compassionate qualities, and friends will be trooping to your door with problems for you to solve. Be your normal patient self. There do seem to be changes coming at work, so keep an eye out for interesting openings. 
LIBRA, All the signs point to the likelihood that you've just had, or are about to receive, a serious financial opportunity. In the final analysis, you know that only you are responsible for any losses or gains. The simple advice is to steer clear of strangers bearing false promises. 
SCORPIO, Recent events should have been good for your morale. Emotionally, you might be wondering just what has hit you, and why you have been singled out for such intriguing treatment. If there's too much to handle, then stay calm, don't panic and hang on to your secrets. 
SAGITTARIUS, It's difficult to think of a more fascinating astrological pattern than that which will be affecting many people around you. It could be a little while longer before the old certainty returns. It could even be a few weeks, so keep your plans good and flexible. 
CAPRICORN, Friends have been sending out mixed messages, and while you're willing to trust that events will work out as planned, a degree of doubt is creeping in. After today, planetary pressures will continue to be tense, but that could be helpful if it stirs you out of a rut. AQUARIUS It would be an understatement to suggest that current stars are confused. But, then, sometimes it's good to have your options all mixed up. And even if you score the slightest success against overwhelming odds, you will deserve sincere congratulations. If you relish change, so much the better. 
GEMINI, Short distance travel is more likely than long although, as soon as you leave home, you are liable to face delays. On the other hand, you never know when a hold-up might actually be for the best, perhaps saving you from a worse fate! At work, you may replace one job with another. CANCER Ambitious stars are in the ascendant. Press ahead at work, and even in leisure activities, you should aim to come first. You're in a competitive mood, and you may as well recognise it, for false modesty will only lead to frustration in the long run. 
LEO, The more adventurous zones of your chart are being triggered by brilliant planetary movements, which means that if you don't set off on some new venture now, you may have to wait another month or so. Always remember that the past holds the key to future success. 
VIRGO, There is much to be said for taking a break from your normal commitments. You do have a tendency to live the life of a hermit, and right now a brief period of solitude could be the most invigorating way to spend your time. Oh, and think ahead and arrange entertainments and gatherings for next month. 
LIBRA, It's time to pay a little more attention to all those routine matters, like how much things cost. You can be businesslike when you want, and this is precisely the time to take the lead and sort other people out as well! Younger relations will rely on you for your firm support, and will repay any favours over the coming years. 
SCORPIO, All your stars are crying out for collaboration and you will have to team up with partners: there is no choice. If you don't keep up, or if you imagine that you can go it alone, you will soon find otherwise. In love you are searching for status. 
SAGITTARIUS, Travel plans could be subject to some delay, so take the necessary action, like making sure you give yourself enough time. A family matter may involve a legal dimension so, here as well, you should be thoroughly prepared: leave nothing to chance. 
CAPRICORN, Your stars are making a rather lively turn. Take a more adventurous line, and also consider the ethical and moral consequences of your actions: if you have any doubts, hold on until you've been reassured. Travel plans should be put on to the top footing. AQUARIUS You may take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that, if you are let down in the future, no problems ensue. You should make a point of encouraging other people to see that their choices are theirs alone, and that you are not holding them back. 
GEMINI, Someone seems to have cut you to the quick, but you can be pretty sharp yourself. Many of you will be in a mood to join battle as soon as you are provoked. The flash point may not come today, or even tomorrow, but you must remain on your guard. CANCER Isn't it about time you thought more clearly about what you want to do before you do it? Normally your intuition works just fine, but now that everyone else is being so opinionated, you might as well say your piece and insist that the facts are finally heard. 
LEO, Enforced or unexpected changes on the home front should now be complete. Even if you're still clearing up a mess caused by other people, the chances are that you won't have to cope with any other major developments for a little while - at least not until next week! ;t=2s 
VIRGO, Venus, planet of love, has begun to exert an entirely new influence over your sign, bringing its soothing influence to your emotional life. Don't expect immediate results, but do anticipate an improvement in your mood within seven days - or even sooner. 
LIBRA, Certain individuals have been trying to kick up a fuss, but the question you must answer is whether your long-term interests are served by joining in the general melee or maintaining a dignified silence. If you're confident in your own gifts, and future, you can afford to keep quiet. 
SCORPIO, The situation at home still looks changeable, helped by the fact that you seem to be under less pressure. Just ensure that you do not say more than circumstances warrant. Keep on the right side of those whose support and approval is vital, if only for your own peace of mind. 
SAGITTARIUS, Romantic prospects are reasonably favourable, but the time for fun and spontaneity seems to have temporarily receded. Security appears to be the overriding issue. You'll judge others against some sensible and very individual standards of maturity and commonsense. 
CAPRICORN, To a certain extent your actions are governed by what other people expect. However, you have a choice. You need to think about what, exactly, is in your best interests. Should you listen to your own instincts or follow expert advice, even if it goes against the grain? There's no need to hurry it! AQUARIUS Planetary activity in and around delicate regions of your chart encourages you to express a completely different side of your character. You'll begin to see that other people will be more impressed by your ability to get your life together rather than by your Aquarian tendency to strike poses. 
GEMINI, It could be another four or five days before you have the power to enforce your will without the risk that you'll shoot yourself in the foot or undermine your own interests. This is a day to form alliances and act in concert with your sympathisers. CANCER Employers or those in positions of authority should be gearing up for some sort of initiative, but they may not make it before you take your decisions. And if you're sensible and keep quiet when others are sounding off, then you may be let off the hook and saved from embarrassment. 
LEO, Try to see people and situations as they really are. If you genuinely manage to understand the true nature of what's going on, you will realise that delays and unpunctuality are part of life's rich tapestry. Actually, an unscheduled hold-up might give you the chance to think again. 
VIRGO, Although you are very realistic in some senses, you do tend to bury your head in the sand when emotions are raised. You must realise that loved ones are entitled to receive direct answers to clear questions. If you're honest with them then they're more likely to be straight with you. 
LIBRA, As far as very intimate affairs are concerned, you must refuse to be drawn back into the past, no matter how persistent and tiresome other people become. Never allow yourself to be emotionally blackmailed, and if you have done something embarrassing, then come out and admit it! 
SCORPIO, Your personal life seems to have been turned upside down not once, not twice but possibly three times over the last twelve months. Everything seems to depend on how well you manage one or two important relationships, and how successful you are in keeping partners on your side. 
SAGITTARIUS, Questions of a joint financial nature may have made you feel inefficient or inept - or just not good at handling money! However, what transpires before long may have made you rather more certain than you were that you can handle almost any eventuality. 
CAPRICORN, Far too much has been going on behind the scenes for you to be bothered by new developments. One issue is that the questions no longer seem as clear-cut as they once were, and that standards appear to have slipped. Stick to high principles and you can't go too far wrong! AQUARIUS All those significant planetary patterns indicate far-reaching changes in partnership affairs. If at all possible, you must get a grip on people who won't, or can't, understand what requires to be done. Perhaps they need a good talking to! But are you the person to do it? 
GEMINI, It's always good to remember that, although you may be especially enthusiastic about a particular project, other people may see the world through totally different eyes. So don't try to bulldoze reluctant partners, but wait for them to catch up with you. CANCER No matter whether current questions, issues or problems be of a domestic or professional nature, you can be assured that if you follow a traditional Cancerian approach - delicate, sensitive and kind - you will serve your own best interests. Remember the old saying - as you sow, so shall you reap. 
LEO, Personally and financially, everything points to this being a phase for individual contemplation. If anything is troubling you, the root cause might be lingering worries over your security. That's why you should look for reassurance - and support - wherever you can find it. 
VIRGO, Yesterday's Solar alignments should already have clarified certain issues. At the centre of current affairs lies the whole manner in which you relate to other people. You may feel that you haven't been sufficiently assertive in the past, but that can be put right, now. 
LIBRA, Someone seems to have the bit between his, or her, teeth, possibly over a legal question or an overseas connection, or even over a matter of principle. Only if you persist in a particular and special course of action will you achieve your personal goals. 
SCORPIO, Some kind of battle or wrangle over finances may seem to be inevitable but is in fact quite avoidable. It's down to you to set an example by being clear and playing fair. There is no time for hesitation, and no reason to delay all your important preparations. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have every reason to nurture certain suspicions, perhaps that you have been duped, undermined or betrayed. However, there may be no need to consider retaliation, as the time for action may have passed. The reason is that other people may have been acting in good faith. 
CAPRICORN, It will be a rare and completely blinkered Capricorn who cannot now sense that emotional conditions are about to improve. The most intuitive amongst you will already realise that a happy encounter is just around the corner. All you have to do is recognise it when it comes! AQUARIUS In many ways you are absolutely spot on and completely right, but sometimes even you have to admit to having been wrong. On the other hand, there is more than a grain of truth in your opinions and beliefs, so get the balance right if you can. And do it now! 
GEMINI, You appear to be even more perceptive at the moment, partly because of intense alignments emanating from emotional regions of your chart. Just see to it that any professional contacts are not knocked off balance by impetuous or impulsive people - or by your own impatience. CANCER So much depends on your ability to handle facts. You see, if you resort to the normal emotional stereotype, you can set out to charm the opposite sex, but you won't win respect. If you challenge other people's image of you and surprise them, you may acquire their undying admiration. 
LEO, The best planetary aspects now relate to financial interests, but you must stifle any tendency to leap ahead without considering the consequences. Generous gestures are fine if you expect nothing in return, otherwise direct your efforts where they are going to be appreciated. 
VIRGO, In so many ways you set up difficulties for yourself. It's in your nature to seek the rocky road and to refuse offers of assistance. If I were you, though, I'd look around for sources of support, mainly from anyone who can help you understand your conflicting emotions. 
LIBRA, You do tend to be a little over-concerned with appearances, but during the next week or so you will begin to be surprisingly disinterested in others' attitudes and opinions. You will discover that life can be so much more relaxing when you do what you want! 
SCORPIO, Over the past few weeks you appear to have veered between self-doubt on the one hand and a deep belief in your own destiny on the other. Now you'll have the chance to find stability in the company of sensible people, but that might mean considering options you'd always turned down. 
SAGITTARIUS, A lot of troubled waters have passed under the bridge in the past. However, as far as your worldly ambitions are concerned, the position is looking bright. Imminent events at work follow on from good fortune as far back as ten years ago, perhaps events which affected people very close to you. 
CAPRICORN, After a lot of trials and tribulations, the next six months could be a relatively pleasant time for most of you. As from now, you should start to consolidate all your gains, however small and apparently insignificant. You should also see to it that all outstanding emotional business is dealt with. AQUARIUS Stick up for yourself and don't allow others' lack of faith or imagination to dim your vision of the future. You have no reason to feel that just because partners don't understand you, you have to rein yourself in. It's time to plough your own furrow, to do your own thing. 
GEMINI, Personally and emotionally this could be quite a complex and challenging time, but not, it must be stressed, because your planets are in a sensitive mood. Everything arises from the plain fact that you're not quite sure what you want at home. CANCER Financial arrangements should now be completed and your course for the coming period may be set. Remember that your next twelve months should be relatively prosperous, so don't let doubts creep in now. What you have to do first is break out of the patterns which have lost you money in the past. 
LEO, It's a day for business, but not for major long-term decisions. Your judgment is bound to suffer, so don't be taken in by amazing offers or wonderful promises - they'll probably fail to materialise. On the other hand every idea needs to be considered because you can't yet say which one is going to yield dividends, including emotional ones. 
VIRGO, There is a slight tendency to get carried away and ignore all those obvious pitfalls. Over the next few days your judgment will deteriorate. Artistic and romantic Virgos will benefit, but if you've detailed matters to consider, take care - very great care indeed. 
LIBRA, Most of your problems at the moment seem to emanate from feeling slightly restricted. Yet you'll probably find it difficult to put your finger on what exactly is happening, and to whom. It all depends on your personal situation, so don't judge other people too harshly. 
SCORPIO, This is definitely not an ideal time to try to arrange discussions or meetings. By the beginning of next week, though, you'll discover that other people are more sympathetic to your aims, even if they do still fail to comprehend the real inner you. 
SAGITTARIUS, Changes at home are a distinct possibility. However, if by any chance you are dreaming of a move or similar substantial improvements, the indications are complex, and driven by regrets and resentment over what happened in the past. In this case you must rely on yourself. 
CAPRICORN, You find it so easy to confuse the wood with the trees that you may leave yourself in an awful muddle. Do continue to take extra care when travelling, and be sure to let others know what you're up to. The fact is, you like to be liked and you'll never forgive yourself if you think you've let a special person down. AQUARIUS Financial affairs are about to get more intense, not less, so I doubt if you've anything to gain from ignoring a problem in the hope that it will go away. A friend, possibly female, is about to come to your aid, but the funny thing is that you might not find out about it for another three or four weeks. 
GEMINI, You often have it all your own way, mainly by the simple art of spreading your options around but, on many recent occasions, people have expected you to cave in and agree to their demands. The situation is now shifting quite rapidly, and you will be urged to stand your ground and not give way. CANCER No matter how stressful the past few months have seemed, it is time for plain thinking. Even those Cancerians who have been on a high must now take a very down-to-earth and matter-of-fact approach to all personal matters. In other words, take control! 
LEO, The focus is on other people. This means, inevitably, that you must stand aside and allow partners, colleagues and friends to hog the limelight. If you attempt to take the lead, you must expect to be unceremoniously toppled. But if you're generous in defeat then your chivalry will never be forgotten. 
VIRGO, You may have to be on the move, but there is no knowing what can be accomplished personally and professionally. As long as Mercury, planet of thought and reason, is moving so erratically, the future remains obscure, but that's because the possibilities are so amazing. 
LIBRA, Although an indirect approach may be best, you could still fail to get your message across. If, on the other hand, you are dealing with insoluble mysteries and intangible questions, you may be on safer ground. Also, of course, your individual gifts are becoming more marked by the day. 
SCORPIO, You're probably going to have little choice but to deal with domestic questions or family affairs. There's just no way certain people can be properly handled if you only allow them a little of your time. Do your bit and give them all the attention they need. 
SAGITTARIUS, In spite of your reputation for being a tower of strength, you do have a number of reservations about allowing other people to rely on you. Neither should you permit anyone to push you too far. It seems that your best policy is to establish proper boundaries. 
CAPRICORN, Let's turn our attention back to the amazing alignments of Jupiter and Saturn. You really do seem to believe that it is your prerogative to put the world to rights, and you may well be quite correct. But watch out, because you might also have to foot the bill. AQUARIUS By rights the day should kick off to a good start although I'll wager that more of you than usual will have experienced some sort of strange dream or broken night. Whatever is on your plate, domestic questions are not about to answer themselves, so get down to the nitty-gritty. 
GEMINI, In love, the golden rule is to keep talking. If you make sure that a partner knows what you're thinking, then you'll steer clear of potential pitfalls. If you're planning a shopping trip, you may wish to concentrate on luxuries rather than necessities. Plus, please put your ideas across with confidence. CANCER There's a difference between being assertive and aggressive. It's right that you stand up for yourself, but don't throw your weight around; otherwise you may take on more than you bargained for. You would do better to exercise a little tact and seduce people with your poetic tongue. It is your sweet words which win the day. 
LEO, What a fantastic combination of stars you're under! Mars will help you get the better of anybody. Jupiter will ensure that you are successful. If it's love you're after, you may have to be a little devious - just a little, mind you! You may double-book yourself socially. At the heart of the matter is money and your future security. 
VIRGO, Even if you have other ideas, home and family matters will impose themselves upon your time, not to mention your good nature. The key to success lies in a simple change of attitude. If you can make relations, children, parents, and anyone else you live with, see the world anew, so much the better. 
LIBRA, You may take an easy-going approach at work, but assert yourself socially. In other words, let colleagues get away with murder professionally, but let friends know just what you want. When it comes to ideas and opinions, you should give fantasy preference over the facts. Stick to your principles and your chances of success sharply increase. 
SCORPIO, Happy to say, there's nothing wrong with a spot of day-dreaming this week. In fact, those of you who give full rein to your imaginations, instincts and visions of the future will be on the ball, far more than those safe souls who choose to play by the so-called facts. 
SAGITTARIUS, A spot of financial confusion should be in the past, and you may be able to get back on to a steady footing. At work, share your ideas and let everyone know what you're thinking. Keep your feelings to yourself, though, otherwise family and friends will see just how businesslike you are! 
CAPRICORN, The prospects for love are good, perhaps best at the weekend. Financial trends look equally promising, even though expenditure will probably exceed income. At work you should spread yourself around as much as possible, keeping all the balls in the air at once. You have to tell a few home-truths, but pick your words with care. AQUARIUS If you're planning changes at home, stop and think for a moment. You'll find that although you believe you know what you want, it is not easy to translate your dreams into practice. If you can get away with a major social initiative, so much the better. Your enthusiasm could win over the doubters. 
GEMINI, It's a favourable weekend for getting financial plans into shape. Forge ahead with all family arrangements and hope for the best: someone may be arranging a pleasant surprise for you. The best way to tackle domestic ructions is to be totally practical and stick to the facts. Try to take partners' minds off their woes. CANCER Why is it that people at home seem determined to disagree with your plans or think up problems to slow you down? Perhaps it's because you failed to consult them when you were dreaming up your current schemes. In that case, you'd better try to persuade them you did it for their own good. 
LEO, You may keep on the move this weekend, though you could be happier making short journeys rather than long. Push business matters to one side and enjoy your social life free of the cares and concerns which tend to cloud your vision. You may be a little more emotional than usual, but do try to keep your cool. 
VIRGO, A partnership dispute or a delay in communications should clear very soon, if it has not already done so. Turn your back on fantasy and waffle, and concentrate on what you can do of practical value. Plus, you must avoid a financial risk, especially if you're responsible for other people's money. 
LIBRA, You could be in for a romantic weekend, especially if you're single. If you're spoken for, cheer up, for there is still plenty of scope for you and your partner to give life an exciting new twist. In love, partners should defer to your superior wisdom. 
SCORPIO, Anything which is set in motion today should have a rewarding outcome. However, there is much that still needs to be explained and you may be labouring under one or two misapprehensions. You're keeping a romantic secret, and a discreet flirtation is now a distinct possibility. 
SAGITTARIUS, If you've any spare time, you may wish to devote a little energy to your long-term interests, especially your investments and savings. Most of the indications suggest that ventures entered into now will eventually prove very profitable, but you must think them through very carefully indeed. 
CAPRICORN, It's a romantic weekend in the broadest sense. Quite aside from the intimate, emotional side of your life, you will be looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles. Exotic cultures may beckon, but you must love partners for who they are, rather than for who you'd like them to be. AQUARIUS A restless mood may make it difficult to concentrate, but there will be rewards if you find yourself in unfamiliar surroundings. Social gatherings have much to offer, but only if you are prepared to leap into the unknown, ready for absolutely anything. 
GEMINI, Today's dominant planetary alignment opens the door to a brave new future. You may now begin to see the sense in family differences or domestic pressures that until now have seemed somewhat pointless. You'll set out to increase your physical fitness - or recover lost health. CANCER As a matter of principle, you should acknowledge that there is some truth in other people's opinions even if you personally feel that they are completely and utterly wrong. You must concede the possibility that it is you who is profoundly mistaken. 
LEO, Tie up loose ends and get trivialities out of the way before you make any more bold moves. You might have bright ideas of your own, but you may be wise to sit back and let others call the shots for a while. Otherwise, you could get the flak if plans go awry. 
VIRGO, Life may still be a little fraught and unpredictable. If you are sure that all expected dramatic events have now taken place, you may begin to pick up the pieces and wonder where you go from here. For now, you need to keep a level head at home, seeing relations' points of view. 
LIBRA, You have been playing the romantic lead for long enough. However, there's no need to come down to earth just yet. Hopefully, you have by now recovered from a recent fright or upset. You'll be keeping your plans to yourself, but there's nothing wrong with that! 
SCORPIO, Social stars are still strong, but your plans may have been altered by what friends and acquaintances have done or said in the last twenty four hours, or perhaps over the past week. In the present circumstances, you can't go too far wrong if you stick to what you know to be right. 
SAGITTARIUS, Even though the planets are activating a number of areas of your chart, the emphasis is still solidly on your financial affairs. There doesn't seem any way around the fact that this is a high-spending period. But you must beware of con-merchants offering ridiculous promises. 
CAPRICORN, Unlooked-for benefits will be an added bonus in all group activities. However, you may prefer the intimacy of one-to-one relationships, which is where the real gains will lie. Meanwhile, your charming manner is paying welcome dividends at work. AQUARIUS It is difficult to know just where you should turn. If you wish, you may put pressing and important matters on hold and spend your way to happiness. This is, without doubt, an extravagant phase, though you can help yourself by getting every guarantee on the market. 
GEMINI, You can ignore family pressures or domestic irritations no longer. Today's steamy Lunar angle will give you the chance to deal with all long-delayed questions. Don't expect instant agreement or approval though, as it's just one of those times when everyone has their own opinion. CANCER Important discussions may be more difficult than you anticipate. The simple reason is that everybody seems to place such unrealistic hopes on the outcome. Stick to your guns for now, otherwise partners will imagine that you're a right old push-over. 
LEO, The financial news may not be what you expected, but the net result could be positive if it enables you to reorganise your affairs. There are some commitments which cannot be changed, but you still have some room for movement. In love, it's time to tell someone how you feel about them. You can keep quiet no longer. 
VIRGO, Your current planetary aspects will offer you a shot in the arm, shaking you out of any complacent corners or ruts you've been hiding in. Don't expect dramatic events just yet - you may have to wait a few more days before the lie of the land is clear. 
LIBRA, Something may happen to worry or upset you. Perhaps you will feel that other people are blaming you unfairly for things you haven't done. However, such concerns are illusions which will be dispelled when the facts are known. But that might not be until late next week. 
SCORPIO, You'll enjoy social activities all the more if you are ready for anything and happy to join in without worrying about the consequences. Don't be hung up on excessively conventional standards of behaviour. Instead, you may try to carve an individual path for yourself. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is professional rather than private affairs which are the focus of your concern today. The last thing you want to do is get involved in a quite unnecessary public slanging match, so watch your step. You may not be in the wrong but, then, nobody will care whose fault it is! 
CAPRICORN, The planets are on your case so to speak. The cosmos is expecting you to do your duty by combining self-interest with your higher principles. Quite apart from such lofty questions, you are still experiencing powerful travel stars. You may even go exploring new lands. AQUARIUS Check out new investment opportunities, and don't be unduly concerned if a previous course of action now appears to be distinctly unpromising or unprofitable. You'll act fast but keep your options open, just in case circumstances change as fast for you as they have done for others. 
GEMINI, Some happy surprises could affect money matters or home affairs. This looks like a fine time to stabilise and formalise domestic arrangements which, until now, may have been left up in the air, and there is much to be said for leaving awkward issues alone until you're on safer ground. CANCER The whole mood of the day encourages formal settings, traditional behaviour and conservative values, so do try to fit in. It may even be fun to enter into the fantasy of living in a past age. There could soon be a sharp change in your financial circumstances, so keep an eye open for new opportunities. 
LEO, Your home and working life are well-starred, but you must be aware of an approaching financial crisis. Get your affairs in order and act now if there are any outstanding bills to pay or loans to call in. If you have become overloaded by emotional burdens this could be the moment to cut loose. 
VIRGO, The tension is now building up, as it does once or twice a month when the planets form certain intense patterns. You are now reaching a moment of decision and will at last be forced to get off the fence. Actually, you will welcome a return to the fray. 
LIBRA, You may feel reasonably justified in expecting a response to a recent suggestion or, at the very least, an answer to an important question. However, planetary activity over the coming days may muddy the waters even further, before clarity is restored next week. 
SCORPIO, For once you are trying to be rational while others are losing their heads. Any changes that you are anxious to put into effect may involve more people than you at first thought. This is why you must grit your teeth and discuss even your personal plans with friends and acquaintances. 
SAGITTARIUS, It is at the most trivial level that your grand plans are capable of coming unstuck. So, issues of principle are all very well, but you would be advised to focus on routine and mundane details. You seem to be dominated by past feelings and actions and you'll need to make an almighty effort to bring yourself into the present. 
CAPRICORN, Restless conditions could make it difficult to settle down, so it may be better to get around and explore fresh possibilities. Is there a legal complication to resolve? If so, get on to it without delay. The best ideas could be offered by family members, so if it's advice you're after, look close to home. AQUARIUS Long-standing money problems may be coming home to roost. Yet, rather than feel sorry for yourself, or dwell on what might have been, adopt an attitude of business as usual and compensate for any losses. Imminent changes at work may find you blaming others, but don't hit the wrong target. 
GEMINI, Mercury, planet of the mind, is currently of little help to most people, but is a powerful support for you. You can therefore be sure that your advances will not be rebuffed, and that your romantic wishes will be granted. The final results, though, may not be what you expect. CANCER There seems little question that you are going through a restless phase, and you may be looking to other people to satisfy your need for variety. However, partners may turn to you for support. At work, it is who you know that counts, so you may cultivate people in authority. 
LEO, Astrology is all about choices, and right now you must decide between a course of blatant self-interest and a path of self-sacrifice and service to others. Search out the middle way and don't get too het up. Mars' changing motion signifies more relaxed conditions, so enjoy a brief breathing space. 
VIRGO, As the Sun feels Mars' relentless emotional intensity over the coming two weeks you will approach a break with the past, possibly severing one particular involvement. You may act now to shape the future to your needs or risk being taken over by fate during the coming few months. 
LIBRA, On the surface, you can be so charming, and everything seems to be going so well. But life is never that straightforward, and you must accept that, in part, you are driven by irritation or resentment about the past. Your naturally gracious manners will stand you in good stead in coming discussions. 
SCORPIO, The emphasis is on the lighter side of life, which should come as a relief. You can afford to push dull routine to one side and get on with enjoyable matters. Serious discussions are in the pipeline, though, and the next week's invitations will help change your long-term direction. 
SAGITTARIUS, If it's prestige that you want, you must know that you will earn the respect of your peers and colleagues through following a fairly traditional path. Having established your position, you must now consolidate your achievements and decide whether you are going to stick with a long-term tie, or break it for good. 
CAPRICORN, Beneficial travel stars are continuing. If anything, the current planetary influences are more helpful for global connections and adventurous journeys than those which have dominated your chart so often over recent months. Hopefully, changing circumstances will permit you to have a break. AQUARIUS You could hardly hope for better planetary allies than Mercury and Venus if romantic life and entertaining are on the agenda, but only if you are prepared to put in the extra effort. It seems very likely that the most significant social news could come from abroad. You'll be broadening your horizons and deepening your desires. 
GEMINI, The stars are superb for financial transactions, including property deals, whether selling or buying. Mind you, the first thing you need to do is get your facts straight! Otherwise planetary potential will do you no good. Plus, it's your last day for keeping emotional secrets. The truth will be out next week. CANCER The general tone of the times is optimistic, although as always, there is a chance that your hopes could be raised too high. Make a point of pushing your schemes forward and try to persuade partners that your ideas are best. You're in a suspicious mood, but don't let that blind you to the truth. 
LEO, You may expect your hard work and efforts to be rewarded financially, perhaps through extra savings, perhaps as a result of increased earnings. Such good fortune may not take place today, but within six days you will have seen your efforts bear fruit. 
VIRGO, When the Sun encounters both vivacious Venus and magnificent Mars, the only response that is justified is one of awe at all that life has to offer. To fully appreciate just how well you are doing, you must raise your sights from routine drudgery and focus on the wonder of the world. 
LIBRA, Friends could soon be seeing important questions in a new light. It is amazing, is it not, how easy you find it to persuade people that you are right? You must, though, make an effort to please. Good news from a partner should be on the way, although you may have to wait two or three days. 
SCORPIO, There's much happening that is difficult to explain. However, rather than flounder around in a sea of confusion, may I suggest that all vague and muddled questions are left on one side for the time being. Otherwise partners will think you've let them down. 
SAGITTARIUS, For the next six days your planets point to one conclusion: all your past professional and financial efforts and struggles are soon to be rewarded in such a manner as to show you that it was all worth while. Emotional ties though, will be particularly unreliable. You have been warned! 
CAPRICORN, You still have a great deal to gain from other people, though not necessarily in a material sense. You have much to learn, for example, in terms of having the courage of your convictions and the determination to stick to what you know to be absolutely right and proper. AQUARIUS You're not alone in believing that financial affairs are essentially mysterious and impossible to explain. Yet, this week, you must have faith that even developments of which you may be completely unaware, are in your best interests. The stress level in close relationships is about to dip sharply. 
GEMINI, In many respects life has been a bit gruelling over recent weeks, mainly because the planets have been in unhelpful positions. Now that Mercury, your planetary ruler, is changing signs, your fortunes will improve. Plus, your stars are about to assume a more prosperous dimension - if you can wait until next month! CANCER It's energetic Mars and mystical Neptune which get you going this week and next. One moment you'll be floating on cloud nine, the next you'll be down in the dumps after your hopes are deflated. Try and find a middle way! The only problem may be friends who seem determined to misunderstand and misconstrue your every word. 
LEO, You have much to boast about, but you must remember the virtues of humility! The effects of recent lunar alignments are still too strong for you to abandon important commitments or break arrangements. Remember that as a Leo you have a duty to protect friends and relatives who are less well-off than you. 
VIRGO, Very gradually the stars are moving from a creative and personally fulfilling position, to one that is going to bring more in the way of hard work. In the meantime, make the most of children's company. Moneywise, you're approaching a period of rewards and windfalls but not just yet - first of all you have to sow the seeds. 
LIBRA, Travel still seems to be very strongly indicated in your stars. However, journeys undertaken for purely personal reasons will be much more significant than those connected to work and other responsibilities. Your romantic stars are excellent and will remain so for at least another six months. 
SCORPIO, Mercury, the planet of communication, takes up a more encouraging aspect to your sign, an indication that your mood is about to improve. Put forward your own unique ideas with the confidence they deserve. If you're frustrated at work, you must be prepared to wait another month or so for difficulties to shift. 
SAGITTARIUS, With Jupiter, your ruling planet, so strongly placed, what can go wrong? 'Not much' is the answer, so you can afford to be confident. That doesn't mean that you must start throwing your money around, though! There is every opportunity for getting out and meeting new people. Take advantage of bright and bubbly invitations. 
CAPRICORN, Energetic Mars forms its next alignment with nebulous Neptune very soon, causing much confusion. This is, to put it mildly, not the best time to deal with any complicated practical issues unless you first check out the legal background. You must, repeat must, do your best to put colleagues, associates and friends at their ease. AQUARIUS Mercury, that most witty and versatile of planets, has entered your sign, bringing a much-needed shot of energy. Use this time wisely by arranging meetings, interviews and discussions at which you can put over your point of view. And, intriguingly, vivacious Venus lends an air of mystery to romantic encounters. 
GEMINI, It's time to get tough, yet I doubt if anyone can do so as charmingly as you. It's very much a question of the iron fist in the velvet glove, your firm resolve delivered in the nicest possible way. Your strength is, you see, that you are about to be proved right! CANCER Passion is in the air. Certain personal encounters may be tremendously exciting. One or two experiences might be rather too blunt for your liking, though! Monetary affairs and expenses could be the only significant cause of discord but, even then, deeper emotional motives are most important. 
LEO, Involvements which once seemed so desirable, no longer hold out the promise they offered at first. It looks very much, though, as if someone has seen through your little game. Perhaps you should have been more straightforward about your real, personal needs. 
VIRGO, There is a lot to be said for keeping your distance yet, right now, I would advise you to move closer to other people, especially emotionally. It may not be easy to express your real feelings, but do have a go. If anything can be done to change a partner's mind, do it! 
LIBRA, A long-standing relationship or involvement has been going through a stressful phase, but you now have the opportunity to set matters straight. Domestic repairs should be a priority if good feeling is to be restored. Get practical problems fixed and other questions will be resolved. 
SCORPIO, You have certainly done a great deal to safeguard your long-term health and security. If other people have also benefited from your efforts, you may expect a word of thanks. However, you may have to accept that gratitude is not an emotion that partners are likely to feel. 
SAGITTARIUS, You're happiest when everything is out in the open. This is why you may not have an easy time when the causes of current problems lie deep in the past, perhaps in a partner's background rather than yours. This is even more reason why you should try to be sympathetic and understanding. 
CAPRICORN, Adverse aspects to planets in strategic sectors of your solar chart are pushing you into getting your act together properly for a change. This particularly relates to your willingness to share information and discuss plans with the people who matter most. AQUARIUS Stand your ground but don't expect partners to back down. The best solution might be an honourable compromise in which you both agree to pursue your separate goals. An amicable reconciliation will then be the next step. That will leave you free to get back together when you wish. 
GEMINI, The Moon now gives you the advantage, for it obliges everyone to think like you. Those who continue with their old ways will be out-smarted by your sheer wit and instinctive grasp of the situation. But what you've really got to do is to look at the big picture. CANCER That rather obstreperous planet Pluto is stirring strange thoughts, vague hopes and irrational worries from the unconscious. Money could be the catalyst that causes a relationship to hit the rocks. But you could also be slightly uneasy about work. 
LEO, There are few things more downcast than a bored or frustrated Leo. But with Mars and Mercury rapidly manoeuvring themselves into fresh positions, you must avoid taking your personal feelings out on other people. The fact that there may have been delays is nothing to do with them. 
VIRGO, Although you may believe that it is up to others to accept your proposals, the plain truth is that they are unlikely to do so. The reason may be that your ideas do not go far enough to cover all eventualities. That is not in itself a problem, but it does mean that you should cut your coat according to your cloth. 
LIBRA, Did you know that Libra is the sign of diplomats and generals? Probably not, but the connection here is a strategy. In other words, if you now have a game plan worked out in advance, and follow it through with determination, nothing will stand in your way. 
SCORPIO, It definitely looks as if people you live with are in a mischievous mood. Don't take umbrage if a partner says something in jest which may be taken as offensive - it is not meant to upset. It may just be that they are currently not thinking straight. 
SAGITTARIUS, You are renowned for your rapid changes in mood. Quickness to anger can also mean a willingness to forgive. Now that the planets are assuming a belligerent pose, your contribution can be to see to it that old wounds play no part in current discussions. 
CAPRICORN, It's the fact that you were born under an earth sign that makes you so wonderfully efficient. Other people don't necessarily share your talents, so even though you still feel they are letting you down or failing to pull their weight, give them the benefit of the doubt. AQUARIUS During the next few weeks, while the Sun is in such a civilised region of your solar chart, you must ensure that any alterations in both your earnings and' joint arrangements will be to your long-term advantage. You will be no good to anybody if you're worried about money. 
GEMINI, Mercury is making a very rare alignment with Jupiter, suggesting that you will only get by if you have as broad an appreciation of the facts as possible. All your past experiences, no matter how trivial, could now help you to victory. CANCER The winds of change seem to have slackened off a little, although I would advise you against dropping your guard. Complacency is the Cancerian's worst enemy at the present time - especially if you forget just how sensitive close partners can be. 
LEO, A change, it is said, is as good as a rest. Now that the Sun, your planetary ruler, is cruising through laid-back Pisces, why don't you push onerous responsibilities to one side and put your feet up? One thing though - don't take foolish financial risks. 
VIRGO, Ever since Mercury altered its position you have been dreaming up new schemes to make your work-load easier. It should now become clear to all but the most obstinate Virgo that part of the answer lies in co-operation with people you have badly misjudged. 
LIBRA, Don't worry if you have a difficult day, as the evening should be considerably more to your liking. The whole point is that you've had enough of partners'; or family members'; endless demands and complaints. Isn't it time they praised you instead? I think so! 
SCORPIO, The news that your two celestial rulers, Mars and Pluto, are so finely positioned, can only do you good. What's more, in the long run, life can only get better. Yet tread carefully, for decisions you make now, especially financial ones, will have a major impact in a couple of weeks. 
SAGITTARIUS, Just when you thought all was lost, a new scheme is likely to pop into your head. You should be open and ready to accept whatever happens, and also prepared to take the flak when people realise what you're up to. Stand by your guns and stick up for the truth. 
CAPRICORN, This really is the lull before the storm. Yet unlike some previous battles, this one will be firmly rooted in specific issues, such as money. Not only that but this time you will have a number of important allies on your side. One of the chiefs of these is your own confidence! AQUARIUS Nobody can accuse you of being blinkered, but the Moon inclines you to ignore those facts or elementary truths which don't happen to suit you. If you can get away with taking no notice of the facts, well done! But, if you can't, then you'd better take good care! 
GEMINI, Much has been said and written about your financial complications. All I can add now is a reminder that you are still fighting on several fronts, but that within a few weeks the situation will be substantially eased. First, Mercury, your planetary ruler, has to get out of its current scrape. CANCER Various planets, each in their different ways, bring you some pretty bright financial ideas. However, you must move immediately towards putting your plans into effect if you are not to meet a rising tide of opposition. But, then, a little friction may be inevitable - perhaps even useful. 
LEO, The long-term effect of your current stars is difficult to gauge. What we can say with some certainty is that the general drift this week is towards the clarification of certain personal issues that, until now, have remained irritatingly vague. 
VIRGO, You may be extremely pleased to hear that there could be a happy ending to a rather bizarre story. You might decide that the only way forward now is to put the past behind you and pretend that nothing happened. But then that's not really the case, is it? 
LIBRA, An extraordinary amount of planetary activity has been teaching you a firm lesson, namely that a house built on foundations of straw will not do. It is time to be more settled. In a sense, you also have to face up to the real world. And not before time! 
SCORPIO, The time is fast approaching when you will have to think about terminating one particular involvement. The weekend may be a better time for taking a final decision and breaking the news than now. But some of you may decide that next week would be even better! 
SAGITTARIUS, You must get a move on, or miss the boat. Mercury will not spend long in highly favourable and friendly parts of your chart. You should, therefore, do what you can over the next two weeks to splash out, experimenting with different options, however unlikely. 
CAPRICORN, A separation, or parting of the ways, may have left you feeling rather bruised. Yet whatever was done in the heat of the moment may still be undone, if you so wish. It's all a question of commitment. It's also a question of working out just why you feel as you do. AQUARIUS You are renowned for your sheer inventive genius. Let's hope that teachers, employers, colleagues and relatives are now prepared to give you the space to play around with some of your more special ideas. You should take care that nobody misunderstands your real intentions, though. 
GEMINI, It's your intuition which holds the key to financial success. The only question is how you can judge between different options on something so vague as a general hunch? You may have no choice but to take a gamble. Events over the following few days will show whether you were right - or not! CANCER The Sun's constructive relationship with your sign is complemented by another fine alignment from the Moon - one which will get you moving. All you need to do to extract the greatest benefit is broaden your horizons and genuinely take partners'; interests into account. 
LEO, Pride and egotism are the Leonine vices. Today you have the chance to practise humility. What makes the present time special is because you may discover that, ironically, your own interests may be best served by putting other people first - and not for the first time. 
VIRGO, The Sun is now aligned with a sensitive sector of your solar chart. This will have various consequences, one of which will be to get your conscience working even harder than usual. In love, give a partner the benefit of the doubt. After all, if you don't know what's going on, why should they! 
LIBRA, According to the ancient astrologers, the Sun's present position is a highly fortunate one, on the grounds that your love of peace and harmony is good for everyone. Make the most of current responsibilities to help someone else out of a tight spot. 
SCORPIO, Don't take too much notice of what other people say or imply; the blunt fact is that they just don't have your appreciation of what has been going on, especially the subtler aspects of inter-personal relationships. Let unkind words bounce off you like water off a duck's back. 
SAGITTARIUS, By rights, you feel as if you should only have to snap your fingers to get what you want. And why not? Yet if there is one lesson you have been absorbing over the winter it is that you must be prepared to put your ideas into practice yourself, without relying on other people. 
CAPRICORN, The Moon is in an intimate relationship with Jupiter. This sets up a number of possible feelings ranging from wild optimism to reckless extravagance. The only risk with high expectations is that they may be out of step with what is realistically possible. AQUARIUS A baffling atmosphere may be followed by an entirely more reasonable mood later on. Yet you will still probably have only the slightest grasp on what is really happening. But it's not only you. People around you may also be picking up the wrong end of the stick! 
GEMINI, The week's stars begin on a high note, but as the days pass, argumentative influences will creep in. You must, therefore, be aware that what seems like a golden opportunity now could turn into quite the opposite by next weekend. Also, harsh words today could rebound on you later. CANCER You've been wondering what happened to all your alleged good fortune. Well, today's intriguing planetary patterns provide a pretty good guarantee that events are moving your way. All you have to do is get on the train while it's moving - and hang on tight. 
LEO, In many respects, you fare better than most at the moment because you have the wit to see a personal situation for what it really is. I doubt if anyone will be able to pull the wool over your eyes. You may even realise that cast-iron practical arrangements might not work out after all. 
VIRGO, You are now going through a rather peculiar phase, perhaps because you're not really sure what you want. Try to be a bit more at ease and relaxed with the world in general, without swinging to the other extreme and becoming disorganised and chaotic. 
LIBRA, It's time to say another word to all Librans who are in the throes of domestic change - that there is only another fortnight of confusion. In fact, all of you will find it easier to straighten out family complications next month, which has to be good news. 
SCORPIO, You may imagine that everything at home is just fine and hunky-dory. However, it's just at times like these that you must take extra precautions. Do your very best to see that family members are happy and contented - even if they're not! I have a feeling you'll soon have some making up to do! 
SAGITTARIUS, You will soon share with your fellow fire signs, Leo and Aries, a superb, if challenging, planetary line-up. However, your optimism may be tempered by the knowledge that in some senses even you may now be out of your depth. It's time to rely on your past experience. 
CAPRICORN, Partners, loved ones and close colleagues are about to start moving back to an optimistic high after a few weeks of uncertainty. You may both help them develop their good feelings, and share in their success. You should also help them face up to the truth. AQUARIUS You're an Aquarian, so nobody can really put you on the spot or undermine your confidence unless you allow them to. However, judicious concessions made now will prevent them even making the attempt. Your judgement and timing are crucial, and I suspect that you'll be walking a tightrope - temporarily. 
GEMINI, There definitely seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes. You may be right in insisting that something needs explaining, but what exactly? The air of general mystery is such that you may have to wait a little while longer for the dust to settle, or the fog to clear. Plus, set aside some time for pleasure. CANCER Jupiter, that wisest of planets, is still offering its assistance, as is Saturn, symbol of control and discipline. This is a dynamic combination which presents you with the opportunity to set routine chores to one side and pursue some of your intensely personal ambitions, especially romantic ones. 
LEO, Career-minded Leos are making good progress. For once in your life you're getting on well both because of what you know and who you know. However, for all Leos the chances of emotional and irrational confrontation are strong, especially on Tuesday and Wednesday. Watch out for the warning signs and take evasive action. 
VIRGO, You have another week of pleasure, although some of your enjoyment will come from pursuing activities which are sensible, worthwhile and designed to help others as much as please you. Be prepared for the sparks to fly at home early in the week, but expect plenty of fun and excitement as well; the two seem to go together! 
LIBRA, Finally, the personal stress level drops. Tuesday and Wednesday emphasise your financial affairs. The Moon indicates a reluctance to increase your expenses, but there are other signs that domestic costs may be about to escalate. This may be no bad thing, especially if you are reaping the rewards of a partner's worldly success. 
SCORPIO, You stand to benefit more than most people from this week's stunning Martian movements. Those areas of your life which will receive a fresh shot of inspiration include all overseas contacts and connections, higher education and legal questions. Partners will share your general good fortune - you'll see to that. 
SAGITTARIUS, Your financial stars have been strong for a number of months now, so much so that your attitudes to money may have been through a complete U-turn. You're now entering a brief period when you'll be much better at giving money away than earning it. Indulge your charitable instincts, and always do your best by partners. 
CAPRICORN, A rare moment of inspiration is coming your way but, like a mirage, it may disappear as soon as you try to grasp it. The next weekend may be the ideal romantic moment, but please don't expect your hopes to work out in the way you planned. The stars may have different ideas! AQUARIUS You may feel a little overburdened with responsibilities. However, astrology is all about changing attitudes, so try to see this phase of your life as a valuable one to be of service to other people. Your turn to be waited on will come soon. Be patient! And make sure that you consolidate every single gain you've made. 
GEMINI, As a new astrological cycle begins, why not hold back and let the dust settle before pressing ahead with financial enterprises. It may be that recent personnel changes have resulted in a changed situation, one which may be more to your liking. CANCER Your planets are hitting a vigorous note. This has been a strange period for many Cancerians. Some of you have come through unscathed but others are now in need of all the love and affection you can get in order to restore your battered morale. 
LEO, Let me temper your confidence and enthusiasm with a long-term consideration: in about three weeks you will enter a period of domestic or family change. Therefore, why don't you use your present position to lay foundations for the future? Use your grey matter - and think ahead. 
VIRGO, Be positive. And if you can't be positive at least don't be gloomy! It is fortunate that irrational fears will no longer hold you back, but there is no reason why you should allow them to succeed. You have far too much to gain from pressing forward to be put off, now. 
LIBRA, Happily, continuing positive patterns coming from the Sun, Venus, Mercury and Saturn should deal with your lingering insecurities and give you the nerve to deal with people whose actions have, perhaps unwittingly, undermined your self-confidence. 
SCORPIO, Mars, your tough planetary ruler, is now doing its very best. For the first time it may be possible to gauge and predict the future progress of your ambitions, at least over the next three weeks. I'd say it's about another seven weeks before you're completely in the clear, though. 
SAGITTARIUS, Energetic Mars is reinforcing your adventurous instincts and this is indeed a suitable time for a holiday, other commitments permitting! Intriguing travel influences continue for many weeks, so take your time. And, if you are held back by work and family commitments, try to make them as enjoyable as you can. 
CAPRICORN, You'll be in fighting form and the battle over the latest financial or business matters may have only just begun. Yet please do not set up aunt-sallies where no problem existed, or fight imaginary and time-consuming battles. In other words, please stick to the facts! AQUARIUS Now that passionate Mars' deepening relationship to your sign is taking hold, you are beginning to see that this is a time of excitement and energy. Many astrologers say that periods such as this are the most creative and fulfilling. It's certainly potentially prosperous. 
GEMINI, Because the belligerent planet Mars is triggering a communicative region of your chart, you will have no choice but to come clean and put your arguments forward with commitment and determination. But, once you've won the day, you have to show you can come up with the goods. CANCER You may try to forget the past, but with a memory like yours it's not that easy! You must speedily bring a period of confrontation to a final full stop and look for ways to reinstate a particular person into the fold. You may now hope that an emotional relationship is about to blossom. 
LEO, That fiery planet Mars is exerting a potent influence on your affairs, inaugurating a period of steadily mounting excitement. You must take risks if need be, but paradoxically only once you're sure of the outcome. Plus, take nothing for granted, however easy your path may seem. 
VIRGO, There are sound astrological reasons why you should not be unduly disturbed by tendencies which in normal circumstances would be very worrying. Yet do take notice of unconscious desires which have until now been suppressed. If you're fed up with delays, then hang on; there's only another couple of weeks to go. 
LIBRA, It may now become apparent that colleagues are in a position to compromise, which should come as a relief. Shift your energy to other areas, in particular towards a determined broadening of your objectives. There's something just over the horizon, and you're going to enjoy it! 
SCORPIO, Like many people, you are going to have to re-orientate your opinions and attitudes if you are to keep up with the times. You should now cut out the waffle and fix your sights on an immediate professional goal. You might also want to rearrange a stalled social venture. 
SAGITTARIUS, At your best, putting others' needs first comes naturally to you. At your worst, you take people for a ride without offering anything in return. Please do try and find a middle way between these extremes. Especially, and this is important, at work: the last thing you want to do now is make rash promises you can't keep. 
CAPRICORN, Although you have come to a position where you prefer to face situations head- on, it may no longer be necessary to do so. Opposition may now vanish like a desert mirage, to be replaced by a surprisingly friendly atmosphere. If travel plans are coming unstuck, don't panic - just keep them on hold. AQUARIUS Put your thoughts and ideas into action through a creative and artistic approach. In other words, bring your own individual, unique talents to bear on questions that have so far been characterised by routine and boredom. And once you have made the grade, you'll receive the praise you deserve. 
GEMINI, Although everything now indicates that you are in a position to resolve a number of options and even to make a decisive move, other people still seem to be either unreliable or unprepared to co-operate. But, then, that's a state of affairs you're rapidly getting used to. CANCER Your world is one of frustration and discord on the one hand, deep satisfaction and fulfilment on the other. People in your circle fall into two camps; those who are inspiring you to new heights and those who are responsible for holding you back. Make your choices now! 
LEO, Vivacious Venus in a sensitive region of your chart endows you with a tendency to manipulate people who are outside your normal field of control. However, by the weekend you will come into the open, demanding that partners acknowledge your authority. Whether they will or not is another matter! 
VIRGO, Stick to concise and businesslike communications and you'll be in the clear. If, on the other hand, you stray from the straight and narrow, whatever you say will be misunderstood and misconstrued. You're beginning to take certain obstacles for granted, but they won't last long. 
LIBRA, One false move and even minor differences of opinion could well become major conflicts. Probably the best thing is to keep your principles and ideals to yourself and avoid imposing arbitrary standards on other people. After all, if you don't explain yourself, you can't expect partners to know what you want. 
SCORPIO, Gentle Venus should enable you to keep your emotions under control, yet Mars' imminent movement into a new region of your chart is storing up trouble between colleagues. Therefore, I think that you should now be aware of the need to maintain equilibrium at work. 
SAGITTARIUS, In among the potential havoc that is a feature of current planetary aspects, stands a positive relationship between Venus and Pluto, which means that you could be the recipient of an enormous amount of generosity. Just a reminder about work: you have another couple of weeks to tie up loose ends. 
CAPRICORN, Most of you should now be freed from the pressures and demands that other people have been rather unfairly placing on your time. It will be a pleasure to find that partners are now increasingly willing to take life as it comes. It is so good to know that they'll be hassling you less, supporting you more. AQUARIUS There is now one compelling reason why you must take very careful note of what other people are saying and doing, and it is because within a few days you will be confronted and challenged to play your full part. But that's when the problems begin! 
GEMINI, You're hitting a brief extravagant phase, but unnecessary losses are less likely if you set out to formalise existing arrangements and see to it that whatever is agreed, is sufficiently in tune with current circumstances, to be of lasting value. CANCER According to a number of your planetary patterns you are now under near-perfect marriage indicators. What this means is that favoured relationships may now be put on a formal basis, combining your romantic aspirations with a sense of what is real and possible. 
LEO, You may have a nagging feeling that you have let yourself down or failed in some way, or perhaps missed some golden opportunity or other. I think that such worries are exaggerated and do not reflect the real situation. It's all down to the fact you expect way too much of yourself. 
VIRGO, You may still trust intimate friends, but colleagues who have less knowledge of, or sympathy with, your goals, may now be losing faith. Don't worry about it. After all, perhaps these are people you can do without. Take the line that you are better off free of them dogging your progress. 
LIBRA, Emotional strains are such that loved ones or close companions appear to believe that you lack the skill to organise your affairs or the resolve to stand your ground. Such attitudes need not concern you. After all, you know that they're wrong - don't you? 
SCORPIO, The most prominent astrological aspects are somewhat ill-tempered, yet also favour those stable relationships which are absolutely in line with your deepest desires. Stale partnerships may have outrun their course, and you have the choice; either revive them or move on. 
SAGITTARIUS, You have the support and goodwill of a number of financially-minded planets, which should be sufficient to defend you against electrifying alignments emanating from Aquarius. In plain English, it will be your friends who protect you from financial chaos. 
CAPRICORN, Although you may balk at having to take on additional responsibilities, you must see that increases in your work-load are almost exclusively due to your own inability to say ‘no', or discriminate between different options. Make the right choices and you'll transform your affairs beyond all recognition. AQUARIUS It is beyond the power of an astrologer to specify exactly what is bothering you at the moment, or making you feel slightly uncertain about the future. What I can say is that friction over joint activities is a powerful factor. If you duck a confrontation, you may also well throw away the chance of a major opportunity. 
GEMINI, Bearing in mind that you are passing through a phase of existence that must be described as favourable, you may survive a financial crisis intact. However, you should insure yourself by taking every possible precaution. After all, a good gambler always calculates the odds well in advance. CANCER It is now time to start holding peace talks. Even if friends and colleagues are still behaving irrationally, you must make every effort to pour oil on troubled waters and distinguish fact from fantasy. And, as an added aside, don't let anyone over-charge you. 
LEO, What you need now is a bolt-hole, somewhere to hide from the attacks and criticisms that seem to be heading in your direction. One of your fears is that personal friction will disrupt your working life. Perhaps you're just a little too thin-skinned today. 
VIRGO, The strongest planet of the moment is Venus, which is currently indicating emotional turmoil. This is not an easy time for you practical Virgoans, but it is certainly easier than last week, and I suspect that you will handle partners' demands better than most people. 
LIBRA, Obstinacy doesn't suit you. It never did, and it certainly doesn't now. According to an old Chinese saying, the branch which does not bend in the wind will break. Right now, you are that branch, so it is vital that you adopt a totally pragmatic and flexible approach. 
SCORPIO, Your planetary pictures are so contradictory that it is honestly impossible to say whether this is a good moment for you to travel or not. Much depends on how you handle your personal relationships. I should think that it's time to tie up loose ends. 
SAGITTARIUS, Around this time of year, when the Sun is beginning to pass through materialistic regions of your chart, you are forced to pay more attention to other people's needs. The sense in such an approach will become clear if you consider the financial consequences of a personal rift. 
CAPRICORN, You do tend to feel over-dependent on people around you, and the determination of others to exploit your discomfort may make you feel rather uneasy about the future. Yet, if you are to be entirely truthful, you must see just how far you are responsible for the current situation. AQUARIUS Very little in astrology is subject to fate, or to circumstances we can't influence. Difficult planetary aspects are not bound to bring personal disputes to the fore, but this may be precisely the result you get unless you take the initiative and try to force everyone to co-operate. 
GEMINI, That optimistic planet Jupiter is at a crucial point in its twelve-year cycle around your horoscope, during which opportunities have come and gone. The sky is the limit as the culmination of this long-term phase approaches. I'd say it's time to broaden your horizons. CANCER Your passions are due to increase. Far from undermining you, partners' discreet actions will be calculated to further your interests. In any case, it will be a brave person who manages to take you on, and win, as long as Mars and Venus are so closely linked. 
LEO, Partners are playing a complicated game, that's for sure. You're still faced with contradictions, but may be utterly unable to clarify the issues, let alone resolve differences. Fall back on support from social contacts as a means of pursuing your goals. 
VIRGO, You've got three substantial planetary movements over the next week. Venus is soon to join Mercury and Uranus to complete a brilliant and determined trio in critical sectors of your solar chart. There really is nothing that you cannot achieve, if you set your heart on it. 
LIBRA, Yours is not usually known as an adventurous sign, even though individual Librans have often been known to take a tough stance. Now is one of those times when all of you may take several major steps forward. If you have any truly loyal friends, stick close - they're the ones who will carry you to the future. 
SCORPIO, Much has been written about your financial and business affairs over recent months. Everything that takes place now will convince you that good fortune is likely to become permanent rather than, as once you feared, be no more than a temporary blip. 
SAGITTARIUS, However much you pretend otherwise, chance words can go deep. It must now be repeated that if you step aside and allow partners to take centre stage, you may share in their good fortune. Also, decisions involving your personal affairs must be taken in the full light of day. 
CAPRICORN, The planets are indicating the possibility of a dramatic improvement in your health. Yet this will not take place without some initiative on your part, perhaps dietary, perhaps associated with complementary medicine or a new exercise regime. AQUARIUS An extraordinary line-up of pugnacious planets is exerting an influence over creative sectors of your chart, producing exactly the degree of support that you need at this time. Among the beneficiaries are people to whom you are romantically linked. 
GEMINI, Mercury's excitable behaviour is making life seem rather blurred around the edges. Most of you are having a hard time just getting a fix on what it is you're supposed to be doing, and why. Actually, this is in ideal time to question your current involvements, setting yourself free for a number of improvements. Horoscope Today, June 10, 2019: Aries, Leo, Taurus, Virgo, Gemini, Cancer, check astrology prediction CANCER The entire week will be dominated by the gradual approach of Venus and Mars to their various meetings with Jupiter, planet of hope and optimism. You must realise that this is a time when you may achieve your life-long goals, always provided you are prepared to take a giant leap of faith: you have to believe in yourself! 
LEO, The Moon gives you a flying start, but not until the middle of the week. All you need to do is make sure that your very wonderful ideas are put into practice in every detail. Inspiration is on the way for working Leos, too, especially if you have won colleagues over with your ready charm and wit. 
VIRGO, You are now caught between two utterly marvellous planetary alignments, one which encourages you to break free, the other which urges you to stay where you are. If there is a problem, it's too much choice! The planets are begging you to put your daily routine to one side and indulge yourself in your favourite fancy. Please enjoy yourself! 
LIBRA, The planets are in a muddle, but the result is that you can make your own choices. On one level this is an excellent time for all business-minded Librans. On another, you should understand that any decisions taken now are likely to be revised or regretted later on. So, when it comes to spending your hard-earned cash, be sure exactly what you want. 
SCORPIO, Be positive. The Sun is edging its way towards a slap-up confrontation with your chart, so you will have to face the music sooner or later. The best advice now is: come clean about all past blunders and convince other people you were in the right - and had no choice. And do give partners the benefit of the doubt. 
SAGITTARIUS, A financial problem should now lie in the past, which will come as quite a relief. At the very least, you can look forward to a smoother ride in the future. And, as an added bonus, you're about to receive all the credit you so richly deserve for all your past efforts and achievements. Also, be sure to listen to good advice later in the week. 
CAPRICORN, This is, in general, a fine time of year, mainly because the Sun's gentle change of position helps you come to terms with your motives and calm your shattered nerves - and get back on your feet. The best planetary patterns arouse romantic thoughts for all the young-at-heart, however old they are. I hope that includes you. AQUARIUS Home improvements are figured strongly in this week's stars, as are family meetings. The only snag is that you are finding it difficult to make up your mind about which arrangements you actually prefer. Even when you settle on a particular option you may find that matters outside your control cause delays. 
GEMINI, You can pre-empt imminent planetary movements and make an effort to form new relationships. From this weekend onwards, partnership and teamwork will be the main consideration at work and in your personal affairs. Actually, the most important people could turn out to be those you have known for a long time. CANCER If you're following precise planetary patterns, now is the time to make formal arrangements, but also to break out and abandon your commitments. Romantic illusions may be nothing more than harmless fun. In other words, the possibilities are various, the options many. 
LEO, This is a superb day for local jaunts or country trips. You should now be free of the pressures that have made travel such a risky business over the past few days. You may afford to be more confident in personal matters, perhaps because other people are now more open to your brand of doing things. 
VIRGO, Although you would still be advised against any temptation to indulge in speculation, you may now begin to plan sensible domestic spending. Those of you involved in property deals may look forward to better conditions some way down the line - perhaps sooner than you think. 
LIBRA, The Sun and Mars, those two ambitious and energetic planets, are still your faithful allies. Aim as high as you wish now, because until you try, there is no knowing what can be achieved. The first step is to gather information, so that you find out what other people are up to. 
SCORPIO, The reason why partners or close associates have been so off-hand and un-co-operative is still far from clear. However, in the financial area you will now find it much easier to reach some sort of consensus. You'll be keeping your plans to yourself for a while, so watch your tongue. 
SAGITTARIUS, Because the planets are constantly on the move, no one situation ever lasts for too long. The planetary configuration is now improving, and you will be the first to feel the refreshing winds of change. Social and team enterprises benefit first. 
CAPRICORN, Neither adverse planetary aspects nor your sober Capricornian nature should be allowed to dampen the current enthusiasm for life. However, in some way, professional concerns are likely to intrude on the weekend. They may concern partners or relations, but you'll still have your say. AQUARIUS Now that goodwill is returning, you may receive appreciation for your worthwhile efforts on other people's behalf. You may, if you wish, announce to the world your intentions for the future. You seem to be prepared to make the most of yourself for once. 
GEMINI, By all means allow colleagues or close partners to air their feelings, but there is no reason why you should take responsibility for their grievances or complaints. You are not to blame, so don't imagine that you are. But what you can do is try to explain yourself better in the future. CANCER Your famous maternal qualities may be in much demand now that the dust is settling and partners are licking their wounds. On the other hand, you have cares of your own to deal with. I have a feeling that people around you will instinctively look to you to take responsibility for them. Read | Sadhvi Pragya too unwell to be in trial court, but she is well enough to be here 
LEO, Pride is a strength if it is the source of your self-confidence, but humility is a virtue to be encouraged if it enables you to form a deeper bond with a particular person. At any rate, it's a time to sit down and talk, especially to people you live with. 
VIRGO, There may be much to be said for going over old ground, even if it does mean repeating yourself or letting yourself in for situations which may be frankly quite dull. Yet, as the old cliche says, a stitch in time saves nine. You still have some finely-judged financial decisions to make, so keep your concentration. 
LIBRA, The past week or so must have been challenging and emotionally trying, yet now that the planets responsible for causing such strain are drifting apart you may move quickly to restore goodwill. Actually, you're in a much better position than you might imagine. 
SCORPIO, The Sun is shedding new light on aspects of your character you never dreamed existed. Little by little, fresh information is coming your way - and may cause you to alter some of your most cherished opinions. The result? You'll soon be changing some of your secret plans.

SAGITTARIUS, You are now entering a much more sociable phase and will soon be back to your normal self. Try to re-establish control over your spending, and get all your finances in proper order. You're in a tough position, but I am sure that you will be able to come out on top. 
CAPRICORN, You must now feel that your status and prestige are soaring upwards, yet there may be a price to pay. For a start you must see to it that partners are kept happy and that you fulfill all your commitments. Stay one step ahead of the game and focus on domestic and family affairs. AQUARIUS Seldom have you experienced a stranger period in relation to your dreams or deepest yearnings. This is one of those times when you will see the value of being in tune with your inner self, not the easiest of tasks in this busy world. A word about love affairs - your hopes may be too high. How about being more realistic? 
GEMINI, Try to reach out and see how other people are feeling. What's needed is not only sympathy but empathy - the ability to tune into other people's emotions with compassion and understanding. Your romantic stars are pretty strong, by the way, so proceed with confidence. CANCER Because Mars is still in such a difficult alignment with a number of planets, people are prepared to fight their corner to the bitter end. Yet what they are defending is nothing but an illusion. Still, if it means something to them, then that's their prerogative. 
LEO, Meetings are liable to be stormy, so if important issues are at stake you may feel it is best to wait until later for a final verdict. Above all, there is nothing to be gained from forcing the pace. Let events unfold in their own good time and I think you'll be pleased with the results. 
VIRGO, You're in a strong position. Yet you may be unable to resist being embroiled in a series of strange and often unhelpful situations. Maintain your sense of humour and keep smiling throughout! A professional opportunity comes your way as a result of a colleague's goodwill. 
LIBRA, Even if one particular venture or involvement falls apart at the seams, you must realise that in the astrological universe everything is for the best. Be ready to let go of the past for, if your planetary alignments mean anything, it's that you're ready to start building a bright future. 
SCORPIO, So much depends on your ability to press ahead without co-operation. You are used to being thrown back on your own resources and you are well able to deal with anything that life may throw at you. You will soon see the upside of something which recently seemed so difficult. 
SAGITTARIUS, An emotional tie or attachment may now be viewed in a completely different light, yet the way you see things now may have no more real validity than did your former opinions. All are but different faces of the same wonderful, multi-faceted picture. 
CAPRICORN, Challenging aspects to your special planets are not making it easy for you to keep existing enterprises going, let alone get long-term projects off the ground. Why not stop struggling and take some time off? I say that partly because you have so much to learn from mixing with new friends. AQUARIUS Forget about conventional answers to current dilemmas, whether your concerns are of a professional or a personal nature. Now it is time to implement the radical solutions which are your particular stock-in-trade. Just because other people are tied to convention, that doesn't mean that you should be as well. 
GEMINI, Creative speculation of all kinds is on the agenda. You may consider this advice inappropriate, but the stars are urging you to act in an utterly irresponsible manner. Yet the wise Geminian will keep disruption to a minimum, pouring oil on troubled waters. CANCER The planets are pushing you towards a path which is utterly carefree. Ideally, life should consist of one huge, endless party. However, the downside of current trends is an uncommon tendency to take offence. Why don't you stop being so sensitive and give partners the benefit of the doubt? 
LEO, There is a wild nature to your sign, which is why today's exceptionally excitable planetary picture suits you down to the ground. The risk is that you will say or hear things which are unpleasant if not downright offensive. Be wise and hold your tongue. 
VIRGO, By all means take a gamble, place your savings on a race or some other unlikely investment, but don't expect to win! Clever Virgos will now live up to their sign's prudent nature. An added bonus is that the whole of the next month brings the chance of financial favours. 
LIBRA, Your family hopes and domestic dreams must take precedence over anything else. Focus on the larger picture and leave the practical details to trustworthy and experienced helpers. Why shouldn't partners do their fair share? After all, you have more important fish to fry. 
SCORPIO, Don't get involved in any back-stabbing or skulduggery, however justified you think you are. People who have done you down will eventually receive their just desserts without any intervention from you. They'll see the error of their ways, you can be sure of that. 
SAGITTARIUS, You will be keen to bring into the open ideas, beliefs and actions which have been taking place behind closed doors. However, you must take pains to be scrupulously fair to all concerned. It's a question of weighing all the pros and cons, and coming to a rational conclusion. 
CAPRICORN, You must make a conscious effort to maintain an atmosphere of good humour and toleration. This is especially the case at work - or in any public activities in which people are acutely aware of any infringement of their rights. Do try to see other people's points of view. AQUARIUS For the whole week you must take great care with all travel arrangements. A planetary tendency towards confusion and muddle may be countered by a determination to check all directions and instructions. The real problem lies in your impatience and tendency to overlook details - so slow down! 
GEMINI, You will be caught in the same unrealistic fantasies which affect so many people in your circle. This is no time for your famous clarity of thought, except in so far as you have minor domestic arrangements to complete. Let your imagination roam free, like a genie out of a bottle. READ | 3-language policy: National Education Policy draft revised, 2 members object CANCER You are usually a shrewd judge of character, yet your normal good sense has temporarily abandoned you. You are likely to judge other people by romantic criteria which have nothing to do with them and everything to do with your unfulfilled expectations. 
LEO, You're free to make your own decisions - and don't forget it! Most of what happens will not influence you on a deeply personal level. Instead it will be external matters - work, savings and so on - which seem to be important. Plus, of course, you have a great deal more in the way of social skills than usual. 
VIRGO, You may feel safe with Mercury once again in a secure location, meaning that you now have the strength to shape decisions, arrangements and proposals to your will. Waste no effort, for time is short - very short. The first step is to see that your finances are in order. It is just your luck to be seized with a great deal of determined and practical energy when the general planetary situation is supporting your motivation, competence and skill. You'll overcome a personal challenge with your usual brilliance. READ | Ex-Army man declared illegal: Witnesses say police faked it 
SCORPIO, You may be involved in secret or discreet discussions, yet while one part of you realises the importance of keeping the facts close to your chest, another will be urging you to blurt out everything you know. Wait a couple of days and your position should be stronger. 
SAGITTARIUS, It would be a shame if your genuine nobility of spirit were now to be sacrificed on the altar of financial success. Instead, try to see that money is a resource to be used for the general good. A change of heart on your part will transform partners' feelings about you. 
CAPRICORN, Your eyes may be bigger than your stomach at the moment, which is a colourful way of saying that your ambitions may be unrealistic considering your resources. Traditional entertainments suit your mood, so stick to old friends and familiar places - and be happy! READ | IAF transport aircraft with 13 on board lost in Arunachal Pradesh AQUARIUS Given that the overwhelming mood of the times is philanthropic, charitable, confused, visionary, impractical and muddled, see to it that you are able to distinguish gullibility and exploitation from genuine service to others. Be a door-mat no longer! 
GEMINI, Your life is by its very nature complicated, which is why interpreting your planetary picture at the moment is so difficult. The problem is that, while you are being urged to take a gamble, there is no absolute or ultimate guarantee of success. CANCER The main focus of activity must be your immediate environment, which doesn't only refer to family chores or domestic decorations and repairs: you may also be getting more involved in some sort of community action; perhaps you're coming to see the wider world as a sort of extended part of your own family. 
LEO,Daily trends are ruled mainly by the Moon's rapid motion. Today it is issued close to home which dominates your thinking. The obsessive planet Pluto will be turning your mind to what you can do to improve the situation, encouraging you to accept only the real thing; no imitations, please!

VIRGO, Spending money must now be more important than saving it. How is this? Are there perhaps items you can buy which will dramatically improve your lifestyle or enhance the quality of life? Luxury seems to be more important than a necessity, so relax a little. LIBRA The current planetary alignment is ideal for those of you who are participating in a spiritual quest, but not of much help to those who are bogged down with practical cares or snowed under with chores. A word of advice, though - try and take whatever time off you need. 
SCORPIO, Current transits highlight the higher side of life, the human quest for Truth. The ideal way to express your planetary patterns for the next few days is to willingly sacrifice your interests in the service of those who are genuinely in need of sympathy and support.

SAGITTARIUS, The current celestial picture is highly expansive. As far as you are concerned this might mean that your investments or savings may yield a greater than expected return, but also that, over the next month, your spending may spiral out of control. 
CAPRICORN, If worldly ambitions seem to be meeting practical problems, don't kick against fate. Instead, switch your attention to long-term plans: if you could wish for anything in the world, what would it be? World peace, perhaps? Or at least an end to a confrontation in your own life. AQUARIUS It is your inner world of dreams and beliefs that are most important at the moment. Unfortunately, if you are primarily concerned with daily trivia, the subtleties of the present time may pass you by. Raise your sights as high as you can and look at the bigger picture. 
GEMINI, Mysterious conditions continue through the first part of the month. You may therefore still feel a little uncertain about partners' motives or intentions. However, there is potentially so much happening socially that you can escape personal complications by throwing yourself into group activities. CANCER Mercury, the planet of communication, is bringing a gradual but pronounced shift in your ideas. However, much as you may want to get things off your chest, you seem to be under some sort of pressure to keep certain facts to yourself. Is there some embarrassment, perhaps connected to a friend or family member? 
LEO, There could be no escape from the fact that this is a rather argumentative week. However, you may consciously channel stressful planetary energies towards constructive dialogue. Friends, partners and family members will thank you if you play the peacemaker. But it may also be useful if you allow them to clear the air. 
VIRGO, The week opens on a rather busy note, but within a few days the focus will shift towards more personal matters. You'll be relieved to see that close associates really do share some of your aims. It will therefore be easier than you think to achieve your personal goals. And that has to be welcome news. LIBRA Money stars rise up your celestial agenda, so keep a close eye on your finances and don't do anything rash. Wonderful bargains may turn out to be anything but good buys, while even sound investments may go wrong. As you can see, this is a week to play safe, not to speculate. Expect weird and wonderful social invitations. 
SCORPIO, It's time to face up to your responsibilities, both personal and public. This may require one or two unpopular actions but, as a true Scorpio, nothing can daunt you. Partners who have stepped out of line need putting back in their place. You're still bound to face a few delays at work but, then, that's life, as they say! 
SAGITTARIUS, You may still be recovering from recent lunar storms, with all their attendant excitement. This may therefore be an ideal time to restore confidence, mend fences, tie up loose ends and generally take charge. Friends and colleagues will be offering invaluable advice, so sit up and listen - for once! 
CAPRICORN, Press ahead with repairs, decorations and improvements at home, but bear in mind that unusual problems require radical solutions. You may therefore have to break the habits of a lifetime. Family members may have their own ideas, though. Please be diplomatic, say the right thing, and they'll respect you all the more. AQUARIUS Mercury, the planet of dreams and ideas, is bound to be a pleasant influence over the next few weeks, rousing creative impulses and endowing you with a feeling that you can indeed enjoy life on your own terms. It's time to make plans for the future. Younger family members need your help and sympathy. 
GEMINI, Jupiter's celestial patterns are truly delightful and, by rights, you ought to be celebrating your good fortune. However, those of you who are blind to your benefits and advantages may let a marvellous opportunity slip through your fingers. It's all a question of keeping a clear head. CANCER You should continue to take extra care when travelling and allow for delays. Lunar alignments are raising the prospect of mistakes and misunderstandings and advising you to check the small print. You are bound to feel you're doing more than your fair share, so try to get partners to take over. 
LEO,Mercury's witty wanderings in your chart are maintained for a little while longer, and helping you to stay one step ahead of the field in terms of your ideas and proposals. However, I don't think you can escape today's general undercurrent of unreason. 
VIRGO, Certainty alternates with uncertainty, and what takes place over the next few days will shake up your ideas. You may also be able to make up lost ground. Social engagement may be affected by what can only be described as mysterious or inexplicable developments. LIBRA Recent events may have made you aware that certain commitments and obligations must change. You may already have decided that specific promises should never have been made. Perhaps items of personal property may have to be off-loaded. And perhaps for good! 
SCORPIO, Everything should be moving this weekend. For one thing, it looks as if a foreign connection or travel arrangement should be completed, finalised or terminated. For another, you'; re-entering a new professional phase. At least you'll know what you must do next! 
SAGITTARIUS, Mars'; impact on the work and professional angle of your solar chart is bound to keep you busy. However, don't stick to your normal routine. Make a break with tradition and you'll discover just how easy life can be. And take pleasure from the fact that ambition is now attainable. 
CAPRICORN, Hopefully, you will keep yourself in check at this turbulent time. Normally in such circumstances, I'd advise you to make sure that your head rules your heart, but the situation now seems too complex for such simple advice. You see, your heart looks to the future while your head longs for the past! AQUARIUS Partners and friends certainly seem to be in a stroppy mood. There is no reason, though, why this shouldn't be one of the most rewarding and exciting periods you have ever experienced. But think about this - are they dissatisfied because you have ignored their feelings? 
GEMINI, No one and nothing can prevent you from getting your way. Only your own impatience, impulsiveness and refusal to listen to reason can sabotage or undermine your credibility. In love, take your time, and persuade a partner that you are on the right track. CANCER Financial questions are being brought into perspective by Mercury'; uncompromising relationships. Hard choices are necessary and you may be forced to draw in your horns, if only briefly. At least it's now much easier to make up your mind on practical choices. 
LEO,Even a major move or upheaval on the home front will be to your advantage in the long-term, so don't flinch or fudge the issues. By the beginning of next week, you'll have a much clearer idea of where you're heading, partly because you'll have forgotten what happened last week! 
VIRGO, Don't go the whole hog over finances, at least not yet. You see, the planets are beginning to assume a very fortunate position, but just for now they are still spreading confusion. If you have a problem, it's impatience and a tendency to try to get to the finishing post before you've started! LIBRA Of course, you would like to be in a much better position - who wouldn't? But you have to understand that your Libran perfectionism makes it so hard to accept anything but the very best. Many of you have decided that your independence is worth more than an old, tired emotional tie. 
SCORPIO, On the home front, it really does seem to be a case of least said, soonest mended. Save your energy for professional ambitions and worldly achievements. Overseas romance beckons for travelling Scorpios, but you could be swept away by a place as much as a person. 
SAGITTARIUS, I have written a great deal about your monetary situation in recent times, and as you know only too well, you are over-committed financially. There may be much to be said for borrowing a little extra, just as long as no strings are involved. 
CAPRICORN, Although you should now be on much firmer ground when contesting controversial actions and statements, there seems to be little chance of getting other people to see things your way. Unless that is, you bend the rules and fudge the issues. And I am sure you can do it! AQUARIUS Mercury's current aspects are bright and witty. You must choose your words and timing with the utmost care and on no account offend or alienate people with whom you must remain friends. It's all a matter of discovering your secret, diplomatic skills. 
GEMINI, Wait a while before broaching controversial subjects. Other people may not be ready to hear what you have to say. The fact that you are ahead of the field gives you a certain amount of leeway. In any event, your lunar alignments are supportive, so you can afford a breather. CANCER If you have been despairing of someone else and finally ceasing to hope that emotional plans will ever work out, then cheer up: Venus'; new role in your chart is bound to bring all the love you can handle, not to mention new friends and a fresh social scene. 
LEO,I don't think you will regret having made certain compromises or concessions. By being flexible and open to suggestions you will help ease a log-jam that was creating problems for many people. And, in freeing a blockage in your own life, you'll ease difficulties for others. 
VIRGO, Personal events over the past few months have forced you to be more forthright and open, but you may still feel that one or two pieces of information need to be kept under wraps for now. You must - and will - seize the initiative, but you have to carry partners with you. LIBRA Venus, your charming planetary ruler, is now hovering on the edge of a sensitive region of your chart. You will shortly find that it is pure feeling and romantic aspirations that dominate your daily affairs. Suspicion is also about to be laid to rest. 
SCORPIO, There are very sound astrological reasons why you should keep your own counsel and not get too bound up in what other people imagine is the right thing to do. You see, what may be fine for them could be utterly wrong for you. You may be out of sync with a partner, but it won't last long. 
SAGITTARIUS, For most of you everything will become less of a strain after the weekend, so why not go along with busy, challenging trends instead of resisting them? You may expect news from afar before long, and it could be this which finally determines you to take a new path. 
CAPRICORN, Even a challenging planetary alignment can't put you off your pursuit of certain personal aims and ambitions. I have a feeling in my bones that what is said over the next few days may make up for past disappointments. And that just has to be good news. AQUARIUS Aquarius is a fixed sign, which means that although you appear to be ever so adaptable, in fact, you tend to panic when faced with change that is not of your making. Be a little more flexible now, and you'll open the way to an invitation you always dreamt of. 
GEMINI, Loved ones could have problems they simply cannot discuss, so you may have to understand that someone must be left in peace. It would be worth your while seeking the company of people who support your ideas. You see, someone, somewhere, has the advice you need, but you won't know who unless you search them out. CANCER You should not be at all surprised if loved ones are acting out of character. The fact is that many people just don't know what they want and it's quite natural that they should lead you a merry old dance. Mind you, I am quite sure that you can give as good as you get. 
LEO,It looks as though one particular arrangement may have to be terminated before very much longer. As yet, you may not be sure what is going on. Indeed, it may be next week before you have all the answers. All you need to know now is that partners are likely to agree to one thing, one day, another, the next. 
VIRGO, You're a fan of justice and you love to do the right thing. What is said or done now may seem terribly unfair. However, please try to understand that, while the planets are inclining you to be rather self-pitying, they are also challenging you to rise above such petty feelings. LIBRA A long-standing relationship is set to receive an important boost. It seems increasingly likely that someone with prestige and status in the community will be entering your life before long. You may even receive an offer which will transform your personal affairs. 
SCORPIO, Major alterations at work are liable to result from differences of opinion. In a sense, it's not the actual situation that matters, but disagreements about what should be done next. Take your time. After all, nobody has any right to pressurise you until you're ready. 
SAGITTARIUS, I know it's an old cliche, but there is a difference between the law and justice. You may be a little too hung up on the former, whereas what is really needed is the flexibility and compassion of the latter. Perhaps that's why you're not yet ready to make up your mind. 
CAPRICORN, Current planetary activity denotes a period of intellectual curiosity. It's therefore almost inevitable that you will question a number of established assumptions. You must allow partners to have their say, otherwise, they'll harbour a grudge until next month. AQUARIUS Your wonderfully mischievous sense of humour should be well to the fore over the coming few days. It's often the most serious people, such as you, who are best able to see the funny side of things. And after all, that has happened recently, you just have to laugh. 
GEMINI, Mercury, your planetary ruler, plays a significant role in almost every important celestial aspect over the near future, even if indirectly. You may find that in one way or another, and probably without meaning to, you become the centre of attention. CANCER You are still passing through an outstanding and memorable period, although it looks very much as if you may be taking your good luck for granted. It's amazing what you can find to grumble about when you try! Financial stress seems to be ever-present but will pass soon. 
LEO,You may enhance your freedom of action by taking responsibility for your own choices. Any adverse aspects between now and the end of the week will remind you that you must exert more control over your personal affairs. Deal with problems just as soon as you see them coming. 
VIRGO, Awkward dilemmas refuse to go away! You'll be wondering whether you can adjust your own beliefs and fit in with other people's demands. But, then, should you even consider unusual offers - or just turn them down flat? You see, you might find that if you go ahead now, circumstances will have changed by the time you finish. LIBRA Stand back and take a cool look at some of your obligations. Many areas of your life must now be viewed in the cold light of day. You will have to examine details and issues that could encourage you to make long-overdue improvements in your personal affairs. 
SCORPIO, You're still wondering whether you've made a commitment too far. Although by nature you tend to give others the benefit of the doubt, this isn't because you think they're right. It's because you lack confidence in your own ideas. Be a little more determined this week. 
SAGITTARIUS, Pluto is the planet responsible for some of the positive forecasts made for you over the last year. It is still bugging you, but if you would only accept that a shake-up in your opinions and attitudes was necessary, you'd soon rid yourself of any lingering blues. 
CAPRICORN, As a Capricorn, you know how important material security is to your well-being. It's therefore welcome news that a financial matter completed this week should allay many of your current fears. If you're over-emotional early on, don't worry; by the afternoon you'll be much more level-headed. AQUARIUS You're walking a tight-rope. Make the right moves and your success will be brilliant. Even now your destiny is being shaped by a strident solar alignment which is due to stirring up the heavens before very much longer. The time has come to play for even higher stakes than in the past.
