aries,You’re not the sort to play safe and even if you have been a bit more cautious than usual in recent weeks you will more than make up for it over the next few days. Plan your new adventure today and start working on it tomorrow.
aries,There is no such thing as something for nothing and if you do not quite believe that now you will believe it by the end of the day. If you lose something valuable accept it as the price you must pay to learn this important lesson.
aries,As the new moon falls in one of the more adventurous areas of your chart you will take the kind of risk you might usually steer clear of. No doubt it will surprise a few people, including yourself, when it pays off handsomely.
aries,You will hear something amazing today but can you believe it? If it sounds too good to be true then it might be wise to check it out. Commit too soon and you could find you have signed up for something that does you no good.
aries,A friend or colleague you have not seen for a while will come back into your life today, tomorrow of over the weekend and you will be hugely pleased. This time, when you say farewell, promise to stay in touch – and mean it. ,aries,You may be a nice guy by nature but most likely you will refuse to come to the rescue of someone who is in distress today. It may seem heartless but you know it’s for the best – it’s the only way they are going to learn.
aries,Someone will give you a tough time this weekend and although you know you don’t deserve it you also know there is no point complaining. Do what they expect of you and, if at all possible, do it with a smile on your face.
aries,You will be restless this coming week, without knowing why. Get out and about by all means but don’t wander too far from home or you may have trouble getting back again. Wherever you go, stay in touch with loved ones. ,aries,You may be open and honest by nature but is letting any one and everyone know what you are thinking such a good idea? Some things are best kept to yourself, especially things that rivals and opponents may be able to make use of.
aries,You must avoid wishful thinking today. Cosmic activity in areas of your chart that deal with self-deception could lead you to make some silly mistakes. Reality is what it is – there is no need to embellish it or wish it were something different.
aries,If you have not made as much progress as you would have liked on a project of some kind don’t worry – and certainly don’t work even harder. Maybe in future you should set yourself targets you know you will be able to reach.
aries,You may think you have to tear everything down and start again from scratch but it’s really not necessary. There is precious little wrong with your life as it is and a few minor changes here and there is all that is required.
aries,A decision you made a long time ago now doesn’t seem like such a great idea but that’s too bad because you are stuck with it. Make the best of the situation and promise yourself that you won’t be so hasty in future.
aries,If someone you have to deal with on a day-to-day basis gets a bit bossy this weekend let them know you will not be pushed around. Others will only try to get away with what they think they can get away with. Make that nothing!,aries,If you are on the move over the next few days try to steer clear of people who upset you emotionally. Once you give in to negative emotions it will all start going wrong and you’ll end up miles from where you want to be.
aries,Family and financial problems can easily be resolved over the next seven days, but you must not keep putting them off. If you have to say something unpleasant the quicker you get it over with the less it will hurt – for both of you,aries,There are times when it is right to back down but this isn’t one of them. If you find yourself under attack today you must stand up and fight back. Don’t be intimidated by those who make lots of noise. It’s mainly for show.
aries,You will get exactly what you deserve today: no more and no less. If the rewards are good don’t doubt that you have earned them; and if the rewards are not so good then buck up your ideas and aim to do better next time.
aries,You may have lots of big ideas in your mind but are you ever going to get around to turning them into something useful, something that makes a difference both to yourself and to others? Talk is cheap – it’s actions that count.
aries,A clash of opposing viewpoints is likely on the work front today, and because you need to get along with both sides you must stay neutral. The best approach is to treat it all as a bit of a joke, because that’s exactly what it is.
aries,The Sun crosses the midheaven angle of your chart today, giving you the authority you have been lacking in recent weeks. Make the most of this change to win employers and other authority figures round to your way of thinking.
aries,Go out of your way to be pleasant to everyone you meet, even to those who are anything but pleasant to you. The more you smile and act as if the world is your friend the more the celestial powers that be will reward you.
aries,If you are happy with the way your career is going then don’t change a thing. If, however, you think you should be making more of your talents and moving up the ladder of success a good deal faster, do something about it – now!,aries,Something you have been working on for a long time will bear fruit today. Others may say you’ve been lucky but the fact is you have labored long and hard to get this far and deserve the good things now coming your way. ,aries,Don’t bother trying to hide your feelings today because with your ruler Mars at odds with unpredictable Uranus they are sure to reveal themselves in some way, maybe explosively. Let others know what is annoying you – and why.
aries,You are on the threshold of a spectacular breakthrough. Which only goes to show that when you focus on a goal and follow up on it consistently you CAN be a success. But don’t get too full of yourself or fate may burst your bubble.
aries,Flattery will get you everywhere today, especially when dealing with people in authority. You can easily persuade them to give you what you want – but don’t forget it works both ways: they may want something from you in return.
aries,Patch up any partnership disputes you may be having because current aspects will not only make joint endeavors fun but will make them profitable too. Why argue when you could be laughing and making lots of money together?,aries,A new moon in the career area of your chart means it is time to make a decision about your future. Don’t forget though that the moon is an emotional influence. Make sure you know all the facts and are thinking straight before you move ahead.
aries,No matter how many times you may have fallen short in the past you will measure up now. Push yourself hard this week and don’t give up hope just because you experience one or two setbacks. That breakthrough you seek is very close.
aries,Authority figures may be difficult to get along with today, but you can make things easier for yourself by refusing to get involved in disputes that serve no purpose. If you can, steer clear of people who rub you up the wrong way. ,aries,If you need to ask a favor of someone in a position of authority now is the time to speak up. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart is so good at the moment they will grant you (almost) anything and everything you desire.
aries,No matter how outrageous your ideas may seem to some people, you must trust your instincts and follow up on them. Allow your inner voice to guide you, and don’t be in the least bit surprised when it all works out perfectly.
aries,If your reputation is important to you, then be careful what you say and do this weekend because with Jupiter, planet of excess, at odds with the Sun you could go too far and turn people against you. Make an effort to always be moderate.
aries,What you gain over the coming week will more than make up for what you have lost, so be of good cheer. Sometimes something has to go out of your life before something new can come in and that seems to be the case now.
aries,Try to avoid confrontation today because almost certainly you will come off second best. If possible, go off and be by yourself for a while: You will return to the fray refreshed physically and mentally and with lots of great new ideas. ,aries,This is one of those days when you would rather be anywhere than where you are supposed to be. If you can find a legitimate way out of the situation then go for it, but if you just fail to turn up you could create a powerful enemy.
aries,You will gain more by doing less today. Either cut back on your workload or get friends and colleagues to help you out. Better still, do both and put your feet up. There’s no cosmic law that says you have to do anything at all.
aries,There are so many ambitions you want to pursue and so many goals you want to reach, but not even an Aries can do everything at once. Sit yourself down and decide what is the number one thing that needs to be done – then do it.
aries,Tell people the truth as you see it, even if it means upsetting someone you respect or endangering your standing with friends and colleagues. Even the smallest of lies must be avoided over the next seven days – unless you enjoy trouble.
aries,No matter how many times you have fallen short in the past you will succeed this week. The Sun remains in the most ambitious area of your chart until the 20th, so make the most of it – show the world what a star you really are.
aries,Take time out of your busy schedule to sit down and think about what it is you are doing and where it is you are going. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Are you doing what you dreamed you’d be doing?,aries,The full moon’s influence will pull your emotions first one way then the other over the next 48 hours. Because of that the safest course of action by far is to ignore them completely and act only on what your head tells you.
aries,Be honest with friends and colleagues today, even if what you have to tell them is not what they want to hear. Having said which, maybe what you think is bad news is nothing of the kind – maybe from their point of view it’s good.
aries,Your mind will be moving fast today and over the weekend as you look for ways to make your ideas pay. But don’t make any major decisions until after the Sun changes signs on the 20th. Only then will the way forward be clear.
aries,A few days from now you could find yourself moving in a new direction, with new ambitions and maybe even a new set of friends. This weekend though you are advised to sit tight and spend some quality time with your loved ones.
aries,Don’t rush into anything over the next few days but be ready to act decisively when the opportunity you have been waiting for finally arrives. Also, make a point of working more closely with people who share your ideals.
aries,Whatever you happen to be working on now you will get it done quicker and better if you get other people involved. But they must be involved as equals. It may be your vision, your baby, but don’t let your ego get in the way of success.
aries,Even if you prefer to walk alone it will pay you to get more involved in group activities over the next few days. Friends and social contacts will bring you luck and make life more enjoyable, so get out there and have some fun.
aries,You may not agree with what you hear today but you must let others have their say. Free speech is worth fighting for, so if someone tries to shout down a dissenting opinion make it your business to defend their right to be different.
aries,Is what you are planning really such a good idea? Could it be that you have overestimated your abilities? Don’t worry. The planets indicate you have what it takes and once you get moving all your doubt will disappear. So get moving!,aries,There is no point being angry about what you have to leave behind. The planets are pointing you in a new direction and urging you to take that first brave step into the unknown. What are you waiting for? Aries is supposed to be adventurous!,aries,You will get a much needed rest this weekend from a problem that has been causing you sleepless nights but it won’t go away completely. A personality conflict is still a major issue and sooner or later will have to be dealt with.
aries,Get involved in something that is bigger than yourself, such as a social movement or charitable enterprise. No matter how dynamic an Aries you may be you cannot change the world alone, but you can make a difference working with others.
aries,You will find it easier to be assertive this week but that does not mean you can order people around for the fun of it. Try to work harmoniously with those who share your aims and ambitions – there are plenty of them out there in the world.
aries,Don’t get discouraged if something you attempt does not work out the way you expected it to – it is still good practice and may even take you in a profitable new direction, one you may not otherwise have thought of. You’re making progress.
aries,You may fantasize about running away and starting again from scratch some place new, but deep down you know it isn’t going to happen. Focus on making the best of where you are and what you have got — and that’s plenty.
aries,This will be a thoroughly enjoyable day and it will be more enjoyable still if you don’t waste time worrying what other people might think about what you are doing – or, more to the point, who you are doing it with!,aries,You may prefer to deal with facts and figures but there are times when you must take what you are told on trust, and this is one of them. Those you work alongside may be difficult at times but they are still very much on your side.
aries,Something you thought was going to be difficult will be easy, and something you thought was going to be easy will be difficult. Take it all in your stride. Life is not about events as such but about what you choose to make of them.
aries,The cosmos will give your confidence a boost this week and make all things seem possible. Don’t listen to those who say you should be patient and cautious. If you can think of something you should get on and do it. Make it happen.
aries,You are in a domineering mood at the moment and won’t hesitate to tell others how to do things. But anyone who tries to tell you will most likely wish they had kept quiet. They should do as you say, not as you do!,aries,You may find it hard to predict what others are going to do next, but there is no need to keep looking over your shoulder. Despite one or two minor setbacks today, the rest of the week will be much to your liking — so enjoy. ,aries,Something will happen today that takes you by surprise but if you stand back from the situation and look at it in an objective light you will see it had to occur. Chances are that a few weeks from now you will be so glad it happened.
aries,If you could have three wishes what would they be? Focus on what you desire more than anything and there is a very good chance you will get it. Your mind is a powerful tool and if you use it to make a request the universe will respond.
aries,Looking back on the past seven days, you will be feeling quietly pleased with yourself, not least for having resisted the temptation to get uptight about issues that are of no real importance. Let others rant and rage. For you the weekend is about relaxing.
aries,Just because someone else is behaving badly or playing the fool does not mean you have to follow their example. This is going to be an important week, especially for relationships, so don’t go annoying people just for the fun of it.
aries,No matter how strong your beliefs and opinions may be, what happens today and tomorrow will make you question them. That’s good. Every now and again you need to stand back and remind yourself what it’s all about and what it’s all for. ,aries,Put a name to your fears and do something about them. Everyone expects you to be happy-go-lucky and most of the time you are, but something has been worrying you beyond belief in recent weeks. It’s time to get over it.
aries,Secrecy may not come naturally to you but the less you reveal about yourself the better. You need to be a bit more mysterious, especially on the work front. Keep both colleagues and rivals at arm’s length and don’t forget that knowledge is power.
aries,Think twice before speaking your mind. Although today’s full moon takes place in your fellow Fire sign of Aries you could still get emotional and say things you later regret, so bite your tongue and keep your feelings to yourself – for now.
aries,Even if you risk hurting a loved one’s feelings you must tell them the truth about the situation they have got themselves into. Be as tactful as you can but make sure they can see they need to change their ways – and fast.
aries,Once the Sun changes signs tomorrow you will be less concerned about what’s taking place in the world at large and more concerned about what’s going on inside your head. It’s good to think and you’ll be doing plenty over the next few days.
aries,Don’t agree to something just because you cannot be bothered to argue. If you take the easy way out now you will have major problems later on when loved ones and work colleagues hold you to your promises. Best not to make them in the first place.
aries,You will receive advice from all directions today, making it difficult to work out who is and who is not talking sense. Maybe you should shut yourself away for an hour or two and come to your own conclusions. Your inner voice knows best. ,aries,There are a lot of things you need to consider, things that may be of benefit to you in the not too distant future, so don’t waste your time socializing when you should be thinking. Come the weekend you’ll have earned the right to party.
aries,Even if you are the kind of Aries who loves surprises what happens today won’t necessarily meet with your approval, especially if the joke is on you. Think of all the times when you’ve been the prankster and don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself.
aries,There is no such thing as coincidence and the more certain events seem to keep happening the more suspicious you should be. Fortunately you are not as gullible as some people want to believe, so it’s unlikely you will be deceived.
aries,No matter what plans you may have made for the coming week you must set aside time to be by yourself and think about the direction your life is heading. And if you come to the conclusion that it isn’t heading anywhere then do something about it.
aries,Although you should be feeling good about yourself as the new week begins you are advised not to go over the top in any way or the consequences could be painful. Also, ask yourself some questions about the direction your life is heading.
aries,There are a number of things you need to get rid of, things that are holding you back and stopping you from realizing your full potential. You know what they are and you know they must go. Now is the time to draw a line on the past.
aries,You may be impatient to see progress being made but if you take a risk too many you could take a rather big step in the wrong direction. If you do there is no point rebuking yourself – it’s just one of those things that happens sometimes.
aries,It won’t be long before your mind is back in the groove – and your tongue will be pretty sharp as well. You will have a lot to say for yourself today but be careful that you don’t give away secrets to people who may be your rivals.
aries,As mind planet Mercury moves in your favor again today your attitude will change for the better and you will be more upbeat about your hopes and wishes. Anything is possible if you want it enough – so want it enough and be amazing!,aries,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your sky will help you see through the web of deceit that certain people have built to keep you from the truth. But don’t go to the other extreme and refuse to trust anyone about anything.
aries,You don’t need to talk yourself up – important people are well aware of what you are capable of. You won’t have to try too hard to make an impression over the next seven days. In fact you won’t have to try too hard at anything.
aries,The Sun links with power planet Pluto today, so it’s unlikely you will be in the mood to stay home and bake cookies. There is a world out there waiting to be conquered and you have both the talent and the ambition to be Number One.
aries,Not everyone shares your principles and beliefs, so don’t take it as a personal affront if others disagree with you today – which they will. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, that’s what makes the world such an interesting place.
aries,Today’s cosmic set-up is fortunate in the extreme, but only if you are prepared to get out into the world, put yourself about and shake a few hands. You know the old saying: it’s not so much what you know that matters as who you know.
aries,Family matters of one sort or another will take up most of your time today but don’t think that means you cannot have fun. On the contrary, loved ones are hoping you will suggest some kind of trip or adventure you can all enjoy together.
aries,Don’t be afraid to disagree with someone in a position of authority. You respect the fact that they outrank you but you also know that if you do as they say you will regret it. Aries is the first sign of the zodiac – so put your needs first.
aries,Stick to your principles this weekend. Don’t back off to keep the peace or for the sake of an easy life. The planets warn if you compromise on one thing your rivals will see it as a sign of weakness and pressure you into further concessions.
aries,You have a wonderful future but the Sun in your next door neighbor sign of Pisces is making you fear the worst, and that’s not good. Keep telling yourself that you deserve the best and that the best will happen – and very soon it will.
aries,The planets are encouraging you to break out of a rut and live closer to the edge for a while. Security is all very well but an Aries needs excitement too, so do something out of the ordinary this week, something that gets you noticed.
aries,A relationship that has been okay in the past will turn difficult today. There may be no apparent reason why it has suddenly gone sour but don’t make an issue of it. Most likely it is just a passing phase, so stay calm and keep smiling.
aries,The Sun in Pisces at this time of year can make you rather emotional and you will certainly find it hard to hide your feelings today. But why would you want to? Honesty is essential in all situations, especially where loved ones are concerned.
aries,The future is not bleak, no matter what some pessimists say. In fact it is exceedingly bright and you are in the right place at the right time to take advantage of all the good things that will be coming. Keep your eyes and ears open.
aries,Because Mars, your ruler, is on good form today something will happen that has you jumping for joy. By all means make plans for your professional future but leave yourself some wiggle room in case you want to change your mind later.
aries,Don’t give others the impression that you agree with them when, if anything, you think they are completely and utterly wrong. The full moon means it’s best if they know right from the start what you really think and feel.
aries,Don’t worry if you have not been getting the support and encouragement you need from partners and loved ones and work colleagues. Once the Sun moves into your birth sign on Thursday you won’t require anyone’s help but your own.
aries,The more you dwell on a matter that troubles you the more you will worry about it, so pull your mind away from the issue and focus on what makes you feel good. There are still no end of things you have to be thankful for.
aries,Put your heart and soul into what you are working on. No matter how much natural talent you may have and no matter how good you may be in a technical sense what makes you stand out from the crowd is your enthusiasm.
aries,If you make a wish over the next two or three days it may well come true. With the Sun moving into your birth sign tomorrow, marking the start of a new solar year, you are likely to get whatever you ask for – well, mostly.
aries,The Sun moves into your sign today, so there can be no more excuses. You know what you want, you know how to get it and you know that if you make a genuine effort nothing can stop you. The world is yours to command and enjoy.
aries,Don’t waste time on regrets or remorse. Don’t look back when you should be looking forward. This is your time of year and if you are positive and dynamic you will enjoy the kind of progress that makes yesterday’s doubts and failures irrelevant.
aries,You will be in a thoughtful frame of mind this weekend and that’s good. Try to resist the temptation to look for easy solutions to what are really quite complex problems. Most complex of all, of course, are other people’s emotions.
aries,If your life is in a bit of a rut at the moment the best way to cheer yourself up is to get dreaming. Jupiter makes it easy for you to conjure up all sorts of mental pictures of what your future could be like – and they’re all fabulous!,aries,If you need assistance over the next few days you must ask for it. There is nothing heroic about keeping your pain to yourself. By all means be independent but why suffer when friends and family are ready and willing to help you?,aries,When was the last time you set yourself new targets? Most likely you’ve been happy to drift along and take things as they come but now you need to be more demanding of yourself. What would you do if you knew success was guaranteed? So do it.
aries,If you are as smart as you think you are you will pay attention to what loved ones and friends say you should be doing. They can see what you cannot: that you could and should be using the talents you were born with to make the world a better place.
aries,Hopefully you will see solutions today where before you saw only problems. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters and business issues that involve other people. Together you can make a profit and have fun.
aries,You will make your presence felt today, especially on the work front where power planet Pluto encourages you to believe you are worthy of bigger and better things. You are entitled to be treated with respect – and you will make sure you get it.
aries,Love planet Venus is strong on your birthday, so affairs of the heart will be even more important than usual this year. But don’t think it’s just about romance and having fun – if you commit to a relationship it helps if you are on the same intellectual wavelength too.
aries,A new moon on your birthday will inspire you to cut ties that hold you back and march on confidently to a brighter and more bountiful future. Be honest with yourself about who you are and what it is you want most out of life – then go out and get it. ,aries,You must not let your emotions get the better of you over the coming year. You may be tempted to cut ties that only seem to bring you pain but if you give it time you will find that things improve. Ultimately, life is only as tough as you choose to make it.
aries,The more others try to make you change your mind about something the more you must dig in your heels and refuse to be moved. You know what is right and what is wrong, so make your own decision and stick to it.
aries,You have a talent for surprising people and with the Sun linked to Uranus, planet of the unexpected, in your sign today you will go out of your way to shock. Just be careful you don’t upset those on whom your security depends.
aries,See to it that you are properly rewarded for your efforts, especially on the work front where others may try to give you less than you deserve. You don’t have to be aggressive about it but make sure you get what you are worth.
aries,You seem to be feeling a bit vulnerable but there really is no need. What happens over the next few days will lift your spirits and also remind you that, even when things do go a little bit wrong, it’s not the end of the world.
aries,You are torn between two very different ways of looking at the world. On the one hand you think human nature is basically negative but on the other you want to see an essential goodness is all living things. Choose the latter. Your choice will make it true.
aries,Push your luck this week and believe all things are possible. But bear in mind too that, while you may be doing well, not everyone is as fortunate as you, so try not to make a big show of your successes – it may cause unnecessary resentment.
aries,You are about to embark on one of the best times of the year for ideas and communication. Are you ready? Anything of a creative or artistic nature will go well for you over the next few days. Be good. No, be great.
aries,It’s not always easy to get along with other people and today’s Sun-Mars aspect will in some way or other challenge you to be more accepting. Don’t forget too that from other people’s point of view you are often the one making too much noise.
aries,If you want a straight answer to a simple question you may be disappointed – others are so evasive today. Maybe they have something to hide but more likely their thoughts are simply all over the place. Not everyone is as organized as you.
aries,Take extra care when dealing with anything of a legal nature and make sure you get promises in writing. No matter how much you may trust certain people you cannot know what mental, emotional or financial pressures they are under, so don’t take chances.
aries,The influence of Neptune, planet of deception, in your chart warns you could give away too much information about yourself. Be generous with your time and, if you can afford it, with your money too but keep your secrets to yourself.
aries,Some people may get emotional this weekend but you will remain cool, calm and collected. One particular individual could really get on your nerves but the best way to deal with them is to take yourself off some place where they cannot follow.
aries,A week from now the Sun will leave your birth sign and when it does you will have to get serious about your cash flow situation. It won’t be so painful if you accept that you are spending too much and start making savings right now.
aries,Mind planet Mercury links with Uranus, planet of genius, on your birthday this year, so there is every chance you will come up with some brilliant ideas. Don’t limit yourself to old ways of thinking – be brave and ask the questions everyone else tries to avoid.
aries,There seems to be a barrier of some kind between you and other people, no doubt caused by today’s lunar eclipse in your opposite sign. Don’t worry. The cosmic tide will turn. It won’t be long before you are back on the same wavelength.
aries,You will experience plenty of ups and downs over the coming 12 months but even the downs will have a positive side, so be happy and strive to see the good in each and every situation you encounter – and each and every person who comes into your life.
aries,The moon’s eclipse of Saturn on your birthday suggests you need to reconsider your relationship to money and possessions. Yes, of course, it’s nice to be financially secure but are you emotionally secure too? If not, what can you do to change that?,aries,You want to strike out on your own. You want to do something that you alone can take credit for. That’s fine but you will get further faster if you learn from the mistakes of those who have been there before you. Do your homework – and be brilliant!,aries,If you have got into the habit of thinking that nothing will ever go wrong again then what happens this weekend will set you straight. But there is still a large luck factor working in your favor, so don’t let events dent your confidence too much.
aries,Be careful how much you spend over the next few days because if you go over the top you are likely to regret it. The planets warn you may not be as well off as you thought you were – and there are always bills to pay.
aries,Major planets are at loggerheads as the new week begins and you too will find it hard to get along with certain people. The important thing is that you don’t take any of it too seriously, because like all such situations it will pass with time.
aries,You will be somewhat impatient today, especially on the work front where you can’t understand why some people are unable to keep up with you mentally or physically. Not everyone shares your energy or enthusiasm, so calm down and make allowances.
aries,You know what it is that you want so now it’s just about how you are going to get it. If your plans are being held back by a lack of cash what happens today and tomorrow will help – but ultimately the effort must come from you.
aries,Some things are worth worrying about and some things are not – do you know which is which? Chances are material things such as money and possessions won’t mean as much to you over the next 24 hours as they usually do, and that’s good.
aries,Try not to be too serious about life today. There’s a time to ponder the big questions but this isn’t it. The planets urge you to be practical and to focus on what is in front of you. Also, stay alert for new opportunities.
aries,A new money-making venture will excite you this weekend but before you get carried away and start thinking you are going to be rich be warned that even if you do make your fortune it may cost you in other ways. Relationships are important too.
aries,If you honestly believe that certain people are trying to get rich at your expense then you must make it clear to them that the consequences won’t be pretty. Hopefully they will see sense and give you your fair share. If not…,aries,Don’t worry if your finances have not been too healthy of late because you will find ways to replace what you have lost or spent. Mind planet Mercury will also help you get your head around ideas which at other times might confuse you.
aries,You will be quick off the mark both physically and mentally today, especially if you see a chance to make some money. Both the solar eclipse and mind planet Mercury will help you make quick decisions, then follow them up with speedy action.
aries,You have taken on a lot of new tasks in recent weeks and could probably do with some help. Others will come to your assistance and share the load if you ask them but you must make it worth their while. What’s in it for them?,aries,There will be a great many claims on your time and your energy today, so be selective in what you agree to do or you may exhaust yourself. You should know by now that it’s better to do one job really well than ten jobs poorly.
aries,What you need to remember this weekend is that you have nothing to prove, either to yourself or to other people. Make sure that what you agree to do is what you want to do and not what others have persuaded you to do.
aries,You can learn a lot over the next seven days, simply by listening to what other people have to tell you. You will also be pleasantly surprised by some of the things you discover. There is always something new to learn, even for an Aries,aries,Listen to what a friend has to tell you and be quick to act on their advice. Even if what they say is not what you were hoping to hear there is a lot of wisdom in their words, not least because they can see what you currently cannot.
aries,You will get what you desire today but you will have to pay a price for it. The planets will reward you for all the hard work you have done but they will also ask you to sacrifice something you may not want to give up.
aries,Keep your eyes and ears open today because if you don’t you could miss out on a great opportunity to have fun. With Mercury moving strongly in your favor your mind will be sharp and strong, giving you a major advantage over your rivals.
aries,You are not the kind to turn away someone who is down on their luck, but watch out you don’t get conned by a sob story today. Sadly not everyone is as honest as you, so check the facts before even thinking of parting with cash.
aries,You may think you know what motivates someone but the planets warn you have got it all wrong, and that could be dangerous. Both in your personal life and at work you are advised not to jump to conclusions today – or any day.
aries,The Sun links with Saturn this weekend and you should take that as a sign that it’s time to slow down a bit. Not even an Aries can continue at the pace you have set yourself, so ease off and get your breath back.
aries,Rivals seem to know what you are doing, even when you are not sure what you are doing yourself – which puts you at a disadvantage. Either be a bit more secretive or find ways to tap in more effectively to what’s going on around you.
aries,You have started many new things in recent weeks but you will soon have to choose which one or two projects you are going to focus on. Remember, quality always counts for more than quantity, so there’s no point trying to do it all.
aries,Today’s full moon warns that, where money and possessions are concerned, nothing is quite what it seems. For that reason alone it would be wise to think twice before signing up to anything you don’t have complete personal control over.
aries,People respond better to charm than to threats or coercion, so use the power of Venus in your sign to work your way around their defenses. You need to know when to exert pressure and when to stand back and let things happen.
aries,Someone you think you can trust may try to trick you today, so be on your guard. It’s usually when you feel most relaxed and secure that you are most likely to be cheated, so make sure you know what’s going on around you.
aries,Mars in your opposite sign makes you a bit too rough and ready for some people’s tastes, so be careful you don’t make the wrong impression, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. You CAN do nice – if you try.
aries,As the Sun moves into the most open and outgoing area of your chart this week you will have no trouble at all being sociable. Not that you had much trouble before, but as from the 21st you will be a real party animal.
aries,Confront what you fear the most and it won’t ever scare you again. Few things in life are worth getting too worked up about, so face up to what has been worrying you and see it for what it really is: an illusion you can safely ignore.
aries,Don’t worry if you find it hard to put your feelings into words – your body language will tell partners and loved ones all they need to know. And with Mars, your ruler, moving in your favor again they’ll get to know plenty!,aries,There are a lot of things you have wanted to say but held back because you did not want to upset or annoy people. Now the Sun is changing signs you have no option but to speak up. If you don’t it will be you who suffers.
aries,You will jump right in and get things done today. Your mind is working fast and your body isn’t far behind it, so do what feels right and do it magnificently. You will surprise a few people, including yourself, by what you achieve.
aries,Money issues have taken center stage for some time but now the Sun has changed signs you should be a bit more relaxed about what you own and what you earn. If your social life has suffered of late make up for it today.
aries,In some way or other you will have to make sacrifices this weekend but the universe will balance things out by rewarding you in other ways, so don’t be afraid to make changes. Life is an adventure or it is nothing.
aries,Sometimes you can be overly suspicious but this week you will go right the other way and trust just about everyone. In return, others will go out of their way to smooth your path and help you realize your most cherished ambitions.
aries,This could be and should be one of the most enjoyable times of the year but if you want it to be really special you need to be more optimistic. A lot will depend on your state of mind – as it’s your mind that creates your reality.
aries,There is no point trying to predict what will happen over the next two or three days because there are so many ways the various issues in your life can play themselves out. Just stay calm and be ready to act when big events happen.
aries,You can be as carefree as you please over the next 24 hours – no one will mind in the slightest. Not that you care what other people think but it’s nice to be in a position where you can have fun without being called irresponsible.
aries,If you find yourself losing interest in what you are doing today that’s a sure sign you are doing the wrong thing. A change of scene will help but in the long-term you may have to change your lifetime ambitions. A major turning point approaches.
aries,Relationships seem to be taking on a more aggressive edge, due to the presence of Mars in your opposite sign. Keep reminding yourself that life is not a battle and that people are not the enemy. Compromise is better than confrontation.
aries,You don’t want to let others make decisions for you this weekend but you do want them to do more of the work and relieve you of some of the strain. Fortunately Mars, your ruler, is on super form, so you’ll have no trouble giving orders!,aries,The facts may be all on your side at the moment but if you are wise you won’t shout about it too loudly. If you do you may cause some resentment and could even turn a few of your friends against you. Know when to stay quiet.
aries,By all means listen to what friends and relatives tell you but don’t think for a moment you have to follow their advice. Deep down you already know what needs to be done, so why not just pluck up the courage and get on and do it?,aries,Give your brain a rest. Focus only on things that bring a smile to your face. The way you choose to think about life will determine how enjoyable, or how difficult, it is going to be. Positive thoughts always bring positive results.
aries,Although material matters may be taking up a great deal of your time that does not mean you should focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Your task today is to balance your pursuit of success with something of a more spiritual nature.
aries,What happens today may convince you that you have allowed yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security but even if it’s true it is really no big deal. You’re smart enough and tough enough to handle whatever fate sends your way.
aries,You won’t take kindly to others telling you what to do. Anyone who thinks they can order you around is going to find that you are in no mood to sit back and take it. There should be only one person calling the shots now – and that’s you.
aries,You seem to be a bit jumpy. Why is that? Whatever the reason the planets indicate there is nothing to fear, either at home or at work, so stop fretting. Also, stop beating yourself up about things that happened in the dim and distant past.
aries,You are doing things for other people which they really should be doing for themselves. At some stage over the coming week, most likely in the run-up to the full moon on the 13th, you will have to cut back on your commitments somewhat.
aries,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart inclines you to believe that everyone is out to get you, that there are enemies lurking behind every door. Maybe there are, but more likely your imagination is playing tricks on you.
aries,Your confidence is high at the moment but today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn warns it may be only skin deep. Some kind of setback could easily send you into a tailspin over the next 24 hours, so strive to keep a sense of perspective.
aries,If you have a crush on someone then let them know. There is, of course, no guarantee that they will return your feelings but even if they do not they will be flattered by your interest. One way or the other you’ll know where you stand.
aries,You may be doing well financially but there is a danger now you will take one risk too many and undo much of the good work you have put together in recent weeks. Self-belief is a wonderful thing but too much can be self-defeating.
aries,Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so don’t get uptight if someone says something you disagree with. Stay calm, tell your side of the story and then listen to theirs – and don’t be surprised if what they say makes a lot of sense.
aries,There are two ways things can go this weekend: either you can put aside your differences with someone and work together towards a common goal or you can waste your time and energy fighting each other for no real reason. Over to you.
aries,Something you said a while back may return to haunt you over the next few days but there’s not much you can do about it. Go with the flow and accept that actions always have consequences. Next time you won’t be quite so outspoken.
aries,The Sun remains in the communications area of your chart only until the 21st, so if there are things you need to say it might be best to say them now. Avoid confusion by making sure your words are simple and to the point.
aries,You may be a bit moody today for no apparent reason. Yes, okay, certain things have not worked out the way you anticipated but it’s hardly the end of the world, so keep things in perspective and do whatever it takes to cheer yourself up.
aries,You cannot control your destiny every minute of every day, so let go and let fate take its course. Some rather unsettling things are likely to happen over the next few days, but that does not mean they will be bad for you.
aries,Everyone thinks you’re a star – so why are you being so negative about your prospects? Step outside yourself today and see how you look through other people’s eyes. You may not be perfect – who is? – but you certainly come closer than most.
aries,Money and possessions are important, of course, but don’t make too big an issue of them. Over the next few days you should concentrate more on relationships, especially your family ties. It’s who you love, not what you owe, that truly matters.
aries,You cannot carry on at your current frantic pace, not if you value your health, so slow down a bit. Even an Aries needs to take a breather once in a while and the best way to do that is to spend more time with loved ones.
aries,Others may not approve of some of the ways you choose to make your mark on the world but you don’t care in the slightest. You are determined to be true to who and what you are. You certainly won’t be afraid to try something new this week.
aries,Don’t make life hard for yourself when you don’t have to. This will be one of those weeks when, if you sit back and relax, spend quality time with friends and just generally let things happen, life will be perfect in every possible way.
aries,A relationship may have been under strain of late but don’t despair. Before this week is over you will have patched up your differences and be the best of friends again. Sometimes it takes bad times to bring back the good times.
aries,Sometimes it is best to leave things to fate and as you are under divine protection at the moment nothing and no one can hurt you. Not that anyone in their right mind would want to try it anyway – an angry Aries is a sight to behold!,aries,Don’t stand back and watch life pass you by. Aries is a cardinal sign, meaning you have more drive and ambition than most, so there can be no excuses for not getting out into the world and making things happen. Go for it!,aries,Take care of family matters today. You will not only have the desire to do something about them but partners and loved ones will for once be co-operative, so make the most of the situation and spread a little happiness.
aries,If you go on a journey this weekend it will be a lot of fun but the planets warn it could also lead you in some unforeseen directions. Don’t promise to be somewhere at a certain time unless you are certain you can make it.
aries,If something stops you in your tracks this week you should take it as a sign that you are to proceed no further. You can, of course, ignore the message and carry on but you will have no one but yourself to blame if it goes wrong.
aries,Honesty is by far the best policy, so get ready to tell a friend or loved one something you fear may turn them against you. According to the planets you will be surprised to discover they don’t really care – in the nicest possible way.
aries,If your inner voice tells you one thing but all your friends tell you the opposite you must go with your gut feeling. Not everything in life can be explained logically, so don’t be afraid to believe what others say cannot be possible.
aries,You have every reason to be confident but don’t get carried away and start believing that nothing can go wrong whatever you do. Your social life may be a lot of fun but is there something of a more serious nature you should be taking care of?,aries,Don’t worry too much about details today – focus on the bigger picture. That applies as much to your personal life as it does to your work. Don’t let friends and family pin you down to plans and timetables that stifle your creativity.
aries,You have to accept what is taking place in your life, even though you may not approve of it. There are times when even an Aries must bend with the breeze and this is one of them. Do what you have to do and do it well.
aries,Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse of your ruling planet Mars will help clear the air and make it easier for you to get your point of view across. Others may not entirely agree with you but they will respect your honesty and your passion.
aries,By all means agree to settle a disagreement between two friends but once you have delivered your verdict you are advised to stand back out of the way. Chances are that neither side will be happy and the fight will go on.
aries,Partnership issues will be important today, and money matters won’t be far behind. If nothing else you must resist the urge to splash out on expensive gifts for those you love – you may end up spending a lot more than you intended.
aries,Some people may be afraid to face the future but you are made of sterner stuff. You know that fate is what you make of it and today you are determined to make of it something grand. The future? Bring it on!,aries,Follow your instincts wherever they take you and don’t worry that you can’t yet see what your ultimate destination is going to be. You should know by now that it’s the journey that matters, so sit back and enjoy the ride.
aries,Steer clear of other people’s feuds today because if you allow yourself to get involved you will regret it over the weekend. There are rights and there are wrongs on both sides, so there is no point favoring one or the other.
aries,You seem to be torn between going all out to achieve your ambitions, on the one hand, and giving up on them altogether, on the other. Put off making a decision until after tomorrow’s full moon starts to wane next week.
aries,Something you have been working on for many months has reached the stage where you must decide whether to carry on with it or whether to call it a day. There is no middle ground – it must be one or the other.
aries,As Jupiter moves into the most dynamic area of your chart on Wednesday there is plenty you can do to further your creative potential. Try to be more light-hearted than you have been of late. The idea is to have fun.
aries,Resist the urge to make value judgments about other people. We all have different fates to follow and you cannot know what is right for someone else. The only behavior you should be concerned with this week is your own.
aries,Certain people have been difficult to deal with of late and the situation is unlikely to improve until the end of the week. The important thing is that you stay calm and don’t let negative feelings take control. Everything moves in cycles.
aries,You need to pay more attention to your work and your career over the next few weeks. Ask yourself what it is you are best at and what brings out your special creativity – then do that to the exclusion of everything else.
aries,You may be tempted to be nice to someone purely for what you think you can get out of the situation but do you have to be so mercenary? The planets urge you to put others first and to be genuinely interested in what they are doing.
aries,Even an active and ambitious Aries needs to take it easy once in a while and the planets are now urging you to relax after your recent exertions. Spend time with your family today – they would certainly like to see more of you.
aries,You may believe you are under divine protection, and maybe you are, but that is not an invitation to act recklessly. Yes, you have been a bit too defensive of late, but that does not mean you now have to take foolish risks.
aries,If someone makes you an interesting offer over the next few days don’t automatically assume there is a catch involved. The planets suggest that no matter what happens, be it good, bad or indifferent, you will always be well protected.
aries,You need to get tough with someone who has been giving you a hard time. People will respect you more if you demonstrate that you respect yourself. You don’t have to take anything from anyone, today or any other day of the week.
aries,The Sun moves into the most creative and dynamic area of your chart today, so expect to be busy. There may even be times when you move so fast you find it hard to catch your breath. No matter. You do your best work at high speed.
aries,If you listen to what other people are saying you will most likely learn something to your advantage today. The Sun in Leo means there are some pretty big opportunities coming your way, so keep your eyes and ears open – and act fast.
aries,Set yourself a new challenge. Commit yourself to a goal that others say is beyond your reach. With the Sun linked to Jupiter today there is nothing you cannot do. You will certainly take great delight in proving the doubters wrong.
aries,Your head may be full of big ideas but not every last one of them is practical, so don’t get carried away and do something silly. Tomorrow’s new moon indicates great things, but you must take your time and think things through.
aries,You will have so much energy at your disposal this weekend that you must find a positive outlet for it. Focus on creative activities and affairs of the heart and, whatever else you do, make sure you get plenty of excitement in your life.
aries,Why have you not been honest in your dealings with other people? According to the planets you have been telling loved ones and work colleagues one thing when you meant something quite different. Be careful your tactics do not rebound on you.
aries,Yes, your life is in a bit of a rut but you’re not the sort to sit there and cry about it – are you? Over the next few days you will get the chance to make some major changes, so start thinking now about what they might be.
aries,You will get more out of being sociable today than by sitting at home by yourself. In fact, someone you meet on your travels will open your mind to new ideas and new possibilities and you may never be quite the same person again.
aries,You may feel you have gone as far as you can go with a project but don’t give up on it yet. If you do you will most likely regret it next month when the omens are more favorable. Just put it on the back burner for a while.
aries,Are you any closer to reaching the targets you set yourself around the start of the year? If not, it may be time to adjust your sights a bit. Remember, targets don’t have to be set in stone – you can change them any time you wish.
aries,You are feeling a lot more positive about life now and that makes you more willing to get out into the world and rub shoulders with people who can be of benefit to you. Remember: nothing in life is so bad that a smile can’t improve it.
aries,You are sure to go overboard about someone today. It may be the start of a beautiful friendship, or it may just be a passing fancy, but either way it will be fun, so forget about the serious side of life and enjoy yourself.
aries,There will be a number of emotional issues to deal with over the next few days and there may be times when it all gets a bit much. Don’t worry. Later in the week everything will have sorted itself out and you will be smiling again.
aries,The Sun in Leo does wonders for your confidence and today you will go out of your way to show the world what a special person you are. One word of warning: a financial matter you have been neglecting still needs to be dealt with.
aries,The Sun in Leo will give you a huge boost today. Even if you are one of those rare Aries who tend to see the glass as half empty rather than half full you will be positive in everything you do over the next 24 hours.
aries,Try not to give the impression that you don’t know what is going on, because that will encourage rivals to keep you in the dark. Pretend you are on top of everything and, when all else fails, bluff your way through using lots of big words.
aries,You are in an adventurous mood and you will certainly want to explore further afield than usual today. However, Mars, your ruler, warns you should not stray into areas where you do not know your way around. Always know where the exit is!,aries,Something out of the ordinary will happen today, something you will be able to take advantage of. You have never been the sort to be modest about your achievements and a few days from now you will be singing your own praises!,aries,You are a rebel by nature and with the Sun linked to Uranus, planet of upheavals, this weekend you will do something totally outrageous. It may not do much for your reputation and it may even cost you money but you’ll have fun.
aries,Some sort of opposition is inevitable this week but you will deal with it with ease. No one has the right to tell you how to behave or how to manage your affairs and the sooner (and louder) you tell them that the sooner they will leave you alone.
aries,The planets are working in your favor at the moment, making it easy for you to make things happen. They also make it easy for you to resolve issues with partners and loved ones. Tell them how you feel – then just let it go.
aries,Get plenty of rest today because you are going to be super busy towards the end of the week. The planets will confront you with challenges that demand a strong response, so get an early night and be fit and ready to make your mark.
aries,When talking with other people today it might be wise to steer clear of emotional and controversial topics. The more certain individuals get worked up about what they believe the more you should keep your distance. It’s really not that important.
aries,On the face of it the deal you are being offered may seem generous but make sure you read the small print carefully before deciding if it is the right deal for you. The more others urge you to sign up the more suspicious you should be.
aries,It will pay you to take a closer look at how you organize your everyday affairs. You may not be able to escape all your chores and responsibilities but there are certainly ways you can make them easier to handle. Give it some thought.
aries,What occurs over the next 48 hours will convince you that so many of the things you have been worrying about are not worth the effort. Life will go on no matter what you think or say, so you might as well get out there and enjoy yourself.
aries,Some people may be difficult to get along with over the next few days but it’s no big deal so don’t make an issue of it. By the time the Sun changes signs on the 23rd you will have more important things to get excited about.
aries,The Sun in Leo gives you a head start over rivals and you must use it to pull ahead of them now and over the next few days. Think about ways you can improve on your current position. Get ahead and stay ahead.
aries,Even if you started the week determined to be on good terms with everyone you will still find it difficult, if not impossible, to get along with one particular individual. Face it, you are so far apart in so many ways that friendship is highly unlikely.
aries,Keep your ideas simple today, because the more complicated your plans get the more likely it is they will end in failure. You really don’t need to do anything out of the ordinary at the moment. Just be yourself – that’s more than enough.
aries,The Sun’s imminent move into the wellbeing area of your chart suggests you may feel a bit sluggish over the next few days. But that’s okay. It’s just your body’s way of telling you to slow down for a while. Listen to it.
aries,Do what others expect of you today, even if it means you have to put your own plans on hold for a while. Make sure friends and loved ones get all the encouragement they need. It’s inspiring to get praise from someone as go-ahead as you.
aries,The Sun may be moving out of the most positive area of your chart now but the good times won’t end – in fact they’ll keep getting better. What happens this weekend will remind you how blessed you are and how much you are loved.
aries,If the pressure of work is getting too much for you then, clearly, you are doing too much. What happens over the next few days will point out ways you can relax a bit while still getting the important things done. Don’t exhaust yourself.
aries,You would be the first to admit there have been times when you worked far too hard. Now your priority must be to respect your limits and, where possible, get some rest so you can rebuild your strength. Slow down as from today.
aries,You are under a lot of pressure at the moment but that’s no bad thing. You tend to do your best work when the heat is on. If there is one thing you enjoy it is a challenge that pushes you to the limits of your ability.
aries,If you feel trapped by your current situation you must find ways to cut yourself free. You are always impatient of restrictions and won’t let other people’s plans for you hold you back. You have your own plans and intend to follow them.
aries,You will get riled up about something today. There is nothing you hate more than injustice and you will go out of your way to expose it and oppose it. Someone with an outsize ego needs to be cut down to size.
aries,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that affects joint finances warns you not to take chances with money. The more others tell you it’s okay to take a risk or two the more determined you should be to keep your cash in your pocket.
aries,If you do a good deed for someone in need this week it will come back to you many times over in the near future. Not only that but you will actually get a kick out of helping other people. Being nice can be its own reward.
aries,Let other people make decisions for you. The planets indicate this is one of those wonderful days when you don’t need to make much of an effort at all – just sit back and let the good things in life come to you.
aries,This is an excellent day for getting things done but be quick because the rest of the week will be taken up by relationship issues that eat into your time. Looking long-term, if you fancy a vacation don’t just think about it – do it.
aries,You need to pace yourself a bit over the next few days. In recent weeks you have thrown yourself into life like there was no tomorrow but not even an Aries can keep going indefinitely, so slow down and get your world back into balance.
aries,Whatever your aims and ambitions are right now they will change dramatically over the next few days. In fact, what happens today or tomorrow will in some way or other turn your plans on their head, so be ready for anything.
aries,Don’t concern yourself too much with details this weekend – life is too short to worry about what may or may not happen tomorrow. Besides, why should you exert yourself when it seems all your important needs have been taken care of?,aries,Sometimes a negative event can have a positive outcome and that seems to be what is occurring right now. Don’t worry too much about what goes out of your life over the next 48 hours – because something infinitely better will come in.
aries,Complete routine duties as quickly as you can this week because there are far more interesting things to spend your time and energy on. Others may say you are letting things slide but life is what you make of it – so make it fun.
aries,No one person is to blame for the predicament you are in, it’s just one of those things – so don’t start looking around for people to criticize. Besides, the problem can easily be solved – all you have to do is think logically and act fast.
aries,Find something constructive to do today, something that takes your mind off events that are best avoided. The full moon makes disputes and arguments easy to come by but they won’t do you any good, so find ways to stay out of trouble!,aries,You may prefer to avoid an unpleasant or embarrassing situation rather than face it head-on but deep down you know you are merely postponing the inevitable. Promise yourself you will deal with it today – and it won’t bother you again.
aries,Work and relationship issues may have placed a strain on your nerves in recent weeks but now you can see a way past your problems. A difficult phase is almost over – learn what you can from it and move on with no regrets.
aries,If you need to ask someone a favor, especially a financial favor, do so now while they are in a generous mood. When it comes to creative endeavors don’t sell yourself short – let everyone know they have a genius as a friend!,aries,As Mars moves into the most adventurous area of your chart this weekend your thoughts will turn to faraway places. Travel is very much on the cards over the next few weeks – all you need to decide is where, when and with whom.
aries,You must finish what you started over the next few days. According to the planets it is not the right time to start something new but it is the right time to complete a project that has been a bit-stop-start of late. Get busy.
aries,The final piece of a puzzle you have been struggling with will fall into place over the next two or three days. Once you can see the entire picture you will know why it took so long to make sense of it. You’ll enjoy the view too.
aries,You may be convinced that a certain course of action is correct but the strength of someone’s opposition will make you wonder if you have really got it right. Maybe you should give it a bit more thought. After all, what’s the rush?,aries,Your ideas may be amazing but unless you find practical ways of applying them to your everyday affairs they won’t do you much good. All you need is one simple idea that can be consistently applied – then you’ll find fame and fortune.
aries,Don’t compromise your principles today. You may think that others will admire you for your pragmatic approach, and maybe they will, but your rivals will see it as a sign of weakness. You must always stand up for what you believe in.
aries,A relationship may be going through a rough patch but the planets indicate there is nothing to worry about. Even so, you could still make things easier for yourself by not giving them the impression you don’t care, when you really do.
aries,Be fair and compassionate but don’t give others the impression that they can do as they please. The planets indicate that someone will try to make a drama out of what is really just a minor setback – but only if you let them.
aries,You may want to protect a friend from the consequences of their actions but deep down you know that’s not right. The only way they are going to learn from their mistakes is if they are on the receiving end for a change. Let it happen.
aries,If you believe from the start that something is going to go wrong then you increase the chances of failure ten-fold. Whatever you are involved with this coming week, keep telling yourself that you know it is going to succeed – and it will.
aries,If a romantic relationship is becoming a bit of a habit, the Sun in your opposite sign of Libra as from today will help you recover some of the sparkle that has been lost. Where true love is concerned it is never too late to start again.
aries,The new moon in your opposite sign of Libra means you cannot expect other people to automatically follow your lead. Believe it or not they have minds of their own and it looks like they intend to make use of them today.
aries,Uranus in your sign can at times makes you feel a bit tense but today’s link to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will chill you out no end. Partners and loved ones will see the difference in your attitude, and respond in kind.
aries,You seem to have overdone it recently and now need time to recover from your exertions. Even so, Aries is never inactive for long and come the beginning of next week you will be on the go again. Where to? Almost anywhere!,aries,Long-term money matters should be easier to deal with now that Mercury is moving into the wealth area of your chart. If your instincts tell you that someone is trying to cheat you don’t ignore them. The only financial advisor you need is yourself.
aries,The choices you make about a relationship will have to be lived with for months, maybe years, so think carefully before making your move. Remember, too, that although you may be tough you do sometimes need a shoulder to cry on.
aries,No matter how hard it may be to master a new technique you will do so eventually, so keep at it and don’t give up. At some point over the next two or three days you will find it suddenly, and marvelously, comes easy to you.
aries,You must honor your side of some sort of bargain. If you don’t your reputation will head south faster than you thought possible. But, of course, it works both ways – you can demand that others live up to their obligations as well.
aries,No one doubts your dedication but are you dedicated to the right goals? The planets warn you should not aim at a particular target just because you think it is expected of you. Be true to your Aries nature: ignore the status quo.
aries,A relationship needs sorting out immediately. The planets urge you to be totally honest about your emotions, even if you fear it may hurt someone’s feelings. How they react will in fact tell you a lot about your long-term prospects.
aries,You will come up against an obstacle this weekend that will take a little more time and patience to get around. Life has been good to you recently but you still have to fight to get certain things done and this is a reminder of that fact.
aries,You will have important duties and responsibilities to deal with over the next few days but if you approach them in a light-hearted manner they will actually be a lot of fun. Life does not have to be sad or serious all the time.
aries,It may be hard to figure out why a loved one is behaving badly but there is a reason and you should look for it. On the work front you are advised to take what others say as the opposite to what they actually mean.
aries,Leave your cares, worries and responsibilities behind and do something that truly inspires you. It does not matter what it is so long as you enjoy it, and that applies as much to your personal life as it does to your work. Take a break from routine.
aries,You are well on the way to achieving something that only a short while ago appeared to be out of reach, but you are not quite there yet. Today’s eclipse in your opposite sign means you have one last hurdle to overcome and one last doubter to convince.
aries,Face up to emotional problems. Don’t try to sweep them under the carpet. There is a time and a place for everything and this is the time and the place to make your feelings known. Be honest with others and tell them to be honest with you.
aries,What seemed such a sensible idea yesterday may now appear a little silly but don’t give up on it. In there somewhere is the germ of a really good plan and it can be made to work if you refuse to be disheartened – and keep thinking.
aries,You don’t have to co-operate with people if you don’t want to but it’s unlikely you will get far on your own. On a personal level, try to understand that blame rarely rests all on one side or the other. Find a middle ground you can agree on.
aries,You need to find the right combination of inspiration and perspiration over the next seven days. Make sure too that your efforts, especially on the work front, are for a reason, not just because you are doing what others expect of you. ,aries,You know from long experience that you should always listen to your inner voice. And what that voice is telling you today is that some kind of relationship problem is not as bad as you think it is. Give it time and it will heal.
aries,Some people will seem more demanding than usual over the next 24 hours, both in your personal life and at work, but that’s okay. You are both willing and able to respond to their needs and that will do your reputation no harm at all.
aries,You need to be flexible if you are to make the most of what the next few days have to offer. As for the next 24 hours: what appears serious will have a fun side and what seems like a joke could have far-reaching consequences.
aries,You trust your own judgment, of course, but can you trust the judgment of people who in your eyes have yet to prove themselves? You may have no choice in the matter today as the planets suggest that your fate is in their hands.
aries,The mood you start the day with is the mood that will remain with you until the start of next week, so find something to cheer you up and get you smiling. No matter what the doomsayers may claim the world is still a fantastic place.
aries,It’s time to resolve outstanding financial issues and put yourself on a more stable footing where money matters are concerned. You don’t have to make huge sacrifices but you do have to  make sure you know what is owed and what is due. ,aries,A friend will offer you some good advice today and if you are sensible you will act on it. The solution may be painful in the short-term but if you leave a business or financial issue unresolved it could be hugely costly in the long-term.
aries,Don’t spend forever trying to work out the best way to tackle a difficult situation, just do what feels right at this moment and throw yourself into it. Trust that fate will guide you in the right direction – and your trust will be rewarded.
aries,You are being far too negative about the future. What happens over the next two or three days will encourage you to believe that in all areas of your life what you have to look forward to far outweighs what you have to fear.
aries,The planets warn that someone you meet on your travels today is trying to hide something from you, something you need to be aware of. Dig a little deeper than usual and find out what they are up to. You can still easily outwit them.
aries,Let relationship issues take care of themselves today and over the weekend. You have spent too much time in recent weeks worrying about how others are coping with their emotional upsets when it is your own needs which need attention.
aries,According to the planets you are about to achieve the breakthrough you have been dreaming of. As Mars moves into the career area of your chart on Sunday you will rediscover the ambition and sense of purpose you appear to have lost.
aries,You may not be able to make much sense of what happens over the next few days but that does not mean there is not a solution. Perhaps you are trying too hard or maybe you are looking in the wrong direction. Try shifting your perspective slightly. ,aries,You are in two minds what you should be doing. One half of you wants to be sociable but the other half wants to shun the limelight. Why not do both? Dedicate the daylight hours to meeting people and the nighttime hours to enjoying some solitude.
aries,You will know without understanding how you know when others are lying today. No matter how persuasive certain individuals may be you would be a fool not to act on your instincts when the mental and emotional alarm bells start to ring.
aries,No matter how hard and fast you work today you won’t be able to get on top of your schedule, so just tackle what needs to be done at your own speed and don’t worry about the timing or the end product. You’ll get there eventually.
aries,If nothing seems to add up today it’s not because you are stupid but because you are trying to solve a problem that simply has no answer. It’s okay to admit it – you don’t have to be in control of each and every situation.
aries,You would benefit from a slower, more thoughtful approach to life over the next 48 hours. Time spent thinking now will be highly productive in the long-term, even though certain people may think you are being uncharacteristically lazy.
aries,Don’t let negative thinking get the better of you as the new week begins. Focus on what you are good at and trust in the planets to guide you in the right direction. Today’s Sun-Pluto link urges you to be extraordinary. ,aries,Something that seemed so simple a few days ago now looks remarkably complicated. Maybe it is, or maybe it’s just your mind cooking up obstacles that are not really there, but whatever the reason don’t make any hasty decisions today. ,aries,Try not to be impulsive or you could end up paying out a lot more than you can afford. A “one time offer” is nothing of the sort and you must not fall for it. The safest place for your money today is in your pocket.
aries,Try not to be distracted by promises of fame and fortune today and over the weekend. No matter how ambitious an Aries you happen to be you need to devote most of your time and energy to relationships – and one special relationship in particular.
aries,What you need to realize this weekend is that some rules can safely be broken but other rules must be obeyed. If you are smart you will spend some time working out which is which. If you get it wrong it could cost you serious money.
aries,Don’t try to control each and every aspect of your life leave some things to chance. Do what feels right for you in the moment and, just as important, allow others to do what feels right for them too.
aries,You may not want to get involved in a dispute between work colleagues but you have no choice. The moment things start to get heated is the moment you must step in and calm things down. Looks like it’s your turn to be the peacemaker.
aries,Over the next few days you will find yourself in situations which demand that you take a leadership role – something you are rather good at. Don’t forget though that with authority comes responsibility. Don’t let power go to your head. ,aries,If you keep an open mind about a money matter you will see possibilities and opportunities other people are likely to overlook. Life is full of surprises and you will be happily surprised how easy it is to turn a profit today.
aries,Do what you can with what you have got and you will get what you need – that is the message of the stars for you today. Too many people expect life to come to them, but you’re far too smart to be one of them.
aries,Don’t let self-doubt creep into your mind today. If a certain course of action was right before then it is still right now. There is nothing wrong with what you are doing but your attitude could be better. Be positive – and make it happen.
aries,Keep your attention focused on what is important this weekend. If you allow your mind to wander you will waste time and energy on matters that are of little or no importance. Identify your goal, then go for it. ,aries,You may feel that a target is beyond your reach but you can get there if you are prepared to make sacrifices. Whether you choose to do so or opt for an easier objective is up to you but you must make a decision quickly.
aries,Timing is always important and never more so than now. Don’t be afraid to approach people in positions of power if you have an idea to put forward or if you would like to put yourself forward for promotion. You are guaranteed a positive response.
aries,Don’t let your passion get the better of you today. There is nothing to be gained and a great deal to be lost if you act purely on emotion. It will pay you to wait a day or two before deciding what to do about a relationship.
aries,The most important thing today is that you surround yourself with people you feel relaxed and safe with. A social invitation may look exciting but if it is outside your comfort zone you should give it a miss. It’s not really your scene.
aries,The Sun moves in your favor this weekend and there is a new moon as well, so you won’t lack for inspiration of an artistic nature. But do you possess the drive and the ambition to turn inspiration into success? Of course you do! ,aries,There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot impress. Having said which there may be, over the next seven days, a tendency to drift along and take things easy. Force yourself to be dynamic and achieve something worthwhile.
aries,Don’t be too proud to accept a gift from a friend. Not only do you need what they want to give you but accepting it will make them feel good about themselves as well. It’s a win-win situation, so why reject it? ,aries,Are you working harder for ever smaller returns? Or is that an illusion, brought about by your insistence on measuring things in material or financial terms. On a deeper, more spiritual level you are a lot better off than you were a month ago. ,aries,You may feel out of step with other people today but don’t let it worry you.. Sometimes you just have to do your own thing, in your own way, at your own speed. Maybe you’re not out of step – maybe everyone else is!,aries,You will get the chance to perform an unselfish act today and you won’t hesitate for a moment. You may not receive any obvious rewards but you will feel good about yourself. Doing things for others is always a smart move.
aries,You have been known to jump to conclusions occasionally and according to the planets you made a value judgment recently that you can now see was totally and utterly wrong. It’s no big deal, just say sorry and get on with your life.
aries,You are going places now and the Sun in Sagittarius will make sure you experience so much that is new and exciting. Don’t wait for others to suggest what you should be doing, just follow your instincts and let them guide you. You won’t be disappointed. ,aries,As your ruler Mars changes signs on Thursday maybe it would be best not to make any major decisions about friendships or finances, at least not yet. If you do have to make some kind of move though follow your instincts, not the “experts.”,aries,With your ruler Mars allied to Saturn today you possess stamina, steadfastness and a taste for success. All you have to do is decide on a target and go for it. Before the day is over you will have another triumph to your name. ,aries,You can’t solve a personal problem until you actually admit that such a problem exists. Once you have done so, however, you will discover that a solution is easy to find. Most likely it was there all the time only you did not let yourself see it. ,aries,Your emotions may fluctuate wildly today but nothing bad will come of it so long as you refuse to attach too much importance to the way you feel. Mars, your ruler, changes sighs tomorrow, which means something wonderful is on its way.
aries,Try to stay calm when dealing with relationship and family problems. You may have every right to get angry but what will it solve? According to the planets everything will come right in the end so why upset yourself? ,aries,You will be your usual assertive self today and over the weekend and that’s good because you need to let certain people know that you are serious about your ambitions. Aim high and don’t stop until you reach the top.
aries,Some of the ideas you have this weekend may seem a bit outrageous, at least to other people, but you know they can be made to work. Get your thinking cap on and find ways to make your insights pay, financially and emotionally.
aries,A creative endeavor may have to take a back seat for a while but it’s no big deal – in fact it may even make you more productive in the long term. Stand back from the details of what you are doing and let the bigger picture inspire you.
aries,This week should be noticeably easier than last week and soon you will be back to your best and raring to go. Today, however, you may have to deal with a problem you would like to pretend does not exist. In a few days it won’t. ,aries,What occurs today will cause you to question some of your most deeply-held beliefs. Could they actually be wrong? Could it be the world is not designed the way they told you it was? Time for some deep thinking it seems.
aries,Don’t hesitate to be ambitious. If you dream about moving up in the world, if you want to be someone special, there is a real chance that it might happen this week. At the very least you will lay the foundations for future success.
aries,Make the most of today’s positive influences to start something new. This is a great time for career maters and also for affairs of the heart and over the next few days you may find the two linked in some way. Sounds like fun! ,aries,There is no need to feel threatened by someone whose power exceeds your own. According to the planets they don’t see you as a rival and therefore wish you no harm. If you can, get in their good books – they could be a useful ally.
aries,Someone you live with or work alongside is likely to be in a negative frame of mind this weekend, so steer clear of them if you don’t want their mood to rub off on you. Life is as good or as bad as you choose to make it.
aries,You will need to be ruthless with yourself this week, especially on the work front where you are clearly doing too much. The tasks you are trying to finish may seem important but at least half of them could be postponed indefinitely.
aries,It may seem as if someone has taken advantage of your kindly nature but could it be you are overreacting? Even if they have been less than honest has it done any real harm? Get uptight about it if you want but it’s really not worth the effort. ,aries,You have the gift of the gab at the moment and can get just about anyone to do just about anything for you. Which is nice but try not to abuse the situation or you may have some uncomfortable questions to answer later on. ,aries,You may be in a charitable mood at the moment but don’t get carried away and give away too much. Your luck is certainly changing for the better but you still need to make sure you have enough in reserve to cover unforeseen setbacks. ,aries,Take care that in trying to find a solution to one problem you don’t create several more. If you are not absolutely certain you know what you are doing perhaps you should wait until Monday’s new moon gives you a pointer.
aries,The Sun crosses a major angle of your chart this weekend, making it the ideal time to look into the future and decide what kind of life you would like to be living a few years from now. Set your sights high because all things are possible. ,aries,You should be aiming to improve yourself in one way or another over the next seven days. You don’t have to make fame and fortune your priority but you do have to make the most of your talents – it’s a waste if you don’t.
aries,Colleagues and employers may need some convincing that what you are planning is going to work but that won’t bother you in the slightest because you have total self-belief. It’s going to be a great week for starting new schemes and projects.
aries,You can’t always pound your rivals into submission. Sometimes you need to be a bit more subtle and Saturn’s influence over the next few days will encourage you to think before you act. If you are going to be ruthless with anyone, be ruthless with yourself. ,aries,Someone who needs assistance will turn to you today and you won’t let them down. There are few things you like better than charging to the rescue, especially when you believe that you are backing the underdog against a bully. ,aries,If a friend or family member wants to go their own way and do their own thing then let them. Would you listen to them if they tried to stop you from following your desires? Of course not, so why should they listen to you? ,aries,If you are nice to someone who does not deserve it today you will benefit in unexpected ways early in the new year. People in positions of authority will take note of your attitude and single you out for bigger and better things. ,aries,No task will be too much for you this weekend. You will get stuck in quickly to whatever is expected of you and do the kind of job that is beyond most people’s abilities. But you’re not most people – you’re an Aries! ,aries,Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart means you have what it takes to succeed but it is unlikely to happen until you stop worrying that your desire to get ahead in the world is somehow unnatural. It isn’t, so go for it!,aries,You may be desperate to get things moving again but don’t jump the gun. You will get your chance to shine towards the end of this week but until then you must sit tight and not rock the boat – or it might be you who falls out! ,aries,Whatever happens today, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you must look at it as an opportunity. While others are getting emotional about it you should be evaluating the situation carefully and seeing how you can make it work in your favor.
aries,Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes you intensely ambitious but it can also make you a bit reckless and that could be a problem today. Be warned: if you take a short cut it could lead to some place you don’t want to go. ,aries,Don’t be misled if things seem quiet today – it’s the lull before the storm. The first few days of the new year will be challenging, so conserve your energy for what lies ahead. Since when have you ever met a challenge you could not handle? ,aries,You will come into contact with some powerful people in the early days of the new year. How you deal with these people is of the utmost importance. By all means show them how ambitious you are but don’t be pushy about it. ,aries,Whatever happens today, be it good or be it bad, you won’t care so long as you are in the company of friends. Together you can face whatever challenges life sends your way, though by recent standards they are unlikely to be too tough. ,aries,You may not have a care in the world at the moment but the same cannot be said for everyone you meet. Monday’s full moon will have some of your friends feeling a bit down. What can you do to cheer them up? ,aries,If you get in a fight with someone who is bigger or better connected than you today you will undoubtedly lose, so be smart and back off before the situation gets out of hand. Full moons and confrontations don’t go together. ,aries,Serious thoughts should be shoved to the back of your mind today. This is not a time to focus on money or career matters, this is a time to indulge in the lighter side of life. Make having fun your highest, and only, priority today. ,aries,You will need to control your feelings today, especially if someone you thought you could trust lets you down in some way. There is no point getting upset about something you cannot change – either ignore it or deal with it.
aries,Don’t worry too much about details today. Instead, make a conscious effort to raise your sights and look at the bigger picture. If you don’t, you could miss something important – and that something has the potential to make you rich. ,aries,Anyone who thinks they can get you to believe something that is clearly untrue obviously does not know you too well. Pretend to go along with what they tell you, then turn around at the last moment and tell them to get lost! ,aries,You feel the need to draw attention to yourself and with Jupiter active this weekend that won’t be too difficult. Just be careful you don’t do anything too outrageous because if you do you may not be able to show your face for a while.
aries,A friend or colleague will say something that really worries you during the early part of the week but what you need to realize is they don’t know what they are talking about. There is absolutely nothing to worry about, not for you anyway. ,aries,You may be in a cautious mood as the new week begins but that’s okay because this is a time for thinking things through rather than throwing yourself at life. Be patient and wait until you find something that is worthy of your time and energy. ,aries,Try to be more logical in your thinking. If you look honestly at what happens today you will realize it is nowhere near as bad as certain people try to make out. By all means take it seriously but, no, it’s not the end of the world. ,aries,You need to be less predictable in your words and actions, especially when dealing with co-workers and people in positions of power. Too many people are taking you for granted – and will continue to do so until you do something about it. ,aries,The best way to get what you want right now is to pull strings behind the scenes. If you try to tackle problems head-on today you may find yourself up against people who are stronger and better connected than you – and you’ll lose.
aries,Good fortune is heading your way. You may find that hard to believe but if you adopt a more positive outlook today and over the weekend it will help you to recognize just how lucky you are. Life is good, and getting better by the moment.
aries,You will be called on to make an extremely important decision this weekend and if you get it right you will soon be moving up in the world. It’s not fame and fortune you seek, of course, but you’re not going to turn them down! ,aries,You have started many new things in recent weeks and it is only natural that you are eager to see results. That’s more likely if over the next few days you make friends with people whose dreams in some way reflect your own. ,aries,You may be assertive by nature but you also possess considerable charisma and with Venus so strong in your chart at the moment you will charm the birds from the trees. Say the right things to the right people at the right time and you’ll go far. ,aries,You have started many new things in recent weeks and now you want to see some results. But don’t push too hard as there is still a lot to be done before the big breakthrough comes. You can be patient when you put your mind to it. ,aries,Stick with what you know and trust and don’t be tempted to try something you are not familiar with. Yes, you may be adventurous by nature but with Mercury beginning one of its retrograde phases mistakes are more likely than not, so take care.
aries,Do not, repeat not, get emotional about money. Yes, of course, it’s nice to have enough of the stuff not to have to worry about paying the bills but at the end of the day it’s still just bits of colored paper. Keep a sense of perspective.
aries,This will be a really busy day for you and you will get so many important tasks out of the way. But don’t forget about love. Let that special someone know how you feel and let them see they mean the world to you.
aries,Before you get angry with someone for getting something wrong make sure you know all the facts. You won’t make many friends if your accusations turn out to be unfounded. Sometimes you can be a bit too quick to pass judgment.
aries,This is a busy time for you personally and you are on the go non-stop, but not everyone will be able to keep up. You will get more out of friends and colleagues in the long-term if you let them move at their own pace now. ,aries,A problem of some kind can quite easily be resolved, by ignoring it. This is one of those situations where something is an issue only because you choose to think of it as an issue. So don’t think of it at all. ,aries,Don’t waste time worrying that you may not have the skills or the experience to make a success of a new task or job – others have confidence in you so you must have confidence in yourself. Get used to playing a bigger role.
aries,Travel arrangements may be subject to delays and disruptions today, so give yourself plenty of time to get where you need to be and, if you do get held up, take it in your stride. You won’t be the only one arriving late. ,aries,You will say or do something controversial today and those who are not as open and honest as you won’t like it one bit. Too bad. As far as you are concerned there is way too much conformity in the world. Rock the boat a little. ,aries,Certain people may try to talk you down today but you won’t let it happen. The more they try to convince you that certain goals are beyond your reach the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. No one beats an Aries.
aries,Be tolerant of people whose views and opinions you don’t much like. You are going to have to deal with a wide range of people this weekend and you will deal with them better if you put your personal feelings to one side. ,aries,Someone, somewhere needs your help and once you are aware of that fact you will drop what you are doing and come running to their rescue. No one is as eager to do a good deed as an Aries and you’ll do several this week.
aries,You will be asked to give your opinion on a controversial topic today and you must be honest about what you believe. Others will demand to know whose side you are on and it is in your own best interests to tell them. ,aries,You will work best today if you work as part of a team. Try to remember that a certain amount of tension can be creative and that there is nothing wrong with a bit of dissent – so long as you all agree in the end. ,aries,Some things can be explained purely by logic but what you have to deal with today will require you to use your intuition as well as your intellect. The first explanation that pops into your head is likely to be the right one.
aries,Don’t be in so much of a hurry that you bite off more than you can chew today. If you have to ask for help it won’t look too impressive, will it? Try not to get carried away, especially not on a stretcher. ,aries,Don’t worry about how much something of a creative nature is going to cost you. If your plan is a good one – and it is – then the cosmic powers that be will help you. Take that risk and make it work. ,aries,Switch off this weekend. Worry less. Do less. There may be a dozen things that need to be finished but you don’t need to finish them right now. Life can be as easy or as difficult as you choose to make it.
aries,People you work alongside will be impressed by your attitude over the coming week. They will especially admire the calm way you deal with pressure. Which just goes to show what a good actor you are, because inside you will be quaking with fear. ,aries,You will find it ridiculously easy to get people to do what you desire over the next few days and you should take advantage of it. A smile here and a compliment there and they will be falling all over themselves to do you favors. ,aries,Don’t try too hard to prove yourself to people who you do not respect – in fact, don’t try at all. It does not matter how important they are, you are under no obligation to be nice to them, or even to acknowledge their existence.
aries,You won’t take life too seriously today and that’s good because there are far too many glum faces around as it is. Do whatever takes your fancy, no matter how trivial it may seem to others. If it makes you smile it must be right.
aries,You will notice things today that other people have completely overlooked. But don’t expect many thanks when you point out what they have missed – some people just do not want to be told, not even for their own good.
aries,You were born with special skills and you are determined to make use of them. What happens over the weekend will bring new possibilities and maybe a new friendship or romance to go with it. Life is good and about to get even better.
aries,The Sun moves into the most secretive, sensitive area of your chart on the 18th but there is no cause to worry. It simply means you need to take time out of your busy schedule to think more deeply about your life. ,aries,You may find that some of the things you have been doing in recent weeks no longer have the same hold over you. But don’t think that the time and energy you spent on them has been wasted – on the contrary, it was a good investment. ,aries,You may be fearful for no good reason over the next few days, which is not like you at all. Remind yourself often that what you are anxious about exists solely in your mind and cannot affect you in the world at large. ,aries,There is an air of mystery about you at the moment and others are having a hard time working out what you are up to. Chances are you are not up to anything much at all but it amuses you to have them think otherwise. ,aries,Avoid extremes today, in words as well as actions. Mercury’s link to Saturn means you need to stay on good terms with everyone, but especially with people in positions of power – so think before you open your mouth. ,aries,As your ruler Mars moves into your sign today you will be in an assertive and adventurous mood. Be careful though that you don’t get a bit too domineering for some people’s tastes. You don’t have to be full on every minute of the day.
aries,What would you do if you knew you could not fail? Then do it. The planets guarantee success this weekend, so believe in yourself and what you are doing and go all out to make it work. Your name will soon be up in lights. ,aries,Keep a low profile early in the week, then show yourself towards the end of the week when there are fewer restrictions on what you can do. Also, try to realize that most of the things you have been worrying about exist only inside your head. ,aries,You have been working behind the scenes a lot recently and no doubt that has been frustrating for someone as outgoing as you. On the other hand, being out of the spotlight enables you to do things you don’t want others to see! ,aries,Someone you believed was trustworthy will show their true colors today. It seems they have been keeping things from you and you won’t be too pleased. In a way though they have done you a favor – you certainly know not to trust them again.
aries,You must expect one or two changes today, and if you are smart you will change yourself. The most important change you can make is in your attitude toward other people. Not everyone who disagrees with you has to be an enemy. ,aries,You won’t be in the least bit shy about telling others what you think today but you are expecting too much if you expect everyone to agree with you. Don’t push your viewpoint too hard though or you may lose a few friends.
aries,A clash of egos is likely over the next 24 hours but that’s okay – it’s about time you reminded certain people that you are the boss. Don’t go too far though. Put them in their place by all means but don’t make a big fuss about it.
aries,Enjoy yourself this weekend – do the things that you want to do, not what other people say you should do. With luck planet Jupiter on your side that won’t be too difficult – there is something about you that oozes class and confidence.
aries,You seem to be in everyone’s good books at the moment. What have you done to deserve all this praise? Whatever it is make the most of it because things always change and Thursday’s full moon will bring you down to earth again. ,aries,An older friend or family member will give you some invaluable advice and if you are smart you will take it to heart. You may be doing well at the moment but if you are willing to learn you will soon be doing even better. ,aries,With luck planet Jupiter so strong in your chart this has to be one of the best times of the year for you. No matter how many occasions you have failed in the past you will succeed now, so aim high – then go even higher.
aries,A couple of days from now you will have to start making more of an effort, especially on the work front, but today and tomorrow almost everything will come easy to you. Love will certainly be on the agenda over the next 24 hours.
aries,Today’s full moon suggests you won’t be thinking straight, especially about matters related to your work and your wellbeing. Now that you know that you hopefully won’t take too seriously any doubts and fears that creep into your mind.
aries,By all means do something dramatic and decisive today but make sure you know what you are doing because the planets warn that you could easily overreach yourself. Remember, people in positions of power didn’t get there by being weak.
aries,Don’t make a fuss if a work-related issue does not work out the way you want it to this weekend. In the greater scheme of things it is of only minor importance, so let it pass and focus on something more agreeable, such as your love life.
aries,Mars, your ruler, allied to both Jupiter and Uranus over the next few days makes this the perfect time to start something big. Don’t worry that you may be aiming too high, worry only that you may fall short of your true potential.
aries,Later this month the Sun will move into your birth sign and a new solar year will begin. But you don’t have to wait until then to plan what you are going to do. Start now. The more you look ahead the more successful you will be. ,aries,All things are possible. With your ruler Mars on excellent terms with luck planet Jupiter you can’t help but make a big impression over the next 24 hours. But will it be a good impression? Don’t let your ego get out of hand.
aries,No matter what you are working on and no matter how busy you may be at the moment, you must find an outlet for your physical desires. Mars, your ruler, is so strong today that mental challenges alone won’t be enough.
aries,You may have to rethink some of your plans over the next few days as Saturn begins one of its retrograde phases. Don’t give up on them completely though – just be aware that the road ahead may not be as straight as you imagined.
aries,The universe is pointing you in a particular direction and if you are smart you will go that way as quickly as you can. Of course, being an Aries you are equally as likely to go in the opposite direction just to be different. ,aries,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart is making you feel a bit vulnerable but you are not as fragile as you think you are. What happens over the next 48 hours will force you to toughen up. You’re not a victim.
aries,The Sun moves into your birth sign on the 20th and the world you thought was upside down will suddenly be the right way up again. Between now and then you are advised not to do anything too strenuous. Save your energy for the fun times to come. ,aries,Do something original and meaningful this week, something that makes a difference. What that something is only you can decide but do it with other people rather than on your own. As a group you may, in some small way, change the world. ,aries,If there is something you need to get finished this week you had better get on with it now. When the Sun moves into your sign on Friday there will be so many new things to focus on you won’t have time for yesterday’s aims.
aries,You may want to give someone the benefit of the doubt but a nagging voice in the back of your head warns against it. Today’s Mercury-Neptune link means that trust is something you can give but there is no guarantee it will be repaid. ,aries,Someone will play on your emotions over the next 24 hours, maybe just for the fun of it but maybe also because they think they can get something out of it. Ruin their plans by refusing to get uptight. The more you smile the more you win. ,aries,The Sun moves into your sign today and a new solar year begins. Just how good that year is going to be depends on the thoughts you have and the things you do over the next few days. Think big, act big and achieve big too. ,aries,The Sun in your sign heralds a new beginning, so if you want to make changes now is the time. However, don’t go off in a mad rush because the moon’s eclipse of Mars, your ruler, could lead to mistakes being made. Start slow.
aries,Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts. Disappear off the grid for an hour or two. You need time to think through your problems. Alternatively, talk them over with someone you trust: they’ll have the answers you seek. ,aries,Make sure you know what you are talking about today because if you make things up as you go along you are sure to be found out. It does not matter how confident you sound, if you don’t know the facts don’t pretend that you do. ,aries,Today is a good day for meeting people and making deals. Your powers of persuasion are such that you can get almost anything you desire. But don’t be too pushy, especially on the work front – charm will get you further than aggressiveness.
aries,You feel you could take on the world and win but Saturn warns there are a number of duties and responsibilities you must deal with before you are free to express yourself. They might be boring, but they must be done – and done now. ,aries,You will receive good news today, the kind that could make you some serious money. The only problem is you don’t seem to realize how good it is or how lucrative it could be. Open your eyes before someone beats you to it.
aries,If something feels good then just do it. As long as it is moral (and legal) it does not matter what other people might think about it. You have never been one to let criticism stop you before, so why start now?,aries,You have this nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you have done something wrong but you cannot work out what it is. Most likely it’s just a general feeling of guilt rather than anything specific. You do, after all, like to break rules.
aries,If a relationship is not going well then it is up to you to do something about it. Chances are all you have to do to make things better is to ask your partner why they feel down – and act on what they tell you.
aries,You seem to be working harder than ever but not getting much to show for it. Don’t worry. The Sun in your sign means you are guaranteed some sort of return on the efforts you are making – and when it arrives it will be worth it. ,aries,If you have been looking to get rid of a responsibility that has become a burden then now is the time. The planets make it possible for you to cut important ties without creating resentment, so go for it and don’t look back.
aries,The Sun’s alliance with Jupiter today means you will come up with a solution to a problem before others even realize that a problem exists. This puts you at a huge advantage, personally and professionally – one you are entitled to use.
aries,You tend to prefer reason and logic instead of instinct but the approaching eclipse means you would be wise to listen more to your inner voice. You should also listen to friends and colleagues who know more about an issue than you do.
aries,Yes, of course, you know best but a partner insists that they know better. Today’s eclipse makes it highly unlikely you will be able to compromise, so go your own way and do your own thing and say “I told you so” when they get it wrong.
aries,Start thinking about what new things you would like to do over the next few weeks because you will soon get the opportunity to sweep away the past and make a new beginning. Whatever choice you make it should be a huge success. ,aries,Your confidence is at an all-time high and you honestly believe there is nothing you cannot accomplish. Your capabilities may be immense but make sure you focus on aims that are worth investing your time and energy in. Don’t waste your talents. ,aries,You will go over the top and say something excessive today but as you’re an Aries people tend to expect it of you. Just make sure you aim your barbed comments at people who can speak up and stand up for themselves.
aries,Some topics are best avoided today if you want to steer clear of heated arguments. The problem though is that the most divisive issues tend to be the ones on which you have most to say. Oh go on then, be controversial.
aries,What would you do if you knew that success was guaranteed? So why are you not doing it? The Sun in your sign makes all things possible but you have got to believe in yourself and you have got to be serious about your ambitions.
aries,Someone in a position of authority can and will help you out over the next 24 hours, if you ask them to. Not even an Aries can do it all by themselves, so get assistance if you need it. It never hurts to have powerful friends.
aries,Others can walk around with long faces if they want this weekend but you will be having the time of your life. Travel, socialize and party. Life is simple when stripped down to its essentials, so wear a smile and help others smile too.
aries,You won’t take life seriously over the next seven days and that’s good because there are already far too many people in the world who think it’s all doom and gloom. What is good? What is right? Whatever makes you laugh.
aries,Your passion for an issue or cause of some kind will inspire you to give of your best today. You certainly won’t give ground to those you disagree with so strongly. Compromise is not a word you want anything to do with. ,aries,You like excitement but you need security too and the planets will in some way remind you today that matters of a business and financial nature must not be neglected. Have fun by all means but keep an eye on your cash too.
aries,It seems you can’t put a foot wrong at the moment but you know from long experience not to take things like that for granted – so don’t. Enjoy life by all means but watch where you tread. Avoid the toes of powerful people.
aries,You have no intention of giving in just because someone in a position of power is on your case. Anyone who thinks you will just roll over and play dead today will learn the hard way that you can bite as well as bark.
aries,A new moon in your sign means you need to decide what it is you most want to accomplish over the next six months or so. What you think of today is what you will be doing tomorrow, so think deeply – then take appropriate action.
aries,Anyone who tries to tell you how to live your life will soon wish they had kept their thoughts to themselves. You have no intention of sitting there listening to their lecture. And why should you? You know what your needs are. ,aries,You may not have been serious about a social or political issue in the past but you are certainly serious about it now. You won’t rest until you’ve had your say and made your mark. You could make some money from it too.
aries,You want to make a useful contribution to what’s going on around you but the only way you can do that is to join with other people. You can be a loner if you wish but you will get more done if you are not so aloof.
aries,Just because someone seems to know what they are talking about does not mean you have to trust them – especially when it is your money that is on the line. Make sure you know the risks involved before signing up to anything today.
aries,Everyone gets things wrong once in a while and you are no exception. If you make an error of judgment today – and you will – don’t try to deny it. Accept your mistake then set about putting it right. It’s more than most people do.
aries,No, you are not the most subtle member of the zodiac, but why should you be? Your in-your-face attitude will work in your favor today, especially in your career where you need to be more assertive – yes, even more so than usual!,aries,Uranus in your sign is a fortunate influence and with Venus also strong this weekend you should be lucky in love as well. On the work front, listen to advice but don’t just assume others know what they are talking about. Do your own research. ,aries,You will get your way no matter how many people try to deny you. But make sure what you get is what you really want because once it is yours you will be stuck with it – you won’t be able to change your mind and give it back. ,aries,If something goes wrong over the next 24 hours there are two approaches you can take: either you can look round for someone to blame or you can take responsibility yourself. Make it the latter and make sure the problem gets fixed.
aries,Life is good and getting better by the day, the hour, even the moment. You may find that hard to believe but only because you are focusing on things that are no longer of any importance to you. Expand your horizons, and have fun.
aries,Opportunities to better yourself won’t be hard to find over the next few days, so stay alert and be ready to act when you get the chance. Nothing is impossible if you want it enough and Aries is nothing if not ambitious.
aries,A problem will most likely resolve itself if you stop worrying about it so much. Mercury’s imminent change of sign will help you to focus your thoughts on more constructive issues. Never forget it is your head that makes your world.
aries,Mercury’s change of sign today urges a change in attitude on your part. Try taking a step back from what you have been stressing about over the past few weeks. Most likely you will see that it is not so important after all.
aries,Partners and loved ones may think they know what is best for you, and maybe they do, but that does not mean you should let them take over your life. Once they are allowed to decide one thing for you they will soon want to decide everything.
aries,If you make an effort over the next seven days you will make a major breakthrough. Not everyone will agree with your aims and ambitions but then not everyone possesses your sense of adventure or self-belief. Go for it! ,aries,Don’t worry about today’s full moon – if you think positive then all will be well. Others may not be so lucky, of course, so be ready for one or two emotional outbursts from people who get easily frustrated with life’s little setbacks. ,aries,You may be able to do anything but that does not mean you have to do everything. Decide what it is you are really good at and commit yourself to it 100 per cent. Focus all your energy in one direction and see incredible results.
aries,Meet up with friends and do things together today. And don’t just limit yourself to social activities. If you get the chance to join forces with people who share your aims and ideals then do so. Make the world a better place.
aries,You will need to be on your guard today as someone you work or do business with seems to think you can be easily misled. Check everything you are told, even if it sounds true. Then check it a second time just to make sure.
aries,Be careful what you allow yourself to think about this weekend. With Mercury, planet of the mind, at odds with Neptune, negative thoughts are sure to have negative consequences. Positive thoughts, on the other hand, will bring extraordinary success.
aries,You will want to be on the move over the next few days, so don’t make plans that keep you in one place only. There is a danger that you might be a bit too forceful verbally but that will worry others more than it worries you. ,aries,Do something today that takes the object of your affection by surprise. Think of the most romantic thing you could do, then do it and watch their passion ignite. And plan a trip away together for later in the week or next weekend. ,aries,You have been in one place too long and need to make your escape. The only danger is that in your haste to get away you may go off in a direction that is not at all suitable. Bide your time a few more days.
aries,You don’t lack for confidence at the moment but confidence can only take you so far. At some stage you will have to deliver on all the big promises you have made, to yourself and to others, and that stage may arrive sooner than you think.
aries,This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done. Even the smallest effort on your part will yield remarkable results over the next three or four days, so think what a big effort might accomplish. Go for it!,aries,There will be a lot of extra work to get through this weekend and you will need patience and perseverance aplenty. Knuckle down and make a good job of what you have to do and your efforts will not go unnoticed or unrewarded. ,aries,Because the approaching new moon falls in the money area of your chart there is a good chance that a gamble of some kind will pay off, but you must know what you are letting yourself in for – and what you are doing, of course! ,aries,You don’t have to start something new over the next two or three days but if you do it will most likely be a success. If you are involved in business activities today’s new moon will ensure you make a profit. It’s all good. ,aries,Make things easy for yourself and learn from other people’s mistakes. You can do your own thing in your own way if you wish but wouldn’t it be better to tread in the footsteps of those who have been there and done it before you?,aries,Can you tell fact from fiction? When confronted with two sets of figures today you must not just assume that what the experts tell you is right. Use your powers of logic to cut through the hype and get to the heart of the matter.
aries,Get out and about as much as you can over the next few days. Your bubbly personality will attract people to you and doors will open just when you need them to open. In fact it’s all good, so what are you doing still sitting there?,aries,Venus, planet of harmony, is under pressure today but that does not mean you will be too. You will be okay if you refuse to let problems of a domestic nature get you down. This time tomorrow they won’t even exist, so why worry?,aries,If there is something that needs to be said, something others are afraid to mention because powerful people might disapprove, make it your business to say it and make sure everyone hears. Nothing is as important as freedom of speech. ,aries,You are an individual by nature and must always remain one. While everyone else is following the herd this week you will be looking at the facts calmly and reaching your own conclusions. Most likely they will be the opposite of what everyone else believes!,aries,It does not matter how simple the questions you ask of colleagues and employers today it’s unlikely you will get a simple answer. That does not necessarily mean they are trying to deceive you but you  must be on your guard, just in case.
aries,Are other people dragging their feet or are you moving too fast? Strangely, you will get a lot more done today if you slow down and try to do less – not least because you won’t have to spend so much time correcting your mistakes! ,aries,There is a possibility that you will find yourself in the wrong place, at the wrong time with the wrong group of people today. But don’t worry because you will soon get back to where you should be. Next time, be more careful.
aries,A change in your social or professional standing is likely, but will it be a change for the better or a change for the worse? That depends on how willing you are to move with the times. If you are offered something new but slightly scary … go for it!,aries,Although you always look so self-assured you have doubts like everyone else and some of them could get serious over the next 24 hours. Your best course of action is to ignore them and carry on as if you don’t have a care in the world.
aries,You may think you know what is going on in your immediate environment but chances are you are out of touch. The planets warn that seeing should not necessarily mean believing this weekend, so don’t be too quick to make important decisions. ,aries,Someone you live with or work alongside seems determined to be depressed. Don’t let their negative feelings rub off on you over the coming week. Misery may love company but you are under no obligation to suffer along with them. ,aries,The problem you will be faced with today is the same problem you have faced many times before – so you should, by now, know how to deal with it. Get it right this time and hopefully it won’t bother you again. ,aries,Don’t force yourself to do something you do not enjoy today because it’s unlikely you will make a good job of it. Save your time and energy and enthusiasm for something you want to do, even if you have to wait until the end of the week.
aries,A decision needs to be taken about your financial situation and it is up to you to take it and make it work. Don’t keep quiet and let others call the shots – if you do it is they who will gain and you who will pay.
aries,With Mars, your ruler, on such excellent form at the moment how can you possibly fail? This is one of those occasions when you must take risks, when you must push the limits. For you there are no limits, so light up the sky. ,aries,Better times are on their way and evidence of that will be with you in a matter of days. Venus in your fellow Fire sign of Leo will encourage you to see the harmony that exists in all situations, even the ones that provoke confrontation.
aries,If you are planning a trip or excursion this weekend it may not go as smoothly as you would hope. Someone in your group will let you down and you will have to amend your plans to gloss over their absence. They won’t be missed though. ,aries,There is nothing you cannot do, nothing you cannot accomplish. The Sun’s links with luck planet Jupiter and changes planet Uranus over the next few days will assist you in making the difficult look easy. You’re in a league of your own.
aries,If your instincts tell you to be careful you must not ignore them. Today’s Sun-Jupiter link may make you think you can do as you please but other aspects warn this may be the one time in ten that it goes wrong. Tread carefully. ,aries,You don’t have to do anything special now, you just have to be yourself and follow your instincts. Opportunities will come thick and fast over the next few days and it’s really just a question of how fast you can react to them.
aries,Don’t just sit there brooding about your problems, get up and do something about them. Better still, forget about them altogether and have fun with your friends. Life is only a trial if you choose to make it a trial.
aries,You won’t have to tell others what kind of mood you are in, they will know by the look on your face exactly what you are thinking and feeling. If they are smart they will give you what you desire – or stay out of your way!,aries,Don’t get into an open fight with someone who is stronger or better connected than you. The only way to win is to make them think you are not a threat while quietly looking for ways to put your own interests first. Act smart.
aries,The tempo of life will pick up dramatically this weekend as the Sun unites with your ruler Mars in one of the more active areas of your chart. Remember though that not everyone shares your drive and ambition. You’re in a class of your own. ,aries,Focus on finishing something you have already begun over the next few days, rather than on starting something new. A final push will see you through to the end and bring considerable rewards over the second half of the year.
aries,Saturn moves back into the wealth area of your chart today, which among other things means you must take extra care when dealing with money and business matters. You know the old saying: neither a borrower nor a lender be.
aries,You seem to have a viewpoint on anything and everything and today’s new moon will make you even more opinionated than usual. Not all of them will meet with others’ approval but since when did an Aries care about that?,aries,No matter how far out your ideas may be you can find ways to make them work. It is sometimes said that everyone with a new idea is considered a crank, until the idea works. Your critics will soon be calling you a genius!,aries,Information that could be worth a lot of money will come your way today. You may be tempted to pass on what you learn to your friends but if you are smart you will keep it to yourself. Knowledge is power – and profit too.
aries,Your mind is so active that good ideas are flowing thick and fast. Wherever you are and whatever you may be doing you should keep a pen and some paper close by at all times. Put your thoughts into words the moment they come to you.
aries,Nothing too drastic is likely to occur with the Sun’s change of signs this weekend but you may be more touchy than usual and loved ones will notice the difference. For their benefit and your own try not to get uptight about minor things. ,aries,Something will happen over the next few days that tests your commitment and if you are not 100 per cent certain that you can last the course you may give up. That would be a shame because you are so close to your objective.
aries,Despite what some might say you are under no obligation to like or even approve of everyone you meet. Today’s Jupiter-Uranus link reminds you that we are supposed to be different – it’s what makes the world such an interesting place. ,aries,Something will happen today that makes you wonder if you have gone off in a direction you were not meant to take. However, because mind planet Mercury squares up to Neptune, planet of deception, you must not be hasty. It’s still all good.
aries,If some minor thing goes wrong today don’t get angry and make a big deal of it. Some issues are worth getting worked up about and some issues are not and if you still don’t know the difference it’s time to learn. ,aries,How you choose to react to challenging events will determine just how challenging they are. The most important thing today is that you keep your composure no matter how annoyed you might be. If you lose your temper you lose the battle too. ,aries,You can talk your way out of anything. Your powers of persuasion are second to none. Whether you use this talent wisely remains to be seen but wherever you go and whatever you do today and over the weekend others will be impressed by your words. ,aries,Sit back, close your eyes and think of the big picture. There may be a thousand little details that need to be taken care of at the moment, but who says it has to be you who deals with them? Delegate more and dream more too.
aries,Because the approaching full moon takes place in the career area of your chart you will be hoping to make a good impression when dealing with important people. Don’t do anything too outrageous though. They don’t want fireworks – they just want to see they can trust you. ,aries,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means you are thinking about making big changes. However, you should wait until Thursday’s full moon has come and gone. Chances are you won’t have to change much at all. ,aries,There is something you started but failed to finish. You may think you can just forget about it but it won’t be that easy. What happens today will remind you in rather brutal fashion that everything in life must ultimately be paid for. ,aries,Everything is right with your world at the moment. What you most want to happen will occur at just the right time and in just the right way, and if romance is on the agenda you could find the love of your life.
aries,The best way to resolve a family or relationship issue is by letting partners and loved ones know that as far as you are concerned the matter is ended. As usual they are waiting for you to make the first move – so make it.
aries,Partners and loved ones could be rather touchy over the next few days, so try not to say or do anything that will either make them angry or break down in a flood of tears. If only everyone could be as resilient as you!,aries,Someone in a position of authority will ask you to do something for them and, of course, you will say yes. But don’t sell yourself cheap. A job done well is a job worth getting paid the going rate for – plus a bit extra as you’re an Aries.
aries,Loved ones may not have been supportive of late but don’t worry about it – it does not mean they are turning against you. They have had so many worries of their own to contend with they have not had much time for you, that’s all. ,aries,Like everyone you make your share of mistakes but you are not afraid to admit it, and that fact gives you an edge. While others are still trying to deny that they messed up you will be retracing your steps to see where you went wrong.
aries,People will go out of their way to do you favors today which, of course, makes you suspicious, but there is really no reason why you should think they are playing games with you. Some people like you and genuinely want to help.
aries,Your feelings for a certain individual will reach a peak today and over the weekend. However, the planets warn that this may not be the best time to reveal your true thoughts and intentions – keep them secret just a little while longer.
aries,There is no point insisting that you get your own way this weekend because it isn’t going to happen. The planets warn it would be wiser to give ground now, even on issues you feel strongly about, as it will put you in a winning position later on.
aries,You will be in a rebellious mood over the next few days and will most likely upset a few people. There is just no way you are going to follow orders or follow the accepted way of doing things. Fight the status quo.
aries,A relationship problem must be dealt with this very moment. If you leave it any longer the window of opportunity you now have to make things better will close once and for all. Whatever the issue is, find ways to get over it. ,aries,The one thing you want to avoid is the one thing you need to tackle. Something that has been causing you a great deal of worry must be dealt with today – you cannot afford to just sit there and see what might happen. Be brave.
aries,Your feelings for a certain individual, feelings that you have long kept to yourself, will come to the fore over the next 24 hours and it could cause problems. Why? Because someone will be intensely jealousy that you have a new friend. ,aries,Forget about the past, it is over and done with. Only the future counts and today’s new moon means the future starts for you right here and right now. Don’t hate yourself because you made mistakes – they are the building blocks for tomorrow’s successes.
aries,What you want to do and what you have to do will be two different things today, but there is no point getting annoyed because others have the upper hand and can make life difficult for you if you don’t play ball. It won’t be long before the roles are reversed. ,aries,You seem to be in bit of a rut at the moment and need to think of ways you can make your life more exciting. Changes to your working routine would help. How can you make time for fun when you spend all your time making a living? ,aries,When the Sun joins Jupiter in the most dynamic area of your chart on Thursday you will find that most of your worries fly out the window. A more positive attitude on your part will bring a more positive response from partners and loved ones too. ,aries,You have done a lot of things for loved ones in recent weeks but as from Thursday, when the Sun changes signs, you must start doing more things for yourself. Also, tie up as many loose ends as possible between now and then. ,aries,You may be strong, physically and emotionally, but there is a danger today that you will convince yourself that you can master something that does not come easy to you. It won’t do much for your ego if and when it goes wrong. ,aries,No matter how many times you may have ignored reality in the past you won’t be able to ignore it today. If there is something wrong with a working or romantic relationship you MUST sort it out now. Tomorrow may be too late.
aries,The Sun enters the sympathetic sign of Leo today, marking the start of one of the busiest and most enjoyable times of the year. Try not to waste your time on activities, or people, that bring you no benefit. Make every day and every minute count.
aries,You already know the answers to a particular question, so why are you still asking other people what they think you should do? You don’t need to make decisions by committee, you need to trust your instincts – and act on them. ,aries,You already know the answers to a particular question, so why are you still asking other people what they think you should do? You don’t need to make decisions by committee, you need to trust your instincts – and act on them.
aries,Try not to take yourself too seriously over the next few days. By the time you get to Friday’s full moon you will realize that very few things in life are worth getting worked up about. Make laughter your first reaction, not anger.
aries,There are so many offers for you to choose from and they all sound so good you may find it hard to decide which one to take. Once you have made your selection, stick with it. The less you chop and change the more you will accomplish.
aries,If you are the kind of Aries who enjoys being the boss then what happens over the next few days will give you every opportunity to show your leadership skills. Try to remember though that being the boss is about more than just giving orders.
aries,You must be prepared to defend your beliefs, and fight for them if necessary. The approaching full moon suggests that someone is going to challenge the way you look at the world and if you don’t meet the challenge they will win by default. ,aries,Be careful how you react to criticism today. If you let your enemies see that your feelings are hurt they will go out of their way to say more annoying and unpleasant things about you. Pretend that you are not the slightest bit bothered.
aries,Go with your gut instincts today, even if it means everyone else thinks you are nuts. You may not be able to explain why you feel the way you do but experience has taught you that if you ignore your inner voice you will later regret it.
aries,You’ve had to carry a lot of responsibilities on your shoulders in recent weeks. The good news is that what happens this weekend will help you offload some of your duties and chores. Make sure others do their fair share.
aries,You have been so busy lately that someone you are close to is feeling a bit left out of things. Find ways to remind them that they mean more to you than anything else in the world. Work hard but make time for loved ones too.
aries,You may prefer to focus on the bigger picture but you must also look more closely at the details of what you are working on as the new week begins. You could so easily overlook something important, something that will cause difficulties later on. ,aries,Today’s Venus-Jupiter union will sweep away negative feelings both at home and at work and life will be fun again. It will be even more fun if you go out of your way to help those who are feeling down learn how to smile again.
aries,For each thing you have lost over the past few weeks you have gained something much more valuable, and with each apparent failure you have made long-term success more likely. Cheer up: you have so much to look forward to.
aries,Don’t waste your time and energy and money on things you do not need and on people you do not respect. Just go about your business as usual and resist the urge to get involved in causes and issues that do not concern you directly.
aries,You must control your temper today, even if you have good reason to be angry. The current cosmic picture makes disputes look bigger and more important than they really are, so don’t overreact. Find reasons to enjoy life, not hate it.
aries,As Mars, your ruler, moves into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend you will be blessed with limitless self-belief. If you are the kind of Aries that does not like being the center of attention you will need to get used to it quickly! ,aries,You may not be much for boring details but if you knuckle down and work through what has to be done in a methodical manner you will be amazed by what you accomplish – and you will get plenty of free time later for more interesting things.
aries,Something that seemed so easy to do a little while ago now seems extremely difficult and you cannot work out why. Don’t give up on it though. What happens later in the week will make it easy again, so bide your time.
aries,You honestly believe there is nothing you cannot do and that may be true, but don’t get so carried away with your own brilliance today that you miss a small but important detail that could trip you up and make you look silly.
aries,Jupiter in the work area of your chart is sure to mean extra responsibilities, but if you tackle them in the right spirit and do the best job you can you will make a good impression on colleagues, employers and other important people. Get to it. ,aries,This may be one of the most productive times of the year for you but before you throw yourself at new projects make sure you know what is involved and what you will be expected to invest in the way of time, energy and money.
aries,The Sun in Leo encourages you to be adventurous and today’s new moon will also inspire you to start something new. However, other aspects warn you must make sure that you have prepared the ground thoroughly. Leave nothing to chance.
aries,Make a point of doing things for other people this weekend, because what you do for them now they will do for you later, plus some extra. Helping others does not mean that you will lose out in some way – in fact the opposite is true. ,aries,You may have more energy and stamina than most but there is a danger this week that you will work too long and too hard and exhaust yourself both physically and mentally. Like everyone else you are only human, so treat yourself gently. ,aries,It’s no big deal if you feel a bit left out of things. Today’s cosmic activity means you are sending out signals to those around you that you don’t want to be bothered too much and friends and colleagues are simply respecting your unspoken wishes.
aries,Try not to be so open about your plans. Do you really need to tell everyone what you intend to do? The planets indicate you should keep your aims and ambitions to yourself, if only to make sure your rivals don’t get a chance to oppose them.
aries,You will be at your fun-loving best today but watch out for people who get their kicks from disrupting other people’s enjoyment. If it happens, don’t get angry because that will only encourage them. Grit your teeth and make out you don’t care.
aries,You may not change your point of view often but when you do you go all the way – it’s more a transformation that an adjustment – and that is what will happen today. You will be a totally different, and better, person come tomorrow morning. ,aries,You may want to take some kind of gamble today but with the Sun at odds with Saturn that might not be such a good idea. You are advised to remember that there are no easy routes to success: it takes hard work, stamina and common sense.
aries,You are wasting too much time and too much energy on things of no importance. The Sun’s move into the work area of your chart this weekend makes this the perfect day to start reorganizing your life. Get rid of everything that isn’t essential.
aries,If you give in to unreasonable demands this week you can be sure there will be more demands to follow, so let others know that your own needs must come first and, if your needs conflict with their needs, it means they lose out. Too bad.
aries,Something you have always accepted as true, mainly because people who seemed to know what they were talking about told you so, is about to be revealed as, at best, a hoax and, at worst, a lie. You may never trust so-called “experts” again. ,aries,A confident approach is a must today. If your rivals get the idea that you are having doubts they won’t hesitate to exploit them and that could lead to a serious setback later in the week. Pretend you don’t have a care in the world.
aries,Good news of one sort or another will come your way today but maybe it would be smart not to read too much into it. As always in life you get nothing for free, not even from people who are generous by nature, so be careful. ,aries,Negative feelings of one sort or another could come to the surface as the full moon draws close, but if you deal with them openly and honesty they should not bother you too much. Don’t try to avoid reality – deal with it. ,aries,No matter how tempted you may be to mess about with something that, while not working perfectly, is still going okay, you must resist the urge. If you make unnecessary changes today you could do more harm than good.
aries,You may be extremely ambitious but there is a danger that you have set your sights so high that it will take almost superhuman efforts to reach your goals. Try winding down a bit. Take the weekend off and return to the fray refreshed on Monday.
aries,Others will find it easy to influence you this week, and with Venus, planet of love and luxury, linked to your ruling planet Mars you could splash out on gifts for people who may not deserve them. You don’t have to treat everyone. ,aries,The way to resolve some kind of crisis is to approach it indirectly. With Venus linked to your ruler Mars early in the week there is no point being blunt or direct because that will only hurt others’ feelings and make matters worse. ,aries,Your confidence is sky high now and no matter what challenges come your way today you will deal with them all with ease. Having said that, you don’t have to do it all by yourself. Friends and colleagues will assist you if you ask them.
aries,Everything in life ultimately happens for a reason, so don’t get uptight if what occurs today is not to your liking. What you call “bad luck” may in fact be good luck, only your perspective is too narrow to see it as such.
aries,You need to find a balance between those parts of your nature that like to feel secure and those parts that like to take a risk. Creatively and romantically this is potentially a great time for you. Don’t waste it on indecision or self-doubt.
aries,Someone will turn up the pressure on you today but you will refuse to be beaten. There is a determination about Aries that makes you a formidable enemy and the more others attack you the more you will dig in your heels.
aries,You are determined to do something constructive with your talents, something that makes a difference. Make sure it is something that includes other people and make sure it is something you will still be proud of many years from now.
aries,You cannot go wrong where affairs of the heart are concerned over the next few days. As love planet Venus moves in your favor again relationships of all kinds will go well, but a word of warning: don’t make promises you may find hard to keep.
aries,Avoid people and places that are likely to confuse you this week. Even the smallest of setbacks could see your confidence suffer a fall, so focus on things that you are familiar with, things that inspire you rather than worry you.
aries,It does not matter if others doubt your abilities – you know you have what it takes to succeed and no one and nothing can stop you. Today’s Mars-Uranus link will multiply your confidence tenfold. You are a force of nature that cannot be stopped. ,aries,There is no point trying to force others to see things your way because that will make them even more determined to take an opposing viewpoint. All you can do is present them with the facts and let them make up their own minds. ,aries,You will be required to put other people’s desires ahead of your own over the next few days but that’s okay. In fact, working with others, both at home and at work, will be a great deal of fun, both for them and for you.
aries,The most important thing today and over the weekend is that you make a serious effort to get along with people. You will be forgiven almost any transgression but in return you must not get angry every time others get something wrong. ,aries,Chances are you have been working too hard and need to slow down a bit and this weekend’s eclipse will make it easy for you. You don’t have to ask anyone’s permission to reschedule your life. Others will have to fit in with you. ,aries,Your money situation will improve over the next few days, but that is not an excuse to go on a spree. Also, don’t be afraid to be a bit more pushy on the work front because employers and other important people will admire your can-do attitude.
aries,The final piece of a puzzle you have been struggling with will fall into place over the next two or three days. Once you can see the entire picture you will know why it took so long to make sense of it. You’ll enjoy the view too.
aries,You may be convinced that a certain course of action is correct but the strength of someone’s opposition will make you wonder if you have really got it right. Maybe you should give it a bit more thought. After all, what’s the rush? ,aries,Your ideas may be amazing but unless you find practical ways of applying them to your everyday affairs they won’t do you much good. All you need is one simple idea that can be consistently applied – then you’ll find fame and fortune.
aries,A relationship may be going through a rough patch but the planets indicate there is nothing to worry about. Even so, you could still make things easier for yourself by not giving them the impression you don’t care, when you really do.
aries,Be fair and compassionate but don’t give others the impression that they can do as they please. The planets indicate that someone will try to make a drama out of what is really just a minor setback – but only if you let them.
aries,You may want to protect a friend from the consequences of their actions but deep down you know that’s not right. The only way they are going to learn from their mistakes is if they are on the receiving end for a change. Let it happen. ,aries,You may be a bit behind in your workload but there is still time to catch up. Make a start right this moment and before the Sun changes signs on Wednesday you will be well on top of things again – until next time anyway!,aries,Your priority today is to keep certain situations, and certain people, at arm’s length while you sort yourself out. A colleague will come up with a well-meaning suggestion but don’t be tempted – the less you do on the work front today the better.
aries,Because the Sun now moves into your opposite sign of Libra it may at times seem as if everything you do is dictated by other people. But even if that is true it does not mean that things won’t work out in your favor. Go with the flow. ,aries,Now that the Sun is moving through your opposite sign of Libra you should find it a lot easier to sit down with others and discuss your problems. If you are prepared to meet them halfway your relationships will go from strength to strength.
aries,You will be impatient of restriction and intolerant of people who in one way or another don’t live up to your expectations. Be careful who you clash with though because if you upset the wrong people you could make some powerful enemies.
aries,Make a list of all the things in your life you would like to end, then make a list of all the things you would like to begin. On Monday, when there is a lunar eclipse in your sign, you will get the chance to start transforming your life. ,aries,The lunar eclipse in your sign will make you hugely assertive as the week begins, but try not to be openly aggressive. If you go over the top others will respond in kind and before you know it you will have a war on your hands. ,aries,If you are not entirely happy with the way your life is going at the moment then do something about it. Today’s lunar eclipse in your sign will make it easy for you to get rid of the old and make room for the new. Start now!,aries,You are stuck in a rut and need to find ways to make life more rewarding and exciting. Changes to your working routine can play a big role, so make that top of the list of things that need to be done. Work smarter, not harder.
aries,Don’t let your rivals see that you are worried or they will play on your fears. Today’s Sun-Mercury link may give them the upper hand but you are under no obligation to make things easy for them. Act as if you are super confident. ,aries,Your imagination is so powerful at the moment there is a danger you could let your fears get out of hand. There are two ways to deal with your current dilemma: either do something about it or act as if it does not exist.
aries,A certain individual may not deserve your support but you will give it anyway. Chances are you will be in need of assistance yourself over the next few days, and you are more likely to get it if others think they owe you something. ,aries,There will be times this weekend when it seems as if the world is against you, but you know it isn’t true. What is true is that the Sun in your opposite sign gives others the upper hand, at least for a while. It’s no big deal.
aries,Be pragmatic over the coming week – deal with situations as they arise and on their own terms. There is no point complaining that others are dragging their feet because that will only encourage them to do it still more. Lighten up, it’s life.
aries,You may want to start something new but before you do it might be an idea to get the views of people you know you can trust. The planets warn there may be something you have missed, something that could cause problems later on.
aries,A relationship problem needs dealing with – not later on but right now. If you leave it even one more day you will find that the window of opportunity that is now open will shut for good. If the relationship means something to you then save it! ,aries,Things are going well for you at the moment but today’s Mars-Neptune link may make it a bit harder to get along with someone on the work front. The fact is you can quite easily get along without their help, so don’t worry about it. ,aries,Like everyone you can be a creature of habit but with so much cosmic activity taking place in the work area of your chart at the moment you must strive to be more original. Don’t do what has been done before – create your own pathway to success. ,aries,One day soon you will look back and laugh at the things you allowed yourself to get worked up about. That day will come sooner if you refuse to give in to the emotional side of your nature, as it allows others to manipulate your feelings.
aries,You have allowed certain situations to slide and if you don’t do something about them soon they may be beyond your control for good. It seems you have relied too heavily on others to make decisions for you – and that’s not like you at all Aries!,aries,Don’t waste your precious time trying to convince people that what you are about to do is right and proper. You should have enough confidence to just do it and not worry about the consequences. Some will like it and some will not. So what? ,aries,Do certain events seem to be repeating themselves? If so it might be a smart move to question the way that you do things. Today’s Sun-Uranus link suggests the time is ripe for a major change in certain routines – and certain relationships too.
aries,The more you try to force events in one direction the more they seem to move in the opposite direction. Have you got the message yet? Today’s new moon in your opposite sign is an invitation to go with the flow. It won’t be so bad. ,aries,According to the planets you have buried your feelings at such a deep level it seems they no longer exist. But they do and at some stage over the next few days you need to let at least one special person know you still love them. ,aries,How can you be sure that someone is telling you the truth? You can’t, but it doesn’t matter. The planets indicate that even if they are lying no harm will come of it. Focus on what matters to you today – an affair of the heart most likely!,aries,You may suspect that someone is taking advantage of your easygoing nature but don’t make a fuss about it. There is no percentage in getting angry with people who take a little bit for themselves at your expense. You can afford to be generous.
aries,Mars and Jupiter in the wellbeing area of your chart warn you must take care of your health. No matter how ambitious an Aries you may be if you take on too much over the next 48 hours you will regret it. Be kind to yourself. ,aries,Your attitude to life will get a bit more serious over the next few days. You will certainly no longer be willing to give others the benefit of the doubt when they mess things up, especially if you think they are doing it on purpose. ,aries,Good fortune of one sort or another will come your way this week and don’t let anyone tell you that you do not deserve it. On the work front especially you will see openings and opportunities before your rivals are even awake.
aries,In one area of your life at least your efforts are about to pay off. However, other aspects warn that your health could suffer if you overdo it physically. You need to get the balance between work and play just right. Make that your aim today.
aries,Tackle problems one at a time today or you will get confused and your efforts won’t amount to much. There may be one or two minor nuisances between now and the Sun’s change of signs on Friday but nothing you cannot comfortably handle. ,aries,A snap decision is called for and there is no way of knowing whether it will turn out to be right or wrong. The worst thing you can do though is to make no decision at all, so call it as you see it and hope for the best. ,aries,As the Sun moves into one of the more secretive areas of your chart today you will be open to asking questions about who you really are and what really motivates you. Don’t be afraid to probe into areas of your mind that you would normally avoid.
aries,Something will happen this weekend that seems a bit unreal but the planets suggest it won’t affect you in a negative way. Health matters will also be important over the next 48 hours. Make sure you get plenty or rest and fresh air. ,aries,Something to do with money or possessions may catch you out this week. Have you overlooked something important? Something that could cost you? According to the planets you have, so get your act together and do what you can to limit the damage.
aries,Be careful how you react to criticism today because if you let rivals see that your feelings are hurt they will take advantage of it. This is still a good time for getting things done and for enjoying yourself. Don’t let anyone burst your bubble. ,aries,As today’s full moon takes place the area of your chart that governs what you own and what you earn you would be wise not to be too extravagant, or too generous. Keep something in reserve – you will need it later in the week. ,aries,Try not to get involved in a quarrel that is really none of your business, because not only will you not be able to resolve it but there is a strong chance the opposing parties will get together and end up taking it out on you. ,aries,You need to get over worrying about other people’s reactions, because you will soon have to do something that not everyone will agree with. It’s not like you to have such a thin skin – usually you could not care less what others think about you!,aries,You will get the chance to make a breakthrough of some kind today and over the weekend. However, you must be aware of your limits and you must not push yourself too hard. You don’t have to work 24/7 to be a success.
aries,Steer clear of people who only ever find reasons not to do things – they will undermine your confidence and soon you will start wondering if certain goals are beyond you. Nothing is ever beyond an Aries – never forget that!,aries,You will be thrust into the spotlight over the next few days and you should take the opportunity to shine and show what you can do. If you get noticed, someone in a position of power could make you the kind of offer you won’t want to refuse. ,aries,You must be scrupulously honest over the coming week. Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs joint money matters warns you stand to lose a lot if partners and business associates get the impression that you cannot be trusted.
aries,You have pushed yourself hard in recent weeks and may need to slow down a bit. Today’s Venus-Mars union encourages you to spend less time at work and more time with the people you love – and one very special person in particular.
aries,Something will happen today that makes you wonder if maybe you were a bit too eager to judge someone. Yes you were. Fortunately, your mistake won’t cost you much this time but if you are wise you will check your facts in future.
aries,If someone makes you a really good offer today you should find out if there are any strings attached. You should know by now that nothing comes for free and if they are giving something to you they will most likely require something in return.
aries,Push yourself forward today and show the world what you are capable of. Today’s Sun-Pluto link will make you even more ambitious than usual, so any opportunities that come your way to improve your position will be gratefully received, and used. ,aries,Don’t be afraid to question what other people tell you over the next 48 hours, especially if what they say sounds suspicious. Just because they are considered to be experts on a certain subject does not mean they are sure to be right. ,aries,The more others try to persuade you that you can trust their advice the more suspicious you should be. Cosmic activity in the wealth area of your chart warns they may be aiming to take advantage of your generous nature. Don’t fall for it. ,aries,Try not to get uptight if someone you live, work or do business with refuses to see sense today. You may have more than enough evidence to convince them that they are on the wrong track but some people can be ridiculously stubborn. Let it go.
aries,You may be tempted to kick up a fuss because someone has let you down today but ask yourself: is it worth the effort? Life will only be an ordeal if you make it an ordeal, so sit back, relax and watch the world go by.
aries,Today’s new moon in the wealth area of your chart makes this the ideal time to make changes to your financial set-up. You may have to make some short-term savings but in the long-term you will be happier and healthier for them. ,aries,As Mars moves into your opposite sign today you will have to confront your feelings about someone you deal with on a daily basis. You may not like them much but in some way your fates are linked, so do what you can to keep things friendly.
aries,As a cardinal sign you are hugely ambitious and you don’t mind when the pressure is on – in fact you thrive on it. What happens today and over the weekend will give you every opportunity to prove yourself. Be amazing, Aries. ,aries,Try not to take out your frustrations on partners and loved ones this weekend – it’s not their fault that you are feeling a bit under the weather. The best way to get over whatever is worrying you is to work out what caused it. ,aries,The message of the stars for the next few days is: don’t try so hard. As mind planet Mercury turns direct and then moves into one of the best areas of your chart you are sure to be guided in the right creative direction. Let it happen.
aries,The more others agree with each other today the more you will want to disagree. Maybe you are being perverse for the fun of it but just as likely you have subconsciously noticed something that suggests they have got it wrong. Always trust your instincts.
aries,If there is something about your current situation that you do not like there is nothing stopping you from changing it. Before you do though, ask yourself honestly if you really dislike it that much or if you are just bored. Tomorrow you may feel differently.
aries,Don’t look back and wonder what might have been – look forward and create a bright new future for yourself. Any regrets you still have about what you should or should not have done must be dealt with today, then forgotten once and for all.
aries,You may sympathize with a friend’s problems but it is not your job to put things right for them. Sometimes it is better to let others find their own answers and this, it seems, is one of them. Only step in if things really start to get bad. ,aries,Know when to push for what you want but also when to back off. With both the Sun and Mercury moving into one of the best areas of your chart over the next few days it won’t take much effort to get the good things in life.
aries,You will find a new sense of direction and motivation when the Sun moves into your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius tomorrow. Most importantly you won’t let minor doubts and fears hold you back the way they have done in recent weeks. It’s all good!,aries,This is a good time of year for you but it could be a great one if you stop worrying about things that might go wrong and give yourself over to having a good time. Remember, though, that definitions of a good time vary from person to person.
aries,No matter how strong your opinions may be you are advised to keep them to yourself over the next few days. If you say the wrong thing you could make an enemy of someone quite powerful. Don’t make things unnecessarily difficult for yourself.
aries,Someone you have always thought of as a rival will surprise you today by saying something that makes you feel good about yourself. Is it some kind of trick? No it is not. They really do want to be nice to you. Be nice in return. ,aries,Ignore what others say you should be doing and do what feels right to you. If you listen to their advice you will get nowhere, so trust your own instincts today and, most importantly, act on what they tell you. You won’t be disappointed. ,aries,Demand only the best – and you will get it. With the Sun moving through one of the most dynamic areas of your chart you only have to click your fingers for others to come running to grant your requests. Will you abuse this ability? Of course you will!,aries,If someone places an obstacle in your path your first reaction will be to smash it to pieces. However, the planets warn that such an extreme reaction could have unforeseen consequences, so look for a compromise solution – it won’t be hard to find. ,aries,You will be in the public eye a lot over the next 48 hours but don’t forget that with recognition comes responsibility, so make sure what you say and do is fair because others will be watching you closely, either to learn or to criticize. ,aries,You will be called on to lead by example over the next few days, especially on the work front. Show others that it is possible to do well and reach the top without resorting to underhand methods. Be fair and you will make a big impression.
aries,Don’t fall into the trap of telling partners and colleagues what you think they want to hear. They are smarter than you give them credit for and will notice if your words sound insincere. Tell the truth, no matter how much you think it might hurt them. ,aries,You will be at your most generous and understanding today – you will do anything for anyone no matter how much it might cost you personally. Don’t worry if some people try to take advantage of you – they will get what they truly deserve in the end. ,aries,You may want to bring a feud to an end but don’t give too much away. If you offer a compromise solution you must do so from a position of strength. If you give in too easily your rivals may take it as a sign of weakness. ,aries,You feel you should be doing more, you feel you should be pushing yourself harder – and you are right, you should. You have been rather lazy of late and you do need to make up for wasted chances. Start now, then carry on. ,aries,You may have your suspicions about someone’s motives but don’t go public with them yet. Even if your suspicions are correct it will look to others as if you are being vindictive and it could be your reputation that suffers the most.
aries,As Venus, planet of affection, moves into one of the more secretive areas of your chart this weekend it’s possible you could develop a crush on someone. The bad news is it’s unlikely you will be able to get a relationship going. But you can dream.
aries,Someone will say something hurtful this week but you must not take it to heart. According to the planets they are not being deliberately rude, they just don’t understand the effect their words can have on people of a sensitive disposition. And that includes you. ,aries,Cosmic activity in one of the more adventurous areas of your chart urges you to strike out in a new direction. Don’t think about it or you will come up with a thousand reasons for not moving forward. Just act and deal with the consequences later.
aries,You may do something today that other people do not approve of but no way will you change course because of it, it’s just not your style. If anything you will rather enjoy being singled out for so much attention. Besides, all publicity is good publicity. ,aries,Today’s positive influences will make you feel at one with the world. The truly important things in life, such as love and family, will come into focus and the not-so-important things, such as money and ambition, will be seen for the illusions they are. ,aries,Put all doubts and fears out of your mind and do what you think is best. As from today you will have a much clearer picture of what needs to be done and you will have the courage to make it happen. Don’t hesitate. Just act. ,aries,Everything should be going well for you now, both in your personal life and at work, and today’s new moon in your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius will make life even more enjoyable over the next couple of days. It’s all good. No, really.
aries,You must be honest with yourself this weekend, even if it means you have to admit that you have taken on too much and must now let someone down. Even an Aries can make mistakes, so hold up your hand and admit you got it wrong.
aries,Over the next few days you will wonder why you allowed yourself to get so wound up about things you now see do not matter in the slightest. Any lingering doubts or fears or hang-ups you have are about to head for the door.
aries,Watch your back today and think twice before giving anyone the benefit of the doubt. The Sun may be moving through your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius but so is Saturn, planet of limitation, and that means someone may be working against you.
aries,You seem much more easy-going of late and that’s good. However, where money and business matters are concerned you cannot afford to be too laid-back or you will attract hangers-on and spongers and find yourself out of pocket. Watch your cashflow today. ,aries,You will thoroughly enjoy what happens today, even if others do not. The influence of Uranus in your sign makes it easier for you to accept upheavals and, while Uranus is moving retrograde at least, to see the positive side in negative events. ,aries,In your rush to get ahead of the game you may take on too much and exhaust yourself. You may sometimes have the strength to do two or even three jobs at once but if you do too much now you may regret it later on. Slow down. ,aries,If you have not yet done something marvellous don’t worry because there is still time – just. Make your move today and over the weekend, certainly before the Sun changes signs on the 22nd. People in positions of power will be watching you closely.
aries,A relationship has reached a turning point – maybe even a point of no return – and before the weekend is over you will have to decide what to do about it. It could cause all sorts of problems if you allow it to drag on much longer.
aries,Go all out to impress people in positions of authority over the next few days. As the Sun moves into the career area of your chart you will find it easy to get ahead, especially if you are willing to take on more responsibility. Go for it!,aries,You will realize today that what you were hoping for is not going to happen, but that’s no bad thing. On the contrary, it will free your mind from the straight-jacket it has been locked in these past few weeks, enabling you to see new possibilities. ,aries,Have no doubts: you are on your way up in the world. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart means if you have a plan and if you make a serious effort there is nothing you cannot accomplish over the coming weeks and months. ,aries,Go your own way and do your own thing and don’t expect much support from partners and colleagues. You will soon discover that you are better off without their help anyway. You know what needs to be done, so get on and do it.
aries,You need to make a bold decision. You need to choose between one approach and another. The only danger is that you will make your decision more for emotional reasons than for logical reasons. Think before you act, then act quickly.
aries,What seems like a self-evident fact now may turn out to be total fantasy later on, so be careful. If you find yourself in a situation where you are the only one who seems to know what is going on it could be you are deceiving yourself.
aries,You may have decided that you no longer want to work with someone, but how do you go about making the break? Don’t worry about hurting their feelings – you must be ruthless and leave them in no doubt that it’s over.
aries,You want to get away from your usual environment and explore places you have not been in a while. You will have a lot of fun but make sure your wanderings are over and done with by midweek as journeys may be unpredictable later on.
aries,You don’t have to do anything special or go anywhere new to attract what you need today those things will find you if you stay right where you are. Let others run around and tire themselves while you relax and enjoy the good things in life.
aries,There may be obstacles blocking your path no matter which way you turn, but don’t let it get to you. Come the early days of the new year your life will be far less encumbered by things and by people you wish were not there. ,aries,Things have been going so well of late that you might be wondering what the catch is. Don’t worry, it’s not some kind of cosmic trick to lull you into a false sense of security. You are being rewarded for all the hard work you have put in. ,aries,The planets warn if you intend to talk big today you will need something more than bravado to back it up with. Watch out you don’t find yourself up against someone who not only knows how to talk the talk but to walk the walk as well. ,aries,What occurs this weekend will in some way remind you that your life has significance. Others can be cynical and choose to believe that nothing really matters if they so wish but you know that in the greater scheme of things everything is important. ,aries,You have always been a seeker after truth and will go even further in your quest for enlightenment over the coming week. Something you see or hear will open your mind to new possibilities. It could be you are on the verge of a huge discovery.
aries,If you think you cannot lose then you are already halfway toward winning. A positive mental attitude is a must now as you have so many things to do. Some say you are being too optimistic but the fact is you can never be optimistic enough. ,aries,Little things that used to worry you will seem less important as from today. However, where money matters are concerned be careful you don’t let things slide because the line between making a profit and making a loss is not as wide as you seem to imagine.
aries,Take the initiative and make things happen. If you sit around waiting for others to make the first move it’s unlikely you will get anywhere worth going. Aries is a Cardinal sign, meaning you have leadership qualities, so get out there and lead the way. ,aries,What happens today will take you by surprise no matter how well prepared you may be. Changes on the work front may be unsettling but if you stay calm and use your head you can easily find ways to turn them to your advantage. ,aries,If something out of your past catches up with you today don’t ignore it or deny it. Look at it instead as a wonderful opportunity to make amends for something you did that you have always regretted. A simple “sorry” will most likely be enough.
aries,A huge burden will be lifted from your shoulders this weekend. Something of an emotional nature that you have been carrying for so long will suddenly no longer be there and you will feel lighter than air. Watch out you don’t float away! ,aries,The more you try to influence events the less you will be able to do so, so stop trying so hard. That applies to all areas of your everyday life but in particular to your work situation. Leave well alone and let fate take its course.
aries,Good things and good people will come into your life over the next seven days. You are so popular that your name is at the top of everyone’s guest list. Your only problem is going to be finding the time to keep your many admirers happy.
aries,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that rules your vocation is urging you to aim higher than you have ever done before. Don’t let the critics and the cynics hold you back by undermining your confidence. Anything is possible if you want it enough. ,aries,Play by the rules and don’t cut corners. There is a lot at stake now and while it may seem as if no one is watching they almost certainly are. Act as if the eyes of the world are upon you – and make sure the world likes what it sees. ,aries,Push yourself hard today. Make an extra special effort to get things done on time and to a high standard. You are sure to be rewarded in some way and employers and other important people will think more highly of you in future. ,aries,As Mercury, planet of communication, is going through one of its retrograde phases you would be wise to think before you speak, especially on the work front where colleagues and employers will not take kindly to criticism. Weigh your words carefully. Do they really have to be said?,aries,If you adopt a confident attitude this weekend you will accomplish great things, both in your private life and in your work. Go your own way and do your own thing and others will look at you like you are someone special – which, of course, you are.
aries,Some things are important and some things are not and you must focus on the former only over the next few days. You also need to remember that, while your professional status may be important, it is your home life on which long-term success is built.
aries,Try to be a bit more relaxed this week. The most important thing is that you keep a sense of perspective and remember that no matter how hard you try to get ahead in the world it’s the personal side of life that matters most. ,aries,You need to be aware of the fact that no matter how ambitious and active an Aries you may be there are only 24 hours in a day and if you want to do more in one direction in the future you will have to do less in another.
aries,Group and social activities will become more important now that the Sun is moving in your favor again. Join forces with like-minded people over the next few weeks and see how far you can travel together. Find new ways to improve the world.
aries,Even if you sometimes find it hard to connect with people emotionally you will do so with ease over the next few days. The planets will help you empathize with those who, under normal circumstances, you might find it hard to feel sorry for. ,aries,Don’t limit yourself to tried and trusted ways of doing things today. If you are open to new possibilities you may find this is the ideal time to come up with new ideas and impress people in positions of power. You may even impress yourself!,aries,Changes of one sort or another have come thick and fast in recent weeks and not all of them have been welcome. Today, however, you will realize there is a pattern emerging, a pattern that is pointing you in a new and more profitable direction.
aries,There is no point complaining about other people’s behavior this week because it’s unlikely they will listen. A Leo full moon means you won’t get a fair hearing, even if all the evidence is on your side. Save your voice and your energy for another day.
aries,Some people might lose heart at the tasks that await you but you are not some people you are an Aries. Today’s cosmic activity will inspire you to aim for the top. It won’t be long before you are looking down on everyone else.
aries,The critics may say you’ve been lucky, and maybe you have, but luck is only part of the story – you do in fact deserve your success. Your task now is to do something with what you have got, not just for yourself but for other people too.
aries,Try not to get involved in people’s problems today – or they may become your problems too. You may want to help a friend in need but on this occasion it’s better if they learn how to take care of certain issues for themselves. ,aries,Don’t back off and refuse to interact with the world. The only way you are going to get past your problems is by rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck in to whatever it is that is making you feel blue. What happened to that Aries spirit! ,aries,Why do you feel that someone is watching you? Is it because you have a guilty conscience? According to the planets you may have done something wrong and think others can tell just by looking at you. But they can’t, so stop worrying. ,aries,Good news will come your way over the next 48 hours, the kind of news that cheers you up no end. If it involves a job offer or a chance of a promotion you must be bold and seize the moment. Never doubt that you are good enough.
aries,You must do whatever it takes to protect your interests. Let friends, family and work colleagues know that you will not allow yourself to be pushed around or taken advantage of. A little bit of aggression – but only a little bit – is sometimes a good thing.
aries,Your ability to charm your way into other people’s affections will take you far. You will get your way, both at home and at work, simply by telling friends and relatives what they want to hear. It may not be true but it makes them feel good. ,aries,If you allow negative thoughts to take over today then, inevitably, negative results will most likely follow. If, however, you make an effort to think positive no matter what kind of situation you find yourself in, it should all come right. Your mind creates your reality.
aries,You may feel as if you can take on the world and win, and maybe you can, but don’t get over-confident or you could be in for a major let-down. Life always moves in cycles and nothing stays the same for long. Be ready for change. ,aries,They say that opposites attract and someone who is as different from you as it is possible to get will have your pulse racing. No doubt you will recover your senses before you take it too far but, who knows, it could be the love of your life. ,aries,What you wish for in life is what you ultimately get but that can be both positive and negative. If you believe something good will happen it most likely will, but if you believe something bad will happen that too will occur. Think only upbeat thoughts today.
aries,No doubt you are fired with enthusiasm for your next big project but don’t get carried away. By all means act swiftly and decisively but make sure that what you do is backed up by facts, not by fantasies and imaginings, fun though they may be. ,aries,Whatever it is you are currently working on you will know without a shadow of a doubt what needs to be done to make a success of it. But you cannot do it all on your own, so enlist the help of those who share your ambitions.
aries,Don’t believe what others tell you just because they claim to be in the know. The world is full of people who all too often don’t understand even the basics of what they are talking about. The only advice you need is what your inner voice tells you.
aries,If you let things slip, even for a moment, you will be struggling to catch up for the rest of the week. You must stay on top of your workload, no matter how boring it may be. Cut yourself off from distractions and do what must be done. ,aries,If you have not yet been rewarded for the time and effort you have put into your work you will be over the next few days. But no matter what you receive it won’t match the pride you have in yourself for doing such an excellent job.
aries,Others may say that you are aiming too high and maybe they are right but they could also be worried that you will succeed in what you are trying to do and in the process show them up. Keep doing what you are doing, only better. ,aries,Forget about what others expect and do only what interests you personally. But you don’t have to do it on your own. Group activities are under excellent stars at the moment, so get together with people who share your vision and do something worthwhile.
aries,Stay focused and keep your ultimate goal in mind at all times. If you let your attention wander you will find it very hard to get back to what you should be doing. You know what it is you desire, so don’t let anything distract you.
aries,You need to do something about your cashflow situation – fast! You also need to stop spending money on things you know you don’t need. Finally, and most importantly, don’t get caught up in one of those you can’t lose, get-rich-quick schemes – they’re a con.
aries,You seem to have an obsession with perfection but you must understand that not everyone shares your need to get it right every time. Be warned: if you push others too hard today it might tempt them to be obstructive, or even destructive! ,aries,You have learned a lot in recent weeks and now you must start to apply it to your everyday life, even if it means the kind of upheavals you usually try to avoid. What is the point of knowing something if you don’t use it? ,aries,You should feel an easing of the restrictions, especially financial restrictions, that you have been laboring under in recent weeks. However, that is not an excuse to go on a spree. If you do you will regret it later when confronted with the bill! ,aries,The next few weeks won’t always be easy but try not to make them harder than they have to be. A lot will depend on your attitude, especially your willingness to rise to a challenge rather than be intimidated by it. Believe in yourself — always. ,aries,Stick to what you know best this weekend and don’t let others persuade you to change your ways just to keep up with the latest fads or fashions. As the first sign of the zodiac you like to be a trend-setter but sometimes the old ways are still best.
aries,What you hear this week may not be to your liking but there is no reason to overreact. The approaching full moon will have many people behaving in strange ways – you will be far from alone – so don’t be surprised if friends and family say and do silly things. ,aries,Your nerves may be on edge a little over the next 24 hours but don’t worry too much because nothing bad is likely to happen. Try not to change your everyday routine in any way, shape or form, as minor alterations could confuse you in major ways.
aries,There will be times over the next 24 hours when you have a hard time controlling your emotions. Be warned though: if you blow your top you may offend someone in a position of power. Whatever the issue, it’s not the end of the world, so calm down.
aries,You may not be able to explain how or why you have reached a decision but you must have the courage of your convictions and follow it through to the end. The more your rivals oppose you the more sure you can be that you’ve got it right. ,aries,Progress comes through taking chances and rejecting traditional ways of doing things. The more others try to persuade you that now is not the time to try something different, the more confident you can be it is the right time. ,aries,You want to feel that you are doing something useful with your life and with changes planet Uranus strong in your sign it is up to you to make something happen. Don’t do it alone though, do it with people who share your ideals.
aries,It’s not often you think deeply about what makes you tick but you will do so this weekend. You will be looking for answers to questions of the “who am I?” and “what does it all mean?” variety. The answers are inside your own mind.
aries,You don’t have to be a slave to your desires. You don’t have to act as if you have no choice in what you are doing. The fact is you always have a choice, so take responsibility for your actions and be a good example to other people. ,aries,What someone is offering you may seem like a good deal but is it really? The planets urge you to hold out for more because you are way above average in skill, commitment and intelligence. They need you more than you need them.
aries,There will be times over the next 24 hours when you have a hard time controlling your emotions. Be warned though: if you blow your top you may offend someone in a position of power. Whatever the issue, it’s not the end of the world, so calm down.
aries,Don’t tell friends and relatives what they want to hear today – tell them what they need to hear. A large dose of reality is essential and a no-nonsense Aries like you is the best person to administer it. They will thank you for it later.
aries,What occurs over the next 24 hours will give you a new perspective on what is important and what your long-term ambitions should be. Don’t hold on too tightly to what you have got – because what you are going to get will be so much better.
aries,An offer of some kind may seem attractive but don’t commit yourself too quickly. Take your time and consider all the pros and cons before deciding whether or not it is the right move for you. Opportunities are like buses – there will always be another one.
aries,You may not be in the most sociable of moods over the course of the weekend but that’s okay. Even an active, outgoing Aries such as yourself needs to spend time alone once in a while. Don’t cut yourself off completely though. Stay in touch.
aries,You are a rebel by nature and with your ruler Mars moving into your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius you are sure to do something outrageous. But don’t shock people every hour of every day or they will become used to it. Be selective.
aries,If you keep your eyes and ears open today you should see or hear something that gives you the chance to make a name for yourself. Don’t worry that you might look pushy, worry only that you might miss your chance if you hesitate.
aries,A friend desperately needs some reassurance and you are the one to provide it. A cheery word or two from you could be all it takes to pull them out of their mental and emotional nosedive and get them on the road to happiness again.
aries,You may be dreading what is round the next corner but there is no reason to worry – what you fear is mainly in your mind. Put your imagination to good use today and do something creative, something that could make you serious money. ,aries,Life may be a bit of a challenge at the moment but you can make things easier for yourself by not taking it too seriously. Look at the bigger picture: one hundred years from now what will any of it matter? Live in and for the day. ,aries,If you want to be successful you must be consistent. You may want to change things around a bit today but you must either move in a new direction and stay moving in that direction, or resist the temptation altogether. You don’t HAVE to change.
aries,If there is something you don’t want the world to know about then make a special effort to keep your mouth shut this weekend! Even if you are talking about something unrelated you could still let slip potentially embarrassing information.
aries,You have to accept that you won’t be able to have everything your own way over the coming week. If others want to call the shots the best thing you can do is to let them. In the long-term it simply does not matter. Go with the flow.
aries,The evidence has been there for quite some time that someone is trying to undermine your efforts, but you decided to ignore it because you did not want to rock the boat. Now though you have no choice. They cannot be allowed to continue bad-mouthing you.
aries,You need to confront something that both scares and excites you. Old fears and desires are likely to return over the next 24 hours and you will have to fight an emotional battle you thought was over and done with. Win it and end it this time.
aries,You are beginning to realize that your fears were unfounded and when the Sun moves into your sign at the weekend you will wonder how you allowed yourself to get so worked up about nothing. Life is all about attitude. Always be positive. ,aries,Try not to get emotional about things over which you have no control. The state of the world may at times upset you but there is only so much you can do on your own. Use the talents you were born with to help those less fortunate. ,aries,The Sun moves into your birth sign at the weekend, so don’t worry if you are feeling a bit under the weather at the moment because you will soon be back to your best. All sorts of new opportunities will be coming your way – be ready for them. ,aries,Don’t worry about what happened yesterday or the day before because when the Sun moves into your sign tomorrow you can start again with a clean slate – and a clean conscience! One of the best times of the year is about to begin.
aries,There are so many things going right for you now that to be pessimistic would be a crime. Almost everything you turn your hand to over the next few days will go well, so don’t hold back: aim high both in your personal life and at work.
aries,Don’t listen to what others say can and cannot be done – rise above the limits that they have imposed on you. The Sun in your birth sign gives a huge boost to your confidence. Anything is possible if you want it enough. Believe it and do it.
aries,You want to take on the world. You want to prove you have what it takes. It’s great that you have so much confidence now but don’t go too far and start to believe that you cannot fail. That kind of thinking is asking for trouble. ,aries,Avoid going to extremes over the next 24 hours. Even if you start the day in a good mood the lunar eclipse warns that something will happen that annoys you intensely. Whatever the issue may be don’t let it get to you – it’s not worth the hassle. ,aries,You are entitled to express your opinions but don’t forget that it works both ways – others are entitled to speak their minds as well. If you are big enough to dish it out Aries you must be big enough to take it too. Are you? ,aries,This may be your time of year but that does not mean you can take risks as you please. With Saturn moving retrograde today if you take an unnecessary gamble it will most likely backfire. Both at home and at work, play it safe.
aries,You know it is time for a change but the fearful side of your nature is holding you back. You must overrule it this weekend and follow your instincts wherever they might take you. You cannot hold on to the past, nor should you want to.
aries,You will know which strings to pull to get others dancing to your tune this week. Mercury in your sign, allied to genius planet Uranus, gives you an uncanny knack of being able to tune in to others’ needs and desires. Use it to your benefit.
aries,With Mercury in your sign linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, today the slightest little thing could set you off. If you want to avoid emotional scenes you would be smart to steer clear of people whose very presence rubs you up the wrong way.
aries,You don’t lack for courage or confidence at the moment and that’s just as well, because rivals and competitors will be looking for ways to put one over on you. If someone says they support you, make sure they back up their words with deeds. ,aries,No way are you content to sit back and let life come to you. On the contrary, you will be at the forefront of the action today and won’t stop until you collapse from exhaustion. Get your strength back tomorrow because the weekend will be busy too.
aries,There may be a noticeable increase in tension in a relationship today but don’t read too much into it. When loved ones get moody for no reason there is not a lot you can do about it, but neither is there any good reason to worry about it. ,aries,What seemed so important to you earlier in the week is now shown to be of no importance at all. Which begs the question: how many other things in your life that you worry about are worth the effort? None at all, most likely. ,aries,You will get a major boost early in the week when Venus moves into your sign. Most likely it will make you realize how fortunate you have been to have so many good people on your side in recent weeks. What can you do for them in return?,aries,You are fearing the worst for no good reason. Fortunately, when Venus moves into your sign tomorrow your mood will improve considerably. Today though you should find a quiet place where you can be on your own for a while. Spend time with your thoughts. ,aries,Venus moves into your sign today, making it easy for you to look at life from a more positive perspective. And that, of course, is the key: it is the way you think about life that determines the life that you get to lead.
aries,Authority figures will be hard to please today: no matter what you do and no matter how well you do it they will find reasons to complain. Most likely they are looking for a fight – so be smart and refuse to rise to the bait.
aries,Do something out of the ordinary today, something that marks you as a true individual, not just another clone. The last thing you want is to be thought of as the same as everyone else, so go out of your way to show that you are special. ,aries,You may get a bit emotional today, even if you are the kind of Aries who usually keeps your feelings under control. It’s probably no bad thing if you go over the top a little as it will clear the cobwebs away – but, please, only a little!,aries,Forget about your chores and focus on what means most to you: your family, your friends, your social life and, above all, your creative ambitions. Uranus in your sign makes you hugely adventurous. You won’t find it hard to be amazing.
aries,The Sun in your sign makes this a good time for you but it could be a great time if you know what it is you want and have a plan as to how you can get it. Identify your goal and dedicate your life to making it happen.
aries,You will be even more persuasive than usual over the next few days. Friends and rivals alike will be seduced by your way with words. Just make sure that you can deliver on any promises you make – better still, don’t make them at all.
aries,You have had enough of a situation that has caused so many sleepless nights and now you intend to do something about it. Whatever that something is make sure it is dynamic and decisive. And next time, don’t let bad things drag on so long.
aries,All things are possible for those who dare. Don’t think about the consequences of what you are planning to do today, just get on and do it and let the chips fall where they will. If you hold back now you are sure to regret it later. ,aries,Let other people make decisions for you over the next 24 hours. The planets indicate that your home life and family relationships will bring a lot of joy, but you need to relax and not try to do everything for everyone all the time.
aries,A problem you have been struggling with for some time does not appear to be any closer to an answer but don’t worry about it. Come the start of next week you will see with a flash of inspiration what needs to be done. There’s still time.
aries,You may be tempted to give up on something that isn’t going right but you really should hang on a bit longer. The reason fate is confronting you with such a challenging situation is because you are supposed to get stronger by overcoming it. ,aries,You are beginning to suspect that if a project of some kind cannot be completed soon then it might be best to forget about it. Your priorities will change dramatically when the Sun leaves your sign on Tuesday, so be flexible in all things.
aries,The Sun moves out of your birth sign tomorrow but before that happens you will be rewarded in some way for all the effort you have put in over the past few weeks. A new chapter is beginning and it will be a lot of fun.
aries,The momentum you have built up in recent weeks will keep you going even though the Sun leaves your birth sign today. You will, however, have to streamline or change your plans eventually. Make what you own and earn your number one priority.
aries,Can you be sure you are being dealt with fairly? According to the planets there is a very good chance that someone is trying to cheat you, or at the very least bluff you, so take nothing you see or hear at face value today.
aries,You have achieved so much in recent weeks but it is only the beginning: now you must push yourself still further and make sure all that hard work does not go to waste. But be realistic about your goals – even an Aries has limits! ,aries,Don’t be afraid to speak your mind today but be aware that your words are unlikely to be taken with good grace by those you criticize. And don’t worry if the powers that be get upset – in fact the more you annoy them the better!,aries,You may wish you were some place else entirely this weekend but the fact is you are where you are, so accept it and get on with what needs to be done. A few days from now you will understand why your options were limited. ,aries,Put money matters first today and keep them first throughout the coming week. If you let your financial situation get any worse you could find you have to start selling things to make ends meet, and that won’t be good for your Aries ego. ,aries,Disagreements may be inevitable over the next few days but losing friends because of them is not. In the greater scheme of things none of it really matters and you won’t be less of a winner if you let others get the better of you occasionally. ,aries,You are determined to put into action some of the big – some might say outrageous – ideas you’ve come up with in recent weeks. Certain people may not approve of your aims but annoying them is of course half the fun – and you do it so well! ,aries,According to the planets you have been fooling yourself about what a loved one or relative is up to but what happens today will leave you in no doubt about what they’ve been doing – and how you need to react. Be decisive, but be forgiving too.
aries,You may not want to turn away someone who needs your assistance but the fact is you are snowed under with work at the moment and if you take on any more responsibilities it could all go wrong. Learn to say “no” – and mean it.
aries,You don’t seem much concerned with the world at large at the moment, preferring the company of your own thoughts, and that’s okay. But don’t take it to extremes and ignore issues that could impact your earning power. Remember: money never sleeps.
aries,You seem to be on alert 24 hours a day at the moment, almost as if you are waiting for something to go wrong. The good news is that you are about to rediscover the fun side of life and stop worrying so much. What will be, will be.
aries,You may be tempted to get involved in a dispute between two of your friends but if you do they will most likely throw your advice back in your face. This looks like one of those occasions when it is best to stay out of the way.
aries,The Sun’s journey through the money area of your chart means you can expect good news concerning your earning power over the coming week. There is a definite luck factor working in your life at the moment. Make use of it.
aries,Although your money situation may have given you cause for concern of late today’s Sun-Jupiter link will help you see it is of no real importance. Being rich or poor is not about how much cash you have – it’s more a state of mind. ,aries,The planets warn you could easily go too far or say too much today, so be careful. Employers and other important people know what you can do and what your views are – you don’t have to act outrageously just to get noticed.
aries,Don’t give rivals an opportunity to make things difficult for you. Today’s Sun-Saturn link warns that someone is envious of your success and will make you look bad if they get the chance. They will only get that chance if you are sloppy. ,aries,If you are in any way dissatisfied with your lot then do something about it. Today’s new moon will give you the chance to show what you can do, but the effort must come from you. Think of the glory, and the money – and do it!,aries,No matter how much pressure you find yourself under this weekend you must not give in. Face each challenge as it arises and always believe you have what it takes to deal with any difficulty. Success is largely a state of mind.
aries,You need to make a major decision about your work but you also need to know all the facts before you move ahead. Be patient too because what happens over the next few days should point you in the right direction. The wait will be worth it.
aries,Don’t worry too much if you slip behind in your schedule a bit today. This is one of those occasions when you have to accept that you cannot always be on top of things. Relax, kick off your shoes and put your feet up. It’s only work!,aries,You will learn something to your advantage today, something that could boost your earning power. Others may say it is wrong to take advantage of information that was not meant for you but they would do the same if they were in your place. ,aries,No one will grant you the freedom to come and go as you please – you must seize it for yourself as if it is your right. Saturn, the taskmaster of the zodiac, is urging you to take control of your life – or, more likely, take back control. ,aries,Let fate guide you in the right direction today. The more you try to direct each and every thing that happens in your life the more you will realize just how little control you have. Strangely, you will do better if you do less. ,aries,If you give others the impression that you are anxious about something they may begin to lose faith in you, so make a point of looking confident even if you don’t feel it. Fortunately, you can be a good actor when you put your mind to it.
aries,Indulge yourself if you feel like it this weekend. Spend some money to make yourself feel good. You deserve a treat after all the efforts you have made in recent weeks but if you wait for someone else to spoil you then you could wait forever.
aries,Be on your guard over the next few days, especially if someone offers you something for nothing. Yes, of course, it’s possible they want to give it to you purely out of the generosity of their heart – but, seriously, how likely is that? ,aries,All the hard work you have done in recent weeks could quickly come undone if you allow yourself to get too aggressive. Don’t give the impression that you are looking for a fight or others will keep you at arm’s length. The world is not your enemy.
aries,Anyone who thinks they can root around in your personal affairs without your permission and get away with it obviously does not know you too well. You are not in the mood to put up with busybodies, especially when they are stupid as well. ,aries,You will get a chance to boost your earnings over the next few days, most likely in a way you could not have imagined or predicted. That’s good, because you are going to need every cent you can get your hands on. There are bills to pay.
aries,The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will bring the fun back into your life. You will be the life and soul of the party again and will also be thinking of taking a vacation. Yes, it’s all good – but you don’t have to do it all at once.
aries,The Sun’s entry into the most outgoing area of your chart today will get you back in the swing of things socially. Don’t worry about the cost, just take the first invitation that comes your way. You desperately need some fun in your life.
aries,It’s time for a change. It’s time to leave the old ways behind and do something new and exciting. Whatever has been holding you back in recent weeks is no longer a factor, so be brave and step into the unknown, taking giant strides!,aries,Mars, your ruler, in Sagittarius makes you somewhat reckless but there is a danger that you will go too far, even by your standards, and take the kind of risks that are foolish in the extreme. Just this once it might be wiser to play safe. ,aries,Get the week off to a perfect start by letting that special someone in your life know how much you care for them. The words will come easy and, more to the point, you will sound sincere as well. Don’t be afraid to say “I love you”.
aries,What others expect of you is of no consequence, either in your personal life or at work. The only thing that matters now is that you go out and have a good time with your friends. One particular friendship could quickly grow into love.
aries,Just because other people go to extremes does not mean you must follow their example. On the contrary, you will do your reputation a considerable amount of good today if you stick to the middle ground. Just this once, don’t take sides.
aries,You will do something silly today – you just can’t help yourself. But that’s okay, in fact it could even be to your benefit. You have been far too serious for far too long, so it may do you good to make a bit of a fool of yourself. ,aries,As your ruler Mars moves back into one of the more secretive areas of your chart today it would be easy to believe that someone has been keeping things from you or is talking behind your back. Maybe they are, but don’t tie yourself in knots about it. ,aries,Call it as you see it this weekend and don’t worry that some people might take it the wrong way. You don’t have time to worry about their feelings – you have too many important things to get done and time is running out. ,aries,You are not the sort to put up with restrictions and this week you will be even more determined to throw off whatever limits and boundaries have been holding you back. And free yourself from all that emotional baggage you have been carrying around.
aries,You will be an inspiration to other people this week. You may not realize it but they look up to you as the kind of person who gets things done, who has total self-belief. It may not be entirely true but it’s nice to be noticed. ,aries,Do you believe in yourself? Do you have faith in the talents you were born with? What you most need to remember now is that you are who you are for a reason and there is no need to feel bad about it. Be true to your nature. ,aries,Can you tell fact from fiction? Let’s hope so because if your powers of discrimination are not as good as you thought they were it could cost you dear. You don’t have to be overly suspicious but make sure you know where others are leading you.
aries,The most important thing today is that you refuse to allow yourself to be distracted by insignificant issues. There may be all sorts of interesting stuff going on around you but you must block it from your mind and stick to the task at hand.
aries,If you listen to what friends and work colleagues tell you today then you are sure to learn something to your advantage. Don’t be too proud to take advice because not even an Aries can know it all. Learn from other people’s mistakes.
aries,If you listen to what friends and work colleagues tell you today then you are sure to learn something to your advantage. Don’t be too proud to take advice because not even an Aries can know it all. Learn from other people’s mistakes.
aries,You won’t lack for ideas this week but you must be selective in what you choose to spend your time and eergy on. One particular insight or inspiration will stand out from the rest and that is the one you must focus on. It could make you famous.
aries,There may be an element of risk accepting an offer from a stranger, but what fun would life be without taking a few chances? Aries is an adventurous sign: it’s what keeps you mentally and emotionally young while others grow old before their time.
aries,Keep telling yourself that there are no barriers, that you can do what you want and when you want. Most of the obstacles you face exist only in your own mind. Nothing is impossible: if you desire something enough you will find a way to get it.
aries,Try not to get involved in petty disputes today or tomorrow. With communications planet Mercury opposing Mars, your ruler, quarrels will seem to creep up on you out of nowhere. Whatever the cause, it isn’t worth the time or the energy.
aries,You will have to deal with someone whose opinions you don’t much like today but as you are going to need their support in the future you must hold your nose and get on with it. Think of the greater good – your greater good, that is. ,aries,As an ideas person you are always ready to try new approaches and that willingness to improvise will serve you well today. While others are doing the same old things in the same old ways you will be doing something completely different – and brilliant. ,aries,You are taking an issue of some kind far too seriously and need to change the way you look at it. Remind yourself that, in the greater scheme of things, life is primarily about learning, so enjoy your experiences and, where possible, grow from them.
aries,Mercury, planet of communication, moves in your favor this week, which among other things means you will be even more outspoken than usual. Someone who wants to know your views, on just about anything, may get more than they bargained for. ,aries,You are in the mood to do something out of the ordinary, maybe even outrageous, and if you don’t shake things up in a major fashion over the coming seven days you will consider yourself a failure. Go on, make some waves!,aries,Anything is possible for you now – you know within your heart of hearts that there are no limits to what you can accomplish. Today’s Sun-Uranus link will inspire you to take chances and push beyond the limits society has imposed on you. ,aries,You may be willing to do anything to escape a situation you find too restrictive but don’t be too eager. Things may be bad now but they could be a lot worse, and will be if you let your Aries impatience get the better of you. ,aries,Whatever happens over the next few days, be it good, bad or indifferent, you will handle it with a great deal of flair. This is an especially good time to make decisions concerning your career and material possessions. Let your intuition guide you. ,aries,Partnership matters of all kinds will go much better as from today. They will go better still if you make a conscious effort to let go of grudges and forgive those who have let you down in some way. That applies especially to family feuds.
aries,The planets are warning loud and clear that your mind is playing tricks on you. Neptune, planet of inspiration but also illusion, is blurring the line between fact and fantasy, so think before you act and make sure your thoughts are clear.
aries,You will be even more of a go-getter than usual over the next few days. The only danger is you may come on a bit too strong and scare people away. Sometimes you don’t realize just how powerful a personality you can be.
aries,Don’t jump to conclusions today because the full moon warns you could be very wrong indeed. Steer clear of negative thoughts as well because they could be self-fulfilling. Never forget it’s your mind that creates the reality you live in.
aries,Take your foot off the gas today and take life at a more enjoyable pace. You may think you have to work twice as hard and move twice as fast as everyone else but you will get more done in the long-term if you let life come to you. ,aries,There is no point making a big fuss if little things go wrong. Strive to stay calm and don’t get annoyed over what are really quite trivial matters. Yes, certain people may be a pain at times but you should be used to it by now. ,aries,If there are any family issues that need to be resolved then now is the time. No matter how difficult the situation might be the Sun in the domestic area of your chart will make it easy for you to work things out to everyone’s satisfaction. ,aries,If there is something you can do for someone you love today then do it and don’t count the cost. Besides, you should know by now that when you do a good deed for others it always, eventually, somehow comes back to you.
aries,There will never be a better, or easier, time to change the habits of a lifetime. A powerhouse Jupiter-Pluto link this weekend means you can shake up your life a little or a lot – it is entirely up to you. Go all the way and make it a lot.
aries,Over the coming week you will find out once and for all if you have what it takes to succeed at the highest level. You will improve your chances a great deal if you stop seeing certain people as deadly rivals and start seeing them as allies.
aries,With the domestic area of your chart so prominent at the moment family feuds are more likely than not. But now that you know that you can limit the chances of a serious falling-out by being careful what you say. It is possible! ,aries,There is no point making a fuss about something you do not have the power to change. Also, if you let others see how much it is annoying you they will do it even more just to be spiteful, so pretend you don’t have a care in the world.
aries,There is no point trying to force other people to see things your way because it isn’t going to happen. Fortunately, with Mars, your ruler, moving in your favor today it does not matter if others disagree with you. Your word is law anyway. ,aries,When you are bored you have a tendency to get wild but if you go over the top in any way today you could end up in all sorts of trouble. If you must do something silly make it something that won’t make others mad at you.
aries,Avoid making threats today because they won’t be taken seriously. For some reason your credibility is low at the moment, especially on the work front where colleagues and employers seem to believe you are all talk and no action. Prove them wrong.
aries,You will say something this weekend that ruffles a few feathers. Looking back you may wish you had kept your thoughts to yourself but the fact is you’re an Aries and opening your mouth and putting both feet in it is par for the course. ,aries,Later in the month the Sun will move in your favor again and your confidence will soar. Over the next few days, however, you must focus your attention on your domestic situation. What can you do to make family relationships more serene? ,aries,Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart will reach critical mass over the next few days, so you should expect major changes. Family members are sure to rub you up the wrong way but don’t lose your temper – it’s not worth the effort.
aries,What you are being offered may seem generous but it’s not be as good as it could be, so hold back a while and see if you can get more. You are way above average in both skill and commitment, so make sure you get extra. ,aries,At last you are getting along with someone you have not always seen eye-to-eye with in the past. If they make an effort to be nice to you today you must make an effort to be nice to them in return. Despite your doubts, you can be friends.
aries,You will need to compromise today. You will need to actively search for common ground. If you insist on getting your own way it will cause more problems than it solves. If you have to give something now you will get it back again later. ,aries,Let loved ones make their own decisions today. They may, of course, discover that they don’t need your help at all, but more likely they will realize just how lost they are without your assistance. It’s good to remind them how important you are.
aries,You know what it is that is expected of you and you know you don’t have any choice in the matter, so get on and do it to the best of your abilities. At this time of year especially your own needs and desires sometimes have to come second.
aries,You will find it easier to come and go as you please over the next few days. Not everyone will be pleased with your new found sense of freedom but that’s too bad. Go where you want to go and don’t let fear of disapproval hold you back.
aries,There should be an easing of restrictions, especially financial restrictions, this week. But, of course, that is not an excuse to go on a spree. If you do you will regret it later when you are handed a much bigger bill than you expected.
aries,Try not to make life more complicated than it needs to be. You will sail through the next few days without a care in the world, so kick off your shoes, sit back and enjoy the passing parade. You will be leading your own parade very soon.
aries,It may seem as if others are ganging up on you for no good reason, but in fact they are ganging up on you for a very good reason. As an Aries you sometimes do things without realising how provocative they can be. So what have you done now? ,aries,A busy time begins for you today as Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into the most dynamic area of your chart. There will be times when you move so fast mentally that your body finds it hard to keep up. But you’ll manage. Speed is your thing.
aries,If a colleague lets you down by dropping out of a joint project you won’t be happy about it. But don’t let it bother you too much because you can quite easily finish it on your own – and you won’t have to share the applause!,aries,The Sun linked to both Uranus and Mars, your ruler, this weekend means you won’t be in the least bit hesitant. You will throw yourself at whatever, or whoever, it is you wish to conquer and achieve what some say is impossible. Not for you it’s not! ,aries,Sometimes even an Aries has to come second or third – seriously you cannot possibly win all the time. The approaching full moon warns that in one area at least you will have no option but to concede defeat. It’s no big deal. You’ll get over it.
aries,It may annoy you that certain people have still not managed to get their act together, but it may be a blessing in disguise. Over the next few days you will get the chance to go back and double check the details on which your plans depend.
aries,It will be easy to jump to conclusions today – and most likely they will be wrong. Wait until later in the week before deciding if a friend or colleague has let you down, because only then will you be able to see the situation from all sides.
aries,Whatever you turn your hand to over the next 24 hours will work out better than you expected. One of your strengths is that you are always willing to give something a go – especially when the cynics and critics tell you it cannot be done. ,aries,Sometimes your standards can be way too high, but when the Sun changes signs tomorrow you will find it easier to let go of unrealistic expectations, both of yourself and of other people. Forget about going higher or faster – be yourself and be happy. ,aries,It is time to set yourself a new challenge. Commit yourself to a goal that others say is beyond your reach. With the Sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you will take great delight in proving to the doubters wrong. ,aries,There is no need to be cautious Aries. Others can worry about taking risks if they so wish but this is your time of year and you intend to make the most of it. The Sun in Leo will protect you, even when you push your luck too far.
aries,You need to stop complaining and start looking for solutions. The Sun in Leo means you are more likely to find them if you get creative and take a few risks. Also, get some input from friends and colleagues. They’re smarter than you think.
aries,Someone will try to provoke you today and you will find it hard not to react. Chances are, of course, that is exactly what they are hoping you will do because it will give them the excuse they need to punish you. Don’t fall into their trap.
aries,You don’t seem to be short of admirers at the moment – in fact you have rarely been so popular. But you cannot accept each and every social invitation that comes your way, not unless you want to exhaust yourself. Be selective in your partying.
aries,Try not to spread yourself too thin today. No matter how hard you are able to push yourself if you take on too much over the next 24 hours you are sure to regret it. Focus only on those things that have to be done – the rest can wait. ,aries,Try not to let other people’s cautious ways hold you back. Aries is an adventurous sign and you enjoy taking the kind of risks that less daring souls try to avoid. You never know what tomorrow might bring, so do what feels right today. ,aries,With changes planet Uranus turning retrograde in your sign today it’s unlikely you will be able to focus on any one thing for more than a few minutes, so don’t start anything too detailed. Big changes are coming, changes you will approve of. ,aries,You will quickly rebound from whatever shock the weekend brought your way and in a matter of days you will be back to your best. You have a great deal of energy at your disposal but don’t waste it on things, or people, of no real importance.
aries,You will quickly rebound from whatever shock the weekend brought your way and in a matter of days you will be back to your best. You have a great deal of energy at your disposal but don’t waste it on things, or people, of no real importance.
aries,It does not matter what feuds you had with certain people in the past – what matters now is that you work together. You cannot change the world on your own but you can do a lot of good if you join forces with those who share your ideals.
aries,If you bring what you are working on to a conclusion over the next 24 hours everyone will hail it as a resounding success. And you will have every right to bask in their praise, because it was your talent and your self-belief that made it work.
aries,As Mars, your ruler, is now moving in your favor it won’t be long before you find a new sense of direction and a new motivation. Don’t let minor doubts and fears hold you back the way they did before. Believe in yourself and in your dreams. ,aries,You must not allow yourself to be seduced by people whose way with words is their major skill. Almost inevitably it will lead to a loss of some sort and you will be the one who has to pay up. Listen to your inner voice only. ,aries,You always seem to be on the go but even an Aries needs to slow down once in a while and cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart invites you to relax today and over the weekend. You will feel the benefits in the long-term.
aries,You can at times be unforgiving but you will go right the other way this weekend and give up on some kind of grudge. That’s good, both for them and for you. No matter how much they may have displeased you it’s time to move on.
aries,If you want to move up in the world then who you know will be as important as what you know. This is the ideal time to approach and make friends with people who may be of use to you on the work front or financially.
aries,The more you rush here, there and everywhere this week the less you will get done. You have made too many plans and taken on too many commitments. Like it or not you will have to let some people down over the next few days.
aries,Your ambitions may have been frustrated in recent weeks but you will enjoy no end of success over the next few days. The universe will reward you for your efforts and your determination not to give up. No one can deny it is fully deserved.
aries,You have every right to speak your mind no matter how taboo the topic of discussion may be. Those who try to stop you clearly have something to hide, something they don’t want the world to know about. Find out what it is.
aries,Try not to let your feelings get in the way of what you have to do. The fact is you have made a mistake and need to own up to it. It’s no big deal – despite what some people may say to the contrary you are only human.
aries,You must not allow your emotions to get in the way of logical thinking today. The planets warn if you let your feelings get the better of you it will cause more than a few problems later on, especially if those feelings are of a negative nature. ,aries,This is still a great time of the year for you and it will be even better if you stop worrying about money matters and have a good time. Just remember that your definition of a good time may not be the same as other people’s.
aries,Generally speaking you don’t much care if others disapprove of what you are doing but now it will pay you to make an effort to win others round to your way of thinking. Don’t rub people up the wrong way just for the fun of it. ,aries,The planets warn that someone could be setting you up for some kind of scam, so be on your guard. The more they promise you the less likely it is they plan to deliver. You’re not usually the gullible type, but watch out!,aries,The sky is the limit today. A magnificent Sun-Uranus link gives you supreme self-confidence, to the extent that you honestly believe that all things are possible. You may find by the end of the day that even the sky is not high enough.
aries,If you receive some kind of offer today you must find out exactly what it entails and what will be expected of you in return. Most likely the cost will be worth it but you don’t want any nasty surprises a bit further down the line. ,aries,Try not to complain if what you get today is not what you wanted because it will make important people think you are ungrateful. Thank them for what they have done for you and, if possible, give something in return. It’s good public relations.
aries,No matter how strong your opinions on a certain subject may be you must keep them to yourself today. If you go too far – and you know you will – you will make an enemy of someone it might have been wiser to keep as a friend.
aries,Be yourself this weekend. Go your own way and do your own thing and don’t worry in the slightest that people may not approve. Make the most of the Sun’s final two days in the most dynamic area of your chart to stir things up a little.
aries,The next few days will require a lot of hard work on your part, and also a lot of self-control, but if you keep your cool and keep a smile on your face you will come through unscathed and maybe even with your reputation enhanced.
aries,Your head may be full of wonderful ideas but what are you going to do with them? Confidence is a trait you have never lacked but it will take more than self-belief to turn those big ideas into concrete realities. It will take commitment too.
aries,Your big ideas won’t come to much unless you plan well ahead. Like most Aries you no doubt prefer to leave the boring details to other people but the planets warn if you do that now there could be trouble. Take a little time to get it right.
aries,Social activities and travel arrangements are well starred today but you must not take anything for granted. Make sure you know where you are going, and who you are going with, before you start out so there are no nasty surprises.
aries,There is a danger now that you will let people get away with things they do not deserve to get away with, which could cause problems later on when there are more serious issues to be resolved. Don’t be too forgiving, not even with friends and loved ones.
aries,Sometimes it is better to smash through obstacles rather than find a way around them and that is likely to be the best approach today. Mars, your ruler, endows you not only with the energy but with ambition too. Sometimes it’s okay to be ruthless.
aries,You will want to prove yourself in some way this weekend. But don’t take on too much because you might regret it later when you try to move on to something new but cannot because you still have obligations to fulfil. Don’t get carried away.
aries,Everyone has limits, even an Aries, but things have been going so well for you of late that you may have forgotten what they are. Don’t get annoyed if a friend or relative tells you to cool it a little. They are only trying to help.
aries,At some stage over the next few days you will come to the conclusion that life is too short to waste time on fights and feuds. Contact those you have not been on good terms with and let them know you want to be friends again – and mean it.
aries,If you have fallen out with someone you care for now is the time to get things back to how they used to be. As love planet Venus moves into the relationship area of your chart today no one will be able to resist your charm.
aries,The time has come to assess your priorities and decide what is worth putting your time and energy into and what must be cut out of your life. There are only 24 hours in a day and they must only be used for what truly matters. ,aries,If there are any minor chores that need to be completed then now is the time. A solar eclipse in the work area of your chart will make it easy for you to knuckle down and get boring stuff out of the way once and for all. ,aries,You may have been working hard to no obvious end but soon you will see the fruits of your labors. You will also find it easier to work alongside people who have been difficult to talk to of late. You should be on the same wavelength now.
aries,Try not to be so intense about work and business issues this weekend. You know there are more important things in life but it can be hard to remember that when you are up to your neck in deals and negotiations. Find time to relax and unwind.
aries,Just because things have been done a certain way in the past does not mean they have to be done that way in the future. Some people, of course, are set in their ways and will need persuading that it’s time for a change. Persuade, don’t force. ,aries,You have been pushing yourself hard in recent days and although for the most part your energy has kept you going you will reach a point this week when you have no choice but to slow down. You don’t have to do it all you know!,aries,No matter how active an Aries you may be you cannot possibly keep up your present crazy pace for much longer. Cosmic activity in the health area of your chart urges you to slow down before you fall down. Take a break now and again. ,aries,What happens over the next 24 hours will remind you that fear is a thoroughly negative emotion and serves no useful purpose at all. The planets urge you to seek out what scares you the most and fight it until you fear it no more. ,aries,There are some powerful feelings at work at the moment and jealousy is likely to rear its ugly head as some stage today. You may not be directly involved but watch out you don’t get caught in the middle – because then you will get it from both sides. ,aries,Over the next few weeks you will be confronted with situations where you have no choice but to compromise, but the good news is it will come easy to you. Deep down you know you won’t get far in life without other people. ,aries,You will have to be strong this weekend, especially when dealing with people who think they have a right to give orders. By all means be helpful if you can but don’t let them take advantage of you. Once they start they will never stop.
aries,Someone you meet socially over the next few days will have a huge effect on your aims and ambitions. More importantly they will open your mind to new possibilities and help you to see that your horizons have so far been needlessly limited.
aries,If you have been driving yourself hard of late now would be a good time to slow down a bit and catch your breath. The approaching eclipse may tempt you to take on an even heavier workload but that is really not a good idea.
aries,You may be under a certain amount of stress at the moment but being an Aries you will try to work your way through it. Be careful though. Today’s Sun-Mars link warns if you push yourself too hard you could do yourself some serious damage.
aries,Steer clear of trivial things and trivial people over the next few days. You cannot allow petty matters to distract you from what needs to be done, not least because your health may not be as robust as it usually is. It’s time to get serious. ,aries,It seems you have been avoiding the truth for quite some time in the hope that it might just go away, but now you can see that it won’t you will be roused into action. To start with your working routine needs to be drastically changed. ,aries,In both your personal life and at work you will discover that the more you go out of your way to be nice to people the more they will go out of their way to be nice to you. It’s something you probably should have noticed before.
aries,Is there something you desire so much that you would do almost anything to get it? If so you will get the chance to make your dream come true this week, but it may cost you in ways you had not expected, so be cautious. ,aries,You may find it hard to get along with someone who likes to do things their own way but like it or not you are going to have to work with them. The planets indicate you will get along better than you expected, and make some money too.
aries,Not everyone appreciates your opinions – which often sound like criticisms – so think before you speak and make sure your words are not hurtful. If you say the wrong thing today you could turn a friend against you, and that would be a shame. ,aries,Anything of a partnership nature, be it personal, professional or financial, can be changed for the better quite easily now. A new romantic relationship is possible over the next few days too but first try looking for ways to spice up an existing affair. ,aries,You may be a bit touchy today, especially where matters to do with money and possessions are concerned. Generally though the cosmic picture is still positive, so most likely you have little to worry about. Stop fretting about problems that don’t actually exist. ,aries,People will be rather demanding this weekend, and over the next few weeks while the Sun moves through your opposite sign of Libra. It does not, of course, mean they have the right to treat you like a door mat. Make sure they know that. ,aries,Career issues will start going well for you again over the next few days, so push yourself forward and make sure important people know who you are and what you can do. They know already, of course, but it won’t hurt to remind them.
aries,With both Jupiter and Pluto working in your favor as the week begins it would appear that you are under divine protection. There will still be challenges, of course, but now your self-belief has returned you won’t hesitate to tackle them head-on.
aries,As Mars moves into the career area of your chart today your belief in what you are doing with your life will be renewed. Find ways to let employers and people in positions of power know you are ready to take on more responsibility.
aries,If you go out of your way to help people today they will go out of their way to help you later on and, on balance, you will gain more than you lose. Not that winning and losing has much to do with helping those in need, of course.
aries,With Mars, your ruler, highlighting the career area of your chart at the moment your ambition and your will to win will gain you many admirers. Some though will see you as a threat, so do your best to make sure colleagues benefit too. ,aries,You appear to be ready to throw in your hand and admit defeat, which is not like you at all Aries. The cosmic powers that be advise you to sit tight and see what tomorrow’s new moon brings before making a final decision.
aries,Forget about details and forget about doing the right thing. This weekend you should have only one aim in mind: to have as much fun as possible. For those born under the sign of Aries there are no limits, so deny yourself nothing and enjoy everything.
aries,If you need help you must ask for it. The Sun in your opposite sign means there is only so far you can get under your own steam but if you join with people whose interests mirror your own you can accomplish great things together.
aries,Yes, some people are being selfish, but there is no point getting worked up about it. The more they get on your nerves the more you must stay calm. The more they do things that annoy you the more you should pretend it does not bother you.
aries,The reason you are not making progress in a particular direction is because, deep down, you know it is not the right thing for you. Maybe you should stop longing for all those things you cannot have and focus on what you already possess.
aries,You need to make up your mind about something and you need to do so quickly. Today’s Mars-Jupiter link means if you don’t get your act together soon the matter will be taken out of your hands – and you must not let that happen. ,aries,The most important thing now is that you obey the rules. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign warns if you stray from the straight and narrow over the next two or three days someone will be waiting to pounce and make you look bad. ,aries,Try to avoid getting caught up in power struggles and office politics today. So many things are going well for you now that you can afford to ignore what others people are up to. Keep doing what you are doing and keep doing it well. ,aries,People will want to get close to you this weekend and you will enjoy being the center of attention. Why are you suddenly flavor of the month? Who knows. Who cares. Enjoy it while you can – you know it’s unlikely to last!,aries,Aim to be more expressive over the coming week. There are so many good things – even great things – going on in your life at the moment that you should stand up and shout about them so the whole world knows how lucky you are. ,aries,Everyone else thinks you are a star, so why don’t you? Take a moment to step outside yourself today and see yourself through other people’s eyes. You may not be perfect but you gets things done, and in today’s world that’s a rare talent.
aries,Someone will offer you some excellent advice today but because it is not what you were hoping to hear you may decide to ignore it. Mistake! Don’t let your ego get in the way of the facts, especially where money matters are concerned. ,aries,If you want people to understand what you have to say then spell it out for them slowly and simply. Even then there is the possibility that what you say and what others hear will be two entirely different things. Make allowances for that. ,aries,If someone in a position of authority says something you disagree with today you may be tempted to make an issue of it, but is that wise? They have the power and are clearly eager to use it. Maybe you should just stay out of the way. ,aries,Someone will try to talk you into cashing in your winnings now but if your instincts tell you to wait a bit then you must not allow yourself to be rushed. The longer you leave it the greater your share of the pie will be. ,aries,Listen to and act on what your inner voice tells you. What other people say may be interesting but if you follow their advice you will regret it. The more they try to make plans for you the more you must insist they mind their own business.
aries,A full moon in your sign suggests you will act out of character this week – you may even make a bit of a fool of yourself. Fortunately, no one will think any the worse of you for it. Maybe you should play the fool more often Aries!,aries,Instead of blaming yourself for what other people say you’ve got wrong perhaps you should blame them for being too narrow in their thinking. Believe in yourself and in what you are doing this week. Whether or not others believe in it is irrelevant.
aries,You have a lot of energy at your disposal now and you want to use it to do something useful. There is a danger though that you will get carried away and run yourself into the ground, so don’t try to do everything at once. Pace yourself sensibly.
aries,Once the Sun moves into your opposite sign at the weekend you will find it easier to get along with loved ones and colleagues and they will find it easier to get along with you. Get rid of that fierce look on your face – you don’t need it!,aries,If you do not have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish then you will most likely fail. Forget about what other people may or may not expect of you – the only question that matters is: what do you expect of yourself?,aries,Before you criticize someone for their behavior today make sure they can’t turn round and point out that you have often done the same sort of thing yourself. ‘Do as I say, not as I do’ is not a philosophy that gets much respect. ,aries,You may be stuck in a rut and desperate to find a way out but this is not a good time to take risks, especially with money. The planets urge you to tighten your belt and learn to live with less for a while. You can do it!,aries,You will want to be left alone with your thoughts as the new week begins. Hopefully family and friends will see the signs and give you the space you need. You need to get your head right before tackling matters of a practical nature.
aries,Someone who has let you down may deserve to be read the riot act but the planets warn this is not a good time to give voice to your feelings. Bite your lip and save what you were going to say until later. It can wait.
aries,You will find it easy to make a good impression on people in positions of power and should take advantage of the situation to move up in the world. You will quite enjoy being thought of as someone special – but don’t let it go to your head. ,aries,Forget about money worries and start making plans for something big. The current cosmic climate will encourage you to pursue new opportunities and you must not let your cashflow situation hold you back. It’s not about money, it’s about courage. ,aries,Money may be important to you but you must not put it ahead of things such as love and having fun. Go out and have a good time today and don’t worry about what it will cost. You will find a way to pay – you always do. ,aries,With Mars and Uranus at loggerheads this weekend you must expect fireworks of one sort or another. If someone in a position of authority challenges you to up your game you must take up that challenge, no matter how unnecessary it appears to be.
aries,A feud that has been bubbling beneath the surface will erupt into the open this week. Don’t bother looking for a compromise solution because there isn’t one, it is all or nothing. You know you are in the right, so don’t back down.
aries,You may decide to do something drastic to get your career back on track but things done in haste are often repented at leisure, so be careful. Don’t let other people goad you into making changes you would not make if left to your own devices.
aries,If peace of mind is important to you then you must not allow yourself to get dragged into a situation that could cause you sleepless nights. No matter how much others promise you by way of reward it simply isn’t worth the aggravation.
aries,When the going gets tough the tough get going, or so they say. Can you motivate yourself to keep at it and show important people you have what it takes? Of course you can. The rewards on offer will make the effort worthwhile.
aries,There is no point arguing with someone in a position of power, because even if the facts are all on your side they will still refuse to see things your way – and there is nothing you can do about it. Stay out of their way if you can. ,aries,Avoid people who seem to enjoy making a drama out of a crisis. The best way to deal with upheavals, both at home and at work, is to stay calm, think things through and take the appropriate action. Don’t make life unnecessarily complicated.
aries,A lot can happen over a single weekend – and most likely will. Don’t bother making plans because whatever you decide is sure to be overtaken by events. Just be ready to act quickly and decisively when the opportunity arises to make a name for yourself.
aries,Don’t just latch on to the latest trend, start one of your own. The more those around you seem to be following the herd the more you must show your independent side. Aries is a cardinal sign, which means you were born to lead.
aries,Instead of trying to give up certain vices (and failing) try making a virtue of them and enjoying them as much as you can. Chances are you will eventually get so sick of what you are doing that you find giving up much easier. Give it a go.
aries,If everyone seems to be saying the same thing at the moment it will pay you to be a bit suspicious. According to the planets it could well be the case that what others say and what others mean are two entirely different things.
aries,Mars, your ruler, makes you extremely independent but sometimes your brain freezes and you find yourself stuck. There are so many possibilities available to you now that you may have to ask friends what you should do next. Listen, learn and act. ,aries,You may want to help those who have been less fortunate than you but you still need to remember there is only so much you can do alone. Join a like-minded group or movement that aims to make the world a better place.
aries,A clash over a money issue is likely today but don’t worry, you won’t end up out of pocket. If you are sure of your facts, and back them up with meaningful action, you may even come out of it with a healthy profit. ,aries,You may be hungry for success but you need to be cautious too. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the career area of your chart this weekend you will gain a lot more by being nice to people than by being ruthless with them.
aries,Tomorrow’s full moon highlights the financial axis of your chart and if you are tempted to spend money on things you don’t need you will probably regret it. The truly important things in life can still be had for free. ,aries,Wishful thinking can be dangerous and it is likely that you will go over the top with some of your ideas today. You may be desperate to succeed but you must also be realistic about what is and is not within your power to accomplish.
aries,It’s not like you to worry but the Sun in Scorpio these past few weeks has been playing on your fears. A week or so from now you will be your old self again: full of confidence and vitality. Between now and then try not to think too much.
aries,Be ready to compromise today – and be smart enough not to go too far. Let those you have fallen out with know they must meet you halfway if they are serious about ending your differences. If you give in too easily you will surely lose out. ,aries,You have the power to change things but you must not misuse it. What you should be thinking of now is not how to gain power over other people but how to gain power over those aspects of your personality that sometimes get you into trouble.
aries,Both your thoughts and your words will be clear and to the point today. If you need to sell an idea to someone in a position of power now is the time to speak up. Get straight down to the important stuff and they are sure to be impressed.
aries,You need to beware of imagining things that bear no relation to reality. Usually your confidence in yourself is so amazingly high that nothing much fazes you, but every now and then it hits a low note and doubts creep in. Don’t worry, it will pass. ,aries,You are ready for anything and when the Sun moves into the sympathetic sign of Sagittarius tomorrow there will no holding you back. For best results though you must pace yourself sensibly. If you take on too much too soon you could burn yourself out.
aries,The Sun moves into one of the best areas of your chart today and while it may take a few days for things to pick up once they do you will be on a roller-coaster ride of fun and games. Hold on tight and enjoy the ride.
aries,All you have to do now is snap your fingers and people will come running to do what you ask of them. Will you use this ability for good ends or bad? That remains to be seen but either way nothing will be denied you.
aries,Honesty is a must today, even if the things you say make you unpopular with certain people. Of course, it is not only the words that are important but also how you choose to deliver them. Be honest but try not to sound nasty too.
aries,You are not averse to taking risks, in fact it is one of the things that makes you feel most alive. Cosmic activity in your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius means the odds are very much on your side at the moment, so go for it!,aries,Try not to make a drama out of a crisis today. It will be all too easy to lose your sense of perspective and get angry about something that is really not worth the time or the trouble. Relax and tell yourself it’s just one of those things. ,aries,With Mercury, planet of communication, working in your favor this weekend you will find it easy to win friends and influence people. Don’t let your thoughts be constricted by the mental limits certain people try to impose on you. Always be original. ,aries,You will be asking a lot of big questions of yourself over the next few days. Whether or not you get any meaningful answers remains to be seen but you can no longer go on living as if nothing matters – when deep down you know everything does.
aries,You may not want to change course – you hate to admit that you made a wrong call – but what choice do you have? The stakes are so high now that you must do whatever is necessary to get out of the hole you have dug for yourself.
aries,Get past wishful thinking and start making your dreams come true. Today’s new moon will help you to identify your priorities and then stick to them – you won’t go off at a tangent as you have done so many times before. Success is guaranteed. ,aries,You would be wise not to make any major announcements today. You may be bursting to tell the world about what you are up to but you will get a better response if you leave it another 24 hours. Good news is always worth waiting for. ,aries,You have this vague feeling that you should be doing something useful with your life. If you have not yet been able to work out what that something is don’t worry, it will come to you over the next few days. It’s time to make a difference. ,aries,You don’t often listen to advice but what you are told by a friend this weekend could bring remarkable good fortune, so listen carefully and then find ways to put the information to good use. Don’t let your pride come between you and success. ,aries,The most important thing over the coming week is that you stay on the course you are already on. Others may try to persuade you to try something different and you are not averse to a bit of adventure but on this occasion you must stick with what you know. ,aries,If you are on the move today you can be sure that something surprising will happen, something that will test your ability to adapt to evolving circumstances. Be flexible and be ready to change your mind about something if you realize you are wrong.
aries,Why are you afraid to tell the world about your big idea? Is it because you fear what their reaction might be? That suggests, does it not, that you are not yet convinced that it’s as good as it could be. Give it a bit more thought today.
aries,Moderation is the key to success now, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. Pluto in the career area of your chart warns if you go too far or make claims or promises you cannot fulfill you could seriously damage your reputation.
aries,With Jupiter moving through your sign you will have no trouble getting the support of colleagues and loved ones. This is a great time for one-to-one relationships of all kinds, both personal and professional. Make the most of it while you can.
aries,Jupiter in the partnership area of your chart makes this a wonderful time for relationships, especially those of a romantic nature. Loved ones will go out of their way to make you feel good – and you should aim to do the same for them.
aries,Whatever else you do this weekend do NOT follow the crowd. Go your own way and do your own thing and laugh when certain individuals get annoyed at your antics. The world needs people like you who are not afraid to challenge the status quo.
aries,If you feel a bit under the weather this week take it as a sign that you are doing too much and need to rest both your body and your mind. Your energy and enthusiasm will return soon enough but for now don’t push yourself so hard.
aries,Today’s Sun-Uranus link will encourage you to be more open, outgoing and optimistic. Whatever you set your heart on between now and the end of the year you will find a way to get it. Life is good and about to get even better.
taurus,For some reason you appear reluctant to accept an offer of assistance from a friend or work colleague. According to the planets you are right to be suspicious, so listen to your sixth sense and do only what it tells you.
taurus,It may appear as if you are the only one making sacrifices for a relationship but the planets warn you are not seeing the situation clearly. Don’t start complaining or you may lose the one person who makes your world a better place.
taurus,You are being far too pessimistic about your chances. In all things there is a natural ebb and flow and if you are on the down side of the curve at the moment you are sure to be on the up again by the end of the week.
taurus,The only thing to fear is fear itself, so put your doubts behind you and plunge headlong into the unknown. That might not sound like a typically Taurus thing to do but, seriously, what have you got to lose? Take a chance.
taurus,What you focus your attention on today will seem more important than it really is, so make sure you focus on positive things. Your mind is a powerful tool and can create happiness as easily as it creates sadness. Remember that. ,taurus,Too often in the past you have held back while those with considerably less talent have achieved the kind of success that should have been yours. It’s time to shed your inhibitions and let the world see what a star you really are.
taurus,You won’t lack for confidence today but you may lack for common sense, so don’t push your luck too far. On the work front, especially, you need to be aware that certain people do not have your best interests at heart.
taurus,Keep your eye on money matters and business issues and make sure you are not being duped by people who would quite happily get rich at your expense. It would be nice if everyone was as honest as you but the fact is they’re not.
taurus,There is a lot of pressure on you at the moment, the sort that would make other people crack. But you’re not other people, you’re a Taurus, and giving in and giving up are not in your nature. What’s the worst that can happen? You can handle it.
taurus,Be careful what you say if someone comes to you for advice. Make sure what you tell them comes from your own experience and is not something you picked up from an unreliable source. If you don’t know the answer, just say so.
taurus,If you need to get something finished you had better step on the gas. Mars in the work area of your chart will boost your energy levels but you won’t get anywhere worth going unless you are motivated. Remind yourself what it’s all for.
taurus,It may at times seem as if you are not making much progress but in a matter of days there will be clear signs that you are on the verge of a major breakthrough. Keep looking ahead and keep doing what makes you feel good.
taurus,Expect your workload to increase a lot over the next 24 hours. That may not sound like good news but at least it shows that important people trust you to get the job done. Looks like you’re the only one they can rely on.
taurus,Don’t let your tendency to fear the worst get out of hand and spoil what otherwise promises to be a good weekend. If anxiety starts to bite just stop, count to ten, and remind yourself of all the things you have to be thankful for.
taurus,Your money situation looks worse than it really is, so resist the urge to make major changes. Yes, cutbacks of some kind will be necessary in the long-term but now is not the best time to start them as you are not thinking straight.
taurus,Speak up if you have something important to say but make sure you listen too because the feedback you get could be invaluable. Also, someone you meet on your travels will come up with an idea that you take to immediately,taurus,You may feel compelled to accept what is being offered but if you are not happy with the terms you must speak up or there will be trouble further down the line. You are not being selfish by holding out for more. Do what’s best for you.
taurus,You will have to do something that makes you unpopular but if you don’t do it now you may have to do something twice as bad later on. Put duty before pleasure and make sure you are on top of your workload.
taurus,You may resent having to pay for something you think you should get for free but if you make a scene you may end up paying even more. Don’t be such a miser. Put your hand in your pocket. It’s only money after all.
taurus,If you find yourself up against a tough opponent today you should back off and live to fight another day. The planets warn this is a battle you cannot win and if you cannot win then the only sensible course is to withdraw, for now.
taurus,This is a good time for affairs of the heart and if you are in the market for love you might just meet someone who floats your boat. However, the planets warn it won’t be all plain sailing, so be ready to brave a few storms.
taurus,Make quick work of any money matters or business issues that have to be dealt with, then turn your attention to having fun with your friends. Travel of one sort or another is on the cards over the next few weeks, so start packing.
taurus,This is a fortunate time of year for you, so why the feeling of impending doom? Whatever it is that is making you jittery put it out of your mind because it does not have the power to hurt you. Work is the best remedy for worry.
taurus,You will handle anything and everything life throws at you with grace and style. The planets endow you with limitless self-confidence and the kind of faith that moves mountains. Make the most of it – and make your mark on the world.
taurus,It will pay you to be skeptical about what you are told today, especially if the person who is doing the telling is a rival of some sort. The more they assure you there is nothing to worry about the more you should check for yourself.
taurus,You need a change of perspective and a change of direction and the planets will see that you get it. But don’t worry: you will like what the next few weeks bring your way very much indeed. Be positive and welcome new opportunities.
taurus,This promises to be a special day for you, even more so if you are socializing or traveling. It is also a good day to patch things up romantically. Whatever problems you had in the past put them behind you and move on.
taurus,You are about to be made an offer you won’t want to refuse but some individuals will go out of their way to persuade you that it’s not in your interests. Don’t listen to them. They are jealous because you are attracting so much good fortune.
taurus,The Sun in Capricorn gives your confidence a boost but confidence alone won’t get you where you want to go. The approaching new moon will remind you that no matter how determined you may be you still need powerful friends.
taurus,Something will happen today that others think is of mega-importance. You, however, can see the situation for what it truly is: just another minor drama in a long line of minor dramas. It’s not worth getting worked up about. ,taurus,There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot impress. Today’s new moon in Capricorn means not only that you are full of confidence but that friends, colleagues and loved ones will go out of their way to assist you too.
taurus,Cosmic activity in the work and well being area of your chart warns youmust be careful not to over do it today. Youmay have a thousand and one things to do but you won’t get them all done at once. There’s always tomorrow.
taurus,The planets will bring to light a solution to a personal or professional problem you thought was here to stay. You should know by now that nothing is impossible: Everything worth knowing is revealed over time, so be patient.
taurus,Minor disputes could escalate into major disagreements over the next 48 hours, so try not to react emotionally to what you see or hear. No matter what happens, at home or at work, keep telling yourself it’s not nearly as bad as it looks.
taurus,This is a great time to be on the move, for business or for pleasure. The more people you meet the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Contacts with unusual people could be especially profitable this week.
taurus,A relationship that has fallen into a rut can be spiced up again but it won’t happen if you keep looking back to the past. Once you accept that it will never be the way it was you can start making it even better for the future.
taurus,You seem to think the worst is going to happen. You seem to think the sky is going to fall on your head. You should know by now that is exactly the sort of thought pattern that encourages bad things to happen. Be positive. ,taurus,Honest effort always gets results, so keep plugging away at what you are working on and don’t get dispirited if results are slow in coming. Nothing you do is ever wasted and one day soon you will make that breakthrough you long for.
taurus,You will be inspired to give of your best over the next 24 hours, no matter what it might be you are working on. Hold on to that positive, can-do attitude as long as you can, ideally until the moon is full seven days from now.
taurus,Even a Taurus needs to take a break now and again and the planets indicate this is the perfect time to sit quietly and ponder the meaning of your existence. If that sounds a bit too intellectual, just plan your next big vacation.
taurus,If you change your mind about something over the next few days you will only change it back again towards the end of the month when you realize you have got facts and figures completely wrong. Stick with what you already know.
taurus,Don’t listen to those who counsel caution. The only reason they don’t want you to do anything adventurous is because they are worried it will make them look bad. And they’re right, it will – which is all the more reason to do it.
taurus,Over the next few days it will feel like you have turned a corner, that better days are coming. They probably won’t arrive for a few weeks yet but because you know they are on their way you can start making plans. Make them big.
taurus,You would like nothing better than to turn your back on the past and start again but you know it isn’t practical. The planets urge you to make the most of the situation you find yourself in: it’s not as bad as you seem to believe.
taurus,Any plans you make now are under the influence of the full moon, so try not to take them too seriously. A lot depends on whether you made them rationally or emotionally. If it was the latter, they may have to be changed.
taurus,Something will happen today that to begin with annoys you, but when you calm down and think about it you will realize that it makes no difference to your plans. Carry on with what you were going to do – and do it brilliantly.
taurus,Over the next few days you will become increasingly focused on your position in the wider world. Most likely you will feel you could be making more of your talents and you’re right, you could. It’s time to move up a gear.
taurus,There will be several opportunities to boost your reputation and move up in the world over the coming week. But don’t think you have to fight every inch of the way. Turn on the charm – you’ll be amazed how far it takes you.
taurus,Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will do your reputation a power of good over the next few days, so put your doubts behind you and show the world you have what it takes. Work hard but don’t forget to play hard too.
taurus,This is the perfect time to enhance your status and give your reputation a boost. You will find favor with people in positions of power but the most important thing is that you believe in yourself – then others will believe in you too.
taurus,If there is something you have been trying to do but every time you get started something forces you to stop, it could be a sign you should be doing something else. Maybe the planets are trying to push you in a more rewarding direction.
taurus,You will fall out with someone who does not share your aims and opinions. It’s just as well. The longer you go on pretending that you can work together despite your differences the less likely it is you will get any serious work done.
taurus,Why are you so excitable? Whatever the reason you will be on the go from dawn to dusk today. You may need to rest and get your energy back tomorrow but for now you are a ball of energy that cannot be contained. Do something extraordinary.
taurus,You may be wondering if you have taken on too much or taken too much for granted. Ignore any fears you may have because this is only a temporary loss of self-belief and soon you will be taking on even bigger challenges.
taurus,You will find it much easier than usual to come up with big ideas this week, which is sure to impress employers and other important people. And that’s good because there is a new moon this week and that means new opportunities.
taurus,You have been worrying about something for no good reason and what happens over the next few days will convince you that you have in fact been rather lucky. That luck will continue as someone makes you an offer you won’t want to refuse.
taurus,You have your sights fixed on certain goals and won’t give up until you have reached them. However, cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs dreams and desires warns you need to get your ego out of the way. Let others guide you.
taurus,You may be determined to discover the truth about something you believe others have been covering up, but don’t start reading fanciful stuff into situations that are really quite normal. You may have suspicions, but keep them to yourself.
taurus,If you need to ask a favor of someone in a position of authority now is the time. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes it easy for you to approach employers and other important people. Flatter them shamelessly.
taurus,Something will seize your imagination today and before you know it you will be moving in a new direction. Does what you are doing have any practical or financial value? Who cares! It’s about enjoyment, not what you own or earn.
taurus,The questions you are asking yourself now may be the same questions you were asking yourself yesterday and the day before that but you will get completely different answers. How do you know what is true and what is false? Trust your instincts.
taurus,If you were planning something spectacular for the next few days it might pay you to think again, especially if there is money involved. The planets indicate there is no need to rush things – you are making good progress already.
taurus,You may find it hard to believe what you hear today but don’t reject it out of hand because it may be true. Reserve judgment until later in the week when there are more facts available – though, of course, “facts” can be flexible too.
taurus,Two weeks from now, when the Sun moves into one of the more positive areas of your chart, you will get the chance to do your own thing. Until then, though, you have to accept that others are still calling the shots. Stay calm. ,taurus,Do you go out and have fun or do you stay in and get some work done? If you are smart – and you are, you are – you will sacrifice short-term enjoyment for long-term peace of mind. In other words: get that work finished.
taurus,Do you carry on with a difficult task or do you end it and focus on something a bit easier? Only you can decide but it does seem a bit of a waste to give up on it so soon. What happened to that Taurus staying power?,taurus,Someone will tell you something you find hard to take seriously this weekend, but don’t dismiss it out of hand. If you dig a bit deeper you may find there is a nugget of truth in what they are saying, so try not to be too skeptical.
taurus,Don’t be afraid to admit that you are out of your depth. The moment you speak up you will have friends and family members rushing to assist you, so why suffer in silence? You’ve helped others so often in the past – now let them help you.
taurus,Whatever your ambitions may be right now, they will change dramatically over the next few weeks. Whatever happens you must believe that you are more than just a cog in the machine. You have the poise and the power to make a difference. ,taurus,You don’t find it easy to let others make decisions for you but today and tomorrow you are advised to put yourself in other people’s hands and let them call the shots. The planets indicate you won’t lose a thing. You may even win.
taurus,If you say one thing but do another you leave yourself open to charges of hypocrisy. You don’t need to cut corners or bend the truth: you have so much going for you that you will still come out ahead of the game however you play it.
taurus,You like to aim high and get on in the world but sometimes you wonder if it’s worth the effort. Only you can decide but now is not a good time to make decisions concerning either your career or your family. Think about it another day.
taurus,There is a solution to every problem and although the problem that confronts you this weekend may seem daunting if you stay calm and stick to the facts you will find a way to overcome it. The trick is to use your head, not lose it.
taurus,People in authority seem to favor you and because of that you can get away with most things but as from tomorrow they will expect you to become more of a team player. Can you do that? Of course you can – it’s in your interests.
taurus,As the Sun moves into in the area of your chart that governs your hopes and wishes, your dreams and aspirations, you cannot help but raise your sights and aim for something better in life. Be ready to make serious changes – and sacrifices.
taurus,You would be wise to keep your cash in your pocket today, because if you make one wrong move you may have to make several more to cover it up, and before you know what’s happening it will be costing you a fortune. Play safe. ,taurus,Aim to make new friends over the next 24 hours, especially with people whose interests are in some way out of the ordinary. It’s not true that Taurus is old-fashioned or has conservative tastes – in fact you can be a bit of a rebel.
taurus,Patience and a sense of humor are a must today. Something is about to happen that not only takes you by surprise but makes your plans redundant, much to your annoyance. Something else you may need: a sense of perspective.
taurus,There seem to be lots of hard luck stories about at the moment and you know that not a single one of them is true. You may be kind and generous by nature but anyone who asks for help this weekend may be out of luck.
taurus,A particular group of people may seem completely different to you but you have more in common with them than you realize. What happens this week will awaken you to the fact that you should be working, and laughing, together more often.
taurus,The line between fantasy and reality sometimes gets a bit blurred and there is a danger you could accidentally cross that line and do something foolish today. If you do make a mistake make sure you learn the lesson it has for you.
taurus,You need to find ways to further your ambitions while not appearing too pushy or too selfish. This may be a time of great uncertainty but it is also a time of great opportunity. Stay calm, stay focused and, above all, stay the course.
taurus,You seem to be hesitating and putting off something you know you will enjoy. Why is that? Whatever the reason you need to get started on it some time soon. Don’t worry that there may be an element of risk involved – that’s part of the fun.
taurus,According to the planets you could make some serious money, but first you need to get serious about your ambitions. Most of all you need to commit yourself to an objective that may take years to reach. Give it some thought.
taurus,Keep telling yourself that you have what it takes. Keep telling yourself that you will succeed. If you say it enough you will start to believe it and when that happens all sorts of doors will suddenly open to you. It’s all about your mind.
taurus,Focus your mind on what it is you want to accomplish in life, because with a new moon and the power of Jupiter to help you there is every chance your dream will soon be a reality – even more so if you team up with like-minded people.
taurus,You can influence people on the work front with ease this week, simply by being yourself. As Venus, your ruler, moves into the career area of your chart you will find it ridiculously easy to charm your way to success. So do it.
taurus,If you take a risk over the next 24 hours it will more than likely pay off, maybe in a big way. Remember: no matter how powerful or how strong your rivals may be you have what they do not – staying power and a total lack of fear.
taurus,You may be tempted to give up on something that just won’t go the way you want it to go. Don’t. Later this week something will happen that makes you realize that your slow progress is just a temporary blip – a necessary one too.
taurus,Now is the time to prove yourself. Now is the time to show the world what you are capable of. With your ruler Venus moving into the career area of your chart today you will impress people of power with ease – IF you make the effort.
taurus,You know what you want and you know how and where to get it, so all you have to do now is reach out your hand and take it. Sounds easy doesn’t it? Well that’s because it is. There can be no more excuses – make things happen!,taurus,You may be willing to change your plans to help someone out today but don’t let them, or anyone else, tell you that you are obliged to do so. Let them know this is a one-off situation. After today they must look out for themselves.
taurus,What happens over the next 48 hours, no matter how unexpected or how unsettling, will work in your favor in the long-term, so don’t fight it. And don’t get upset with a friend just because they disagree with you about something. It’s allowed!,taurus,You need to shut yourself off from the world and be alone with your thoughts for a while. Others may wonder why you are suddenly so anti-social but they will give you the time and the space that you need. They owe you.
taurus,Speak your mind today. Let the world know what you think. If certain people don’t like it that’s just too bad – in fact it’s a good sign. Jupiter in the communications area of your chart indicates that your words will have the desired effect.
taurus,Make sure you base partnerships, both personal and professional, on mutual respect, because if you try to take liberties with friends, loved ones or work colleagues today you could pay dearly for it around the time of the full moon on the 16th.
taurus,What comes to light in an unexpected manner today will most likely improve your bargaining position. It will also remind you that you don’t have to do it all on your own, that you have friends you can count on in a crisis.
taurus,It’s okay if you want to shut yourself off from the world and be alone with your thoughts for a while – it’s allowed. Others may think you are behaving strangely but only because they are insensitive. They don’t possess your imagination.
taurus,Use your imagination today. This is a great time for trying new things and adopting new methods, especially on the work front where, if you show you are able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, you could be up for a promotion.
taurus,This could be a tense weekend as family and work colleagues seem less than friendly for no obvious reason. Don’t worry about it. Most likely it has nothing to do with you. Most likely it’s just the full moon getting them down. It will pass.
taurus,You may be a bit impulsive over the next few days but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact it could be a good thing if it means your efforts get noticed by people in positions of authority. Show them what you are capable of.
taurus,Your mind may be bubbling with great ideas but what are they worth if you don’t do anything with them? If you want to get serious, if you want to make a difference in the world, it will take more than just ideas – it will take commitment.
taurus,Someone in a position of authority will ask you to do something extra for them today and if you are smart you will agree. You may not be in the mood to work harder but later you will look back and realize how much it benefited you.
taurus,It will benefit you to keep your plans to yourself today. Whatever information you may have that others do not you should treat it like gold dust. The less others know about what you are up to the more you will benefit.
taurus,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means you may tend to fear the worst over the next few days, but that is quite natural. How good or how bad you feel is really down to you alone. Promise yourself you’ll smile more.
taurus,You may have to remind a certain individual that you do not exist merely to be there when they call. Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn in your opposite sign will help you express negative feelings in a positive way – positive for you, at least.
taurus,What happens over the next few days might just transform the way you look at the world. The simple fact is you have been taking too much for granted and have been too trusting of those in positions of power. Start asking questions.
taurus,If a friend or relative needs lifting mentally don’t wait to be asked – jump right in and do what you can to cheer them up. Your optimistic attitude will bring a smile to their face and it won’t be long before they believe in themselves again. ,taurus,The omens are good for you now, so why do you still seem to think that something bad is about to happen? What you need to realize is that if you think like that you increase the chances that it will happen that way. Be positive.
taurus,You certainly have plenty of energy at your disposal but are you using it wisely? The planets will enable you to push harder and get more things done today but give some thought to your health as well. Don’t go to extremes.
taurus,Social activities will go well today, so make an effort to get out and about and meet new people. The more things you do with others the more you will enjoy yourself and the more of an effect your actions will have on the world.
taurus,Do you get involved in a feud between friends or do you keep your distance? You know the answer already, so don’t be silly and stand between them and try to keep the peace. If you do, quite probably they will gang up on you.
taurus,The planets will give you the confidence to step into the spotlight and let important people know what you are capable of. Don’t worry that they might think you are being too pushy because that’s just what they are looking for.
taurus,What you think is a problem is not really a problem at all and what happens next will help you recognize that fact. What is also a fact is that, despite what the doomsayers might say, the sky is not about to fall, at least not on you.
taurus,You may want to believe that everyone is as honest as you but, of course, it isn’t true. The planets warn you will need to be on your guard, especially when the Sun squares up to Jupiter on Tuesday. Don’t trust everything you hear. ,taurus,You may be more robust than many but some people are ridiculously sensitive and you would be wise to keep that fact in mind today. If you want to get things done you should make it a policy to say nice things only, for now.
taurus,There is no point getting worked up over something you can’t do much about. Having said that, while you may not be able to change things on a social or political level you can change things on a personal level. Just be a better person.
taurus,What others tell you may seem reasonable but if something does not ring true you would be wise to be cautious. Most likely you are wrong to be so suspicions but today’s cosmic set-up warns it’s not a good idea to take chances.
taurus,The planets will make it easy for you to complete a task that needs to be got out of the way as soon as possible. If you focus all your energy in a single direction today there is no telling what you might accomplish.
taurus,You may be tempted to hit back at someone who has been spreading gossip about you but is it worth it? If you say something rude in return they will see they have managed to get under your skin. Just ignore them – that will hurt more.
taurus,Yours may not be the most flexible sign of the zodiac but like it or not you will have to bend with the breeze over the next 48 hours. Don’t try to resist forces that are too strong for you or they will blow you clean away.
taurus,No matter what you are offered over the next seven days you must not do anything that goes against your principles. You won’t be happy with yourself if you discover later on that others have suffered as a result of your actions.
taurus,Sometimes you can be a bit offhand in your attitude and the planets warn you need to be more respectful if you want to get ahead. In everything you say and do try to work out how other people are likely to take it.
taurus,It may seem as if your time and energy has been wasted but that’s not true. In fact, by the end of the week you will realize that you have gained in unexpected ways. In the long-term no effort is truly wasted. You should know that by now.
taurus,Make sure you keep track of where your money is coming from and, just as importantly, where it is going to, over the next few days. Most people are trustworthy, of course, but someone may conveniently “forget” what they owe you.
taurus,This may not be an easy time of year for you but you can sense that the day will soon be here when your luck turns for the better. Maybe that day will come sooner if you act as if nothing could possibly go wrong.
taurus,Why are you trying to swim against the tide when you know it’s a battle you are destined to lose? You may not agree with the way things are going but common sense says you have no choice but to go with it, for now.
taurus,Don’t let your responsibilities weigh you down. You may have no option but to work hard and help other people but you don’t have to push yourself beyond your natural limits. Physically, emotionally and mentally you must be kind to yourself.
taurus,What you choose to do over the next seven days will to a large extent determine what the next six months or so are going to be like. The most important thing now is that you tie up loose ends, both in your personal life and in your career.
taurus,You may have your suspicions about someone but the planets warn this is probably not the right time to go public with them. Even if your suspicions are correct you should keep your thoughts to yourself, at least for the time being.
taurus,Are you working more for other people than you are for yourself? If so then it’s time to get a grip on the situation. Let those who are taking advantage of your generous nature know that this is as far as it goes – and mean it.
taurus,Refuse to get uptight about the little things that sometimes go wrong. Both at home and at work it will seem as if people are deliberately letting you down but the truth is everyone is a bit confused at the moment, so make allowances.
taurus,You may like to give the impression that you are immune to criticism but it’s not true and what someone says today will hurt you deeply. Could it be it hurts so much because, deep down, you know there might be some truth in it?,taurus,You won’t have to try hard to make an impression today – with your ruler Venus making positive links to major planets everyone will think you are someone special. If you’re not already flavor of the month, you very soon will be.
taurus,No matter how difficult life may have been of late the Sun’s move into your birth sign tomorrow will cheer you up no end. Give some serious thought to what you want to be doing over the coming year because it could be one of the best ever.
taurus,Now that the Sun is moving into your sign you should go with the flow and believe that the tide of events will wash you up on a shore that is to your liking. The message of the stars this week is to trust that the universe is infinitely kind.
taurus,You will encounter more than one individual today who, to put it bluntly, you really can’t stand the sight of. The best way of dealing with such people is to pretend they don’t exist. Just make out they’re invisible and walk on by.
taurus,Why is it always you who is expected to make the important decisions? Maybe because others know they can trust you. There will be a lot of upheavals over the coming 12 months but you will be a rock in the storm – and others will cling to you.
taurus,Mercury joins the Sun in your sign today and suddenly your mood will be a whole lot better. The next three weeks or so are potentially the best of the year for you, so take full advantage of the opportunities that come your way.
taurus,Your attitude to material things will change a lot over the coming year. People will count more with you than money and when you focus on family and friends you will find there are ways to be rich that trump everything else. It’s the true meaning of wealth.
taurus,All things may be possible for you now but the planets warn you should be tying up loose ends rather than starting anything new. Are you prepared for what is to come? Get your act together, and keep your friends close.
taurus,Not only will you succeed over the coming 12 months but you will succeed with style. The one thing that should – and does – matter to you more than anything is that, whatever job you agree to do, you do it better than anyone else. Be the best – always.
taurus,The solar eclipse in your sign on Tuesday means this is a week full of potential. Whatever it is you have been planning now is the time to get serious about it. You will find reserves of energy and enthusiasm you never knew you had.
taurus,Mars, planet of energy, will encourage you to be more assertive over the coming year, which is good, but you also need to plan carefully. If you just throw yourself at life with no rhyme or reason you won’t accomplish a fraction of what you are capable of.
taurus,You feel like you can take on the world and win – and most likely you can. Today’s eclipse in your sign endows you with the confidence to try things that at others times might scare you. Remember to focus your energy in one direction at a time.
taurus,Your way with words will open any door for you over the coming year. You know just what to say, and who to say it to, to get what you need. Move around as much as you can – the more you expand your horizons the more success you’ll enjoy.
taurus,Make sure you know what is expected of you before backing a plan or project that will inevitably take up a lot of your time and energy. And make sure there’s a timetable too – you need to know when you will be free again.
taurus,You may be tempted to slow down and take a break and you have certainly earned that right but the planets urge you to keep going a bit longer. Make the most of your energy surge while you can – you know how quickly things can change.
taurus,You may be poised to start something new and exciting but if you are smart you will give it another day or two before making your move. Sunday’s Sun-Pluto link will most likely bring huge changes – the sort you can take advantage of.
taurus,Try not to get too caught up in society and its problems this week or you may miss out on something of great value. Not all the answers you need are to be found out there in the world at large some come directly from the heart.
taurus,Someone in a position of authority will look favorably on you over the next few days and if you are smart you will get something more out of it than just praise. Ask for a raise or a promotion – or both. Chances are they’ll say “yes”.
taurus,The Sun’s link to Jupiter will give your confidence a much-needed boost today but you may still have to learn that in order to get some you also have to give some – you cannot realistically expect it to be all one way.
taurus,You must be positive today. Both in your personal life and at work there is a lot at stake and you need to know what you want – and have the courage to reach out and take it. If you can do all that you will prosper, big time.
taurus,You may be a bit hesitant and suspicious today but that’s okay. The thing to remember is that the cosmos is very much on your side at the moment, so you can afford to take a risk – or not, as you see fit.
taurus,You may believe that if you don’t act soon your big chance will pass you by but it simply isn’t true. The sense of urgency you feel is an illusion and what happens over the next two or three days will prove it. There’s really no rush.
taurus,You will be a force to be reckoned with over the next 48 hours. The Sun in your sign encourages you to come out of your shell and let the world see what a can-do Bull you can be. There is so much for you to accomplish.
taurus,Venus, your ruler, and Mars, planet of energy, combine on your birthday, which is good, but at times they will pull you indifferent directions. There will be two main strands to your affairs this year and some how you have to find room for them both.
taurus,Be true and honest and resist the temptation to cut corners merely because no one can stop you. This is a great time for friendships and group activities and it will be even better if you are all working together on the same ethical level.
taurus,Focus only on those activities that make you happy over the next 12 months. Others will say you should be doing this and doing that but it is entirely up to you how you order your life. If you follow your dreams all your other needs will be taken care of.
taurus,A full moon on your birthday is a reminder that your short-term goals and long-term goals must complement one another. Every step you take, no matter how small, should move you in the direction of your ultimate target. Don’t waste a day of your journey.
taurus,There may be a clash of wills today but at least it will clear the air – and remind certain people that just because you’re a nice guy does not mean you are a pushover. This is still your time of year and so much is still possible.
taurus,If you need to make changes, in either your personal life or your career, then make them without a second thought or a backward glance. Some people may think you are being needlessly ruthless but if you don’t change now it may never happen. Go for it!,taurus,Your mind creates your reality. What you think about now is what you will find yourself doing later. Meditate on that idea and let it influence what you think, say and do over the coming 12 months. You want happiness and success? Then create them.
taurus,Just because the Sun leaves your birth sign this week does not mean that your luck is about to turn for the worse. Plenty of good things will still come your way, only now you have to be a bit more sensible about how you use them.
taurus,If everyone seems to be saying what you want to hear it is probably because that is their intention. Mercury is the planet of communication but also deception and its position today suggests you can’t really trust what you hear.
taurus,You will have to deal with some pretty ruthless people over the coming 12 months and that means you will have to be ruthless yourself. Decide where you are going to draw the line and tell them what will happen if they step over it. And mean it!,taurus,Make a name for yourself. Do something out of the ordinary. Start each day with a specific goal in mind and go all out to reach it. Also, remember that, both in your work and in your private life, excellence is what you do in the next five minutes.
taurus,Your insight is such that others may wonder if you are psychic. Maybe you are, in a way, but there is nothing supernatural about your aims: you want to be a success and you want to be rich. Act on what your inner voice tells you.
taurus,You need to come down to earth a bit and deal with matters of a practical nature. Above all you must be sensible with money, especially if you are the kind of Taurus who takes an “easy come, easy go” attitude to cash.
taurus,You don’t know whether to push yourself harder or take things easy. If you feel the need to prove yourself by all means take on new responsibilities but make sure you get plenty of rest too. Don’t hammer yourself into the ground.
taurus,There is no point worrying about a money matter because it is out of your hands. The approaching new moon suggests that it’s highly unlikely anything bad will happen, at least not to you. You might even come out ahead of the game.
taurus,The moment you start seeing yourself as a victim is the moment when you lose. No matter what other people may be saying and doing you and you alone are master of your fate, so be positive and think like a winner again.
taurus,You need to be a bit more serious about your cash flow situation. Tomorrow’s new moon will make it clear where and how savings need to be made – after that it’s up to you. No more shopping sprees for you – for now.
taurus,You must hold out for what it is you know you deserve. The planets indicate it will be your rivals who blink first, so look tough, act tough and be tough in your approach to all kinds of negotiations, especially those involving money.
taurus,You need to open up a bit and show your vulnerable side. Too often you give the impression that nothing can bring you down when, in reality, you are as sensitive as everyone else. Find a comfortable shoulder to cry on today.
taurus,You are strongly advised not to make too many plans – you have enough on your plate as it is. If someone asks you to take on extra responsibilities you must turn them down flat. Your health could be at risk if you push yourself too hard.
taurus,You are trying too hard to impress other people. Don’t worry what friends or work colleagues may think about you, just focus your time and energy on what you should be doing and the results will speak volumes about your ability.
taurus,You will be rather assertive over the next few days, which is good. However, if you find yourself in a situation where you are able to make others do what they clearly don’t want to do you must back off. Their feelings are important too.
taurus,Be careful when dealing with people today, especially if money is in some way involved. Anything that sounds too good to be true most likely is, so don’t let your enthusiasm – or your greed – get the better of you.
taurus,Watch what you spend over the next 24 hours because if you go over the top you are sure to regret it. The planets warn you may not be as well off as you seem to believe. Watch out for those hidden costs.
taurus,Sometimes the standards you set are impossible to reach and that seems to be the case at the moment. Current influences make you intensely ambitious but don’t forget you have limits like everyone else. Make sure you know what they are.
taurus,Why are you trying to do everything the hard way? Is it because you think you have to prove yourself? Not only is it unnecessary but it could also be self-defeating. Be who you are, not who you think others want you to be.
taurus,You will get the chance to move up in the world today but you need to act quickly. Uranus, planet of the unexpected, will bring sudden upheavals but even though they may seem a bit frightening they will work in your favor.
taurus,Your routine will be disrupted in some way today and although you won’t like it you will have to adapt. Don’t bother complaining to people in positions of power because they don’t really care. Keep a low profile – it’s by far your best option.
taurus,Because Taurus is one of the zodiac’s “fixed” signs you don’t like to admit, even to yourself, that you might ever be wrong. That could be a problem this week as the planets demand you be more flexible. Can you even spell the word?,taurus,The more you try to convince people that you know what you are doing the more they disbelieve you – a most frustrating situation! Never mind. You don’t need their support to do what you know must be done. You’re tough enough to go it alone.
taurus,The planets warn you will have to fight hard to get your way today. Alternatively, of course, you could decide the effort isn’t worth it and not fight at all. Let fate take its course. You don’t have to be in control all the time.
taurus,You seem to have retreated into your shell a bit of late and in doing so have lost contact with a number of important people. Make it a priority today to look them up and let them know you still exist – and you still care.
taurus,The planets warn you may do something so out of character today or tomorrow that even those who know you well will be shocked. Hopefully it won’t damage your reputation too much but it will certainly lead to some interesting gossip!,taurus,You will be in an impulsive mood today and there is a danger you might fall out with someone you really should be on good terms with. There is no point starting a war of words just because you don’t care for the way they do business.
taurus,A lot of your time of late seems to have been spent on issues that are not worth the effort and people you will never really get along with. As from today you must be more selective. What is of prime importance to you? Do only that.
taurus,Try not to show that you are sensitive about what other people are saying about you. If they can see you are hurt it will encourage them to be even more negative. Give the impression that you could not care less about their opinions.
taurus,Money matters of one sort or another will take up a lot of time today. It may all seem rather trivial to you but you must take it seriously. The more financial loose ends you can tie up now the more fun you can have later on.
taurus,Why are some people so negative? It seems that the more ideas and suggestions you come up with the more reasons they find to reject them. Maybe you should take the hint and stop trying to win them round. Go it alone for a while.
taurus,Even if you are the kind of Taurus who keeps your emotions under control you will be much more outgoing than usual today. There are so many good things going on in your life that you’ve got to stand up and tell the whole world.
taurus,There is no point cursing fate if what happens today is not to your liking. In the long-term everything will come good, so be strong and never doubt that no matter what happens, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you will be stronger for it.
taurus,You may be tempted to interfere in someone else’s personal situation but no good will come of it. The simple fact is you cannot do everything for everyone, so decide who is on your help list and let others learn from their own mistakes.
taurus,There were times of late when you came close to cracking but you kept at it and managed to turn a bad situation in your favor. Now you are in a position to turn the tables and put the pressure on your rivals. Do it with a smile.
taurus,Your way with words will aid you over the next few days but it could also work against you if you use it to deceive people into believing things you know to be untrue. It might help you in the short-term but over time you’ll lose out.
taurus,Friends and relatives will do what you ask of them if you ask nicely. Also, if there is something you know they desire and you are in a position to get it for them then go for it. Bribery is not always a bad thing!,taurus,If you are tired of playing second fiddle to someone of lesser talent then now is the time to do something about it. Let employers and other important people know what you can do. Part of the problem is you rarely push yourself forward.
taurus,It annoys you when others drag their feet but there is no point losing your temper if a friend or loved one takes too much time over something today. Think of it as part of life’s rich tapestry – and do whatever it takes to hold in that scream.
taurus,The world is a wonderful place and what happens over the next 48 hours will remind you just how much is possible if you have a positive outlook on life. Your can-do attitude will encourage others to be positive too.
taurus,Short trips will be productive today, so don’t stay in one place for too long. The more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet people who can be of some use to you socially or in your career.
taurus,At some stage over the next 48 hours you will see or hear something that makes you look at the world in a radically different way. Your new way of thinking will answer many of the difficult questions you have been asking.
taurus,You need to keep up the pressure on those who seek to deny you what it is you deserve. If you give them even the smallest of hints that you might give up they will go all out to deny you. Make a fuss – and hang in there.
taurus,You need to get serious about your money situation. For too long now you have been content to take what you were given but as communications planet Mercury is about to move in your favor again you must ask for more. No, demand it!,taurus,The more others protest about what you are doing the more you will do it. You’re stubborn like that. Just be careful that your abrasive attitude does not upset someone in a position of authority. Why make enemies of powerful people?,taurus,Something good will come your way today – something you have earned entirely by your own efforts. Others may say you don’t deserve to be so fortunate but only because they now wish they had been as creative and as hard-working as you.
taurus,There is no need to be quite so competitive. The planets indicate if you relax and let life come to you today the rewards will be greater than you imagined – and you won’t have wasted your time and your energy on senseless rivalries.
taurus,You like to take the initiative and make things happen but today you will have to yield to the whims of those who do not share your sense of adventure. It may be frustrating but you can’t change it so don’t let it upset you.
taurus,The more others insist that you conform to their standards the more you will insist on going your own way and doing your own thing. You will be even more stubborn than usual over the next 48 hours – and that’s very stubborn indeed!,taurus,You may be annoyed that you lost out in some way but you have only yourself to blame. Others warned you not to go it alone but did you listen? Of course not. In future, try not to be so stubborn and recognize who is trying to help.
taurus,Life may be a bit of a struggle at the moment but on the plus side you will learn something useful from it. You are here for a reason. Your life has meaning and purpose. So stop complaining and start living again.
taurus,It is always important to get your timing right and the planets indicate that the right time for making your mark on the world is now. Don’t wait to be asked to show what you can do – elbow your way to the front and just do it.
taurus,The grass often looks greener on the other side of the fence but the planets warn you should stay right where you are. If you are thinking of changing your job, or maybe even your entire career, you are advised to think again.
taurus,You like things to be in their proper place but some people enjoy making a mess just to annoy you. You know who they are and you know better than to let them get under your skin. Stay out of their way today.
taurus,If your frame of mind is negative now you will find it hard to be positive over the next few days. Try to avoid people whose attitude might bring you down. If they want to be miserable that’s fine but you don’t have to join them.
taurus,News from a distant place may not be music to your ears but don’t overreact. Today’s full moon cuts across the communications angle of your chart, so if you say the wrong thing you may regret it. Keep your thoughts to yourself.
taurus,By all means turn down a social invitation in order to spend more time with someone you are close to emotionally. According to the planets this person is feeling a bit neglected and it’s your responsibility to do something about it.
taurus,Act quickly if someone in a position of power offers you something you desire. It’s okay to be cautious, at least to begin with, but if you leave it too long you could find the opportunity has been offered to someone else.
taurus,The more others try to persuade you there is nothing to worry about the more you wonder what they are trying to hide. Maybe you are being suspicious for no reason but, on the other hand, the planets do suggest you need to be careful.
taurus,You need to stand back from money matters and business issues and see your life from a wider perspective. There are many types of wealth and the most important of all is to be rich in knowledge – and love, of course.
taurus,You are entitled to enjoy yourself and there is no reason at all why you should feel guilty just because some people have not been as lucky as you. Help others when you get the chance but make sure you get the best out of life too.
taurus,Your task for the next 24 hours is to find a way to release all that pent-up energy that’s inside you in a way that does you good while not harming other people. Give it some thought, then do something physical.
taurus,You seem to be reluctant to try something everybody else is raving about. Maybe you’re right, maybe your sixth sense is telling you to take care. Or maybe you are being too cautious. Ultimately, of course, only you can decide.
taurus,If you want to earn other people’s respect you have to lead by example. That applies in all areas but especially on the home front where the planets indicate that loved ones are on the point of rebellion! Don’t be too assertive for your own good.
taurus,This is an important time for career matters, especially if you are the kind of Taurus who wants to get on in the world. Being ambitious is not a sin and anyone who suggests that it might be is not to be trusted.
taurus,It may seem as if the whole world is against you but nothing could be further from the truth. All that is happening is that the Sun’s move into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart makes youmore touchy than usual. Lighten up!,taurus,If the stresses and strains of life are beginning to get to you just take an hour or two out of your busy schedule and sit somewhere quiet where you can refresh both your body and mind. You must always find time to relax.
taurus,Someone close needs a confidence boost and you are the one who can give it to them. Say or do what you know will make them feel good about themselves – as a bonus it will help you feel good about yourself as well.
taurus,Someone you like may say something hurtful about you today, but you must not let it get to you and you must not let your friendship suffer. There is no ill intent and you are probably being a bit too sensitive for your own good.
taurus,Expect many changes over the next 48 hours, both those you are happy with and those you would avoid if you possibly could. Certain people may at times annoy you but don’t lose your temper – it’s simply not worth the effort.
taurus,It won’t be long before you find your voice and let others know what it is you expect of them. It might be wise, however, not to say anything too outrageous, especially as Venus, your ruler, opposes power planet Pluto over the next few days.
taurus,Today’s cosmic activity means you will need to spell everything out in plain and simple language. If you leave even the smallest of room for doubt then lines will get crossed and tempers will get frayed and that’s no good to anyone.
taurus,If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. If you have the courage to take a risk when everyone around you is telling you to stick with what you know and trust you may hit the jackpot. Listen to your instincts – always.
taurus,There is a danger that you will overreact to criticism and say or do something that comes back to haunt you. Both at home and at work you must think carefully before replying to what others say. Stay in control of your emotions.
taurus,A colleague will let you down today and you won’t be too happy about it. But don’t let it bother you too much because you are capable of carrying on and making a success of a project on your own – and all the glory will be yours.
taurus,If someone you don’t usually get along with makes an effort to be nice to you today you must make an effort to be nice to them in return. Just because you have different values does not mean you cannot get along, or even be friends.
taurus,You may not be able to explain to others how you have reached a certain conclusion but deep down you know it is right. The planets indicate you won’t be in the least bit hesitant – you know what you want and you know how to get it.
taurus,You want to do something useful with your life and Neptune, planet of generosity of spirit, will give you the opportunity this week. Don’t try to do it alone though: do it with people who share your ideals – and your big heart.
taurus,Your logic circuits may seem a bit disconnected today and you will have to make an effort not to let little things annoy you. Strive to see the good in everyone you meet. It won’t always be easy but it’s there if you look for it.
taurus,You have never been a slave to your desires, so why are you acting as if you have no choice in what you are expected to do? The fact is you always have a choice and to claim otherwise is simply not right. Take responsibility.
taurus,Over the next few days you will have to strike a balance between the needs of your loved ones and the needs of employers and other important people. You CAN please them all but you need to be smart and plan carefully.
taurus,You want to be active, and that’s good, but don’t expect others to be as motivated as you. Not everyone shares your passion for making things work and this may be one of those days when the only way to get things done is to do them yourself.
taurus,Focus on other people’s needs today, because the planets will give you the chance to be of service to someone who does not share your strength of character. And, of course, what you do for others now will, one day, come back to you.
taurus,It may seem as if the odds are stacked against you but the planets suggest you can easily break through any obstacles that have been placed in your path. Let everyone know you mean business. Few will dare take you on.
taurus,Try not to jump to conclusions this week because most likely they will be wrong. Wait until the early part of next week before deciding if a friend really has let you down, because only then will you be able to see the situation clearly.
taurus,You are not the kind who enjoys having your private life made public and at some stage today you will have to let someone know that their big mouth is not appreciated. They’ll get the message, if you say it with enough menace.
taurus,By all means aim high, by all means set yourself targets, but don’t make them so far ahead of what you are capable of that failure is more likely than not. You don’t have to be perfect – you’re perfect just the way you are.
taurus,If you find yourself torn between your loved ones and your busy work schedule today the best thing to do is to make a decision and stick to it. You can’t please everyone but if you don’t make a choice you won’t please anyone.
taurus,Friends and loved ones have the upper hand at the moment and if you are smart you will accept that and not make a fuss. Also, it might not be wise to draw too much attention to yourself on the work front. Keep a low profile.
taurus,The pace of life will pick up considerably today and over the weekend and if you are involved in anything of a creative nature it will go extremely well for you. Make sure the powers that be are aware of what you can do.
taurus,There will be times this weekend when doubts creep in and you do not feel as self-assured as you look. Developments on the work front may be especially unsettling but there is no need to worry – it will work out for the best in the end.
taurus,If you fell out with a friend or work colleague recently you should be thinking of ways you can make up with them. That may not be possible until later in the week but you can set the scene now – by not being so touchy!,taurus,By all means splash out and buy yourself something that makes you feel good. Okay, so maybe you will regret it later when your credit card bill is due but you need something to cheer you up right now. Go for it.
taurus,You are being pulled between two extremes, making it difficult for you to make up your mind about the best course of action. Do you take a chance or do you play safe? Only you can decide, but you must make it quick.
taurus,You need to give others the impression that you are not the sort who can be easily manipulated. Act tough today, even if you don’t feel tough inside, because the first impression you give others is the impression that will last.
taurus,Over the past few weeks cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart has made it hard to be positive, but that will change on Saturday when the Sun moves in your favor. Suddenly life will be worth living again. ,taurus,An unpleasant issue will have to be dealt with today. You can avoid it no longer. Of course, if you had sorted it out when the situation first arose several months ago you would not be in this position now. Never mind, get busy.
taurus,The Sun’s change of signs this weekend marks the start of the most dynamic time of the year, for you at least. Forget about your troubles and think only of the fun times you are going to have. There will be too many of them to count.
taurus,Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart will inspire you to think and act in adventurous new ways over the next few days. In fact it is no exaggeration to say it will in some way or other transform your existence.
taurus,You were born with some remarkable talents but have you been making the most of them? If you are honest you will admit you could have done more but that’s okay because you will always get another chance and here comes one now!,taurus,Don’t complain that certain people seem to be making life difficult for you because, even if it is true, it will be to your advantage. Sometimes in life it is necessary to take a small step back before you can take a huge leap forward.
taurus,Be on your guard today, especially when dealing with money matters. There is a danger that someone will try to cheat you, and if your mind is elsewhere they may even succeed. Trust is not something you should give easily now.
taurus,If you expect great things of yourself then you will accomplish great things. But make sure it is your own expectations you are trying to live up to – not other people’s. Friends and family will never know you as well as you know yourself.
taurus,It may seem as if someone is being rude for no good reason, and maybe they are, but don’t let it get to you. Move your attention away from their negativity and highlight instead the positive plans you have made. Focus on your dream.
taurus,Be alert to new possibilities. You may be happy with your life but there is always something you can do to make it even better and you will know without a shadow of a doubt what that something is this week. Don’t get stuck in a rut. ,taurus,You seem to be worrying about the few little things that are going wrong in your life and ignoring all the big things that are going right. Raise your sights and see the wider cosmic picture. Life is good and getting better by the minute.
taurus,Money matters will go very well indeed today as will anything to do with your working routine. It seems that Lady Luck is very much on your side at the moment and if you are smart you will make good use of her.
taurus,This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, but the things you do must not be of a minor nature. Make use of today’s Sun-Pluto contact to aim higher than usual. Look to the sky, then shoot for the stars.
taurus,If there is something you have always wanted to do but never quite got around to starting, don’t worry – you are about to get another chance. This is the ideal time to begin something of a creative nature, so get serious about it.
taurus,The next few weeks will be special for you, and for those who are special to you. Even people you think of as rivals or enemies will be more amenable than usual. So if you need to ask favors now is the time to make your play.
taurus,The harder you try to bring a little happiness into someone’s life the more determined they are to be sad. Take the hint and leave them alone. Some people enjoy wallowing in despair, so leave them to it until they’re ready to smile again.
taurus,You should by now have a clear idea of what it is you are hoping to accomplish, and because there are no more doubts in your mind you will be able to take decisive action at last. Act for others too when you can.
taurus,According to the planets you are unusually in tune with the spirit of the age – for the next 24 hours at least – so don’t be surprised if strangers approach you and treat you as if you are someone special. Because you are.
taurus,If a dispute over a career or family matter seems to be dragging on, now is the time to settle your differences. The full moon means it’s not a case of one side winning and the other side losing – either you both win or you both lose.
taurus,A new person on your social scene will get your attention and you may even be thinking in terms of romance, but the planets warn the relationship is unlikely to last. Keep it low key and light-hearted and you’ll both have a lot of fun.
taurus,Whatever difficulties you face at this moment don’t try to blame other people for them. The more you deny that you are responsible the worse things are likely to get. Next time around, don’t forget that causes always have consequences.
taurus,You must be true to your principles today. A rival may appear to have an advantage because they are prepared to use dishonest methods but over time their tactics will rebound on them, leaving you with a clear run to success.
taurus,A serious attempt to cut back on your spending now will save you a great deal of trouble later on. Do you really need all those things you’ve been buying? Of course not. Get your financial house in order over the next 48 hours.
taurus,It may feel like you are losing something that is precious to you but when you realize what the future has in store – as you will do any day now – your hankering after what you lost will soon be forgotten. The future is where it’s at.
taurus,Something you say may seem obvious to you but other people may struggle to understand what you are talking about. Try to see things from their point of view, then explain what’s going on in plain and simple language.
taurus,An opportunity to improve a partnership or relationship could easily be missed. Focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Career issues and money matters may seem important but in the greater scheme of things they don’t count for much.
taurus,The Sun in Virgo endows you not only with a positive outlook but also a willingness to take risks. Something you begin over the next few days could change your life in remarkable ways, so stop dithering and start living the dream.
taurus,Avoid anything too adventurous today, especially if it is packaged in an appealing way. Stick with what feels right to you, even if others say it is boring. You know what you like and there is no logical reason why you should change it.
taurus,It does not matter what threats you make today a work colleague will move at their own speed – and that’s dead slow! Don’t bother losing your temper as it will just encourage them to dig in their heels even more. Grit your teeth and bear it.
taurus,You are enjoying life at the moment but you sense that you will soon have to turn your mind to more serious matters. Pay more attention to your health this weekend. It may be time for a new diet or fitness regime.
taurus,You know what you want and you know how to get it but don’t push too hard. Your confidence may be high at the moment but confidence alone may not be enough. The planets warn it will pay you to take things slowly for a day or two.
taurus,Be careful you don’t offend people by making a joke about things they take very seriously. Yes, of course, the world would be a better place if everyone could laugh at misfortune, especially their own, but it isn’t going to happen.
taurus,A testing phase is about to begin but you can make things easier for yourself by being a little less intense in both your attitude and your actions. Your workload will increase but don’t be tempted to burn the candle at both ends.
taurus,You may have a natural grasp of how something works but a friend or family member just isn’t getting it and it’s up to you to help them out. Don’t get impatient, just explain it to them in simple language – several times if needs be.
taurus,No doubt there is a rational explanation for everything that ever happens but sometimes things happen that make you wonder if there is not more going on. Keep your mind open to new and strange possibilities over the next 24 hours.
taurus,Something will happen over the next few days that undermines your confidence, and it takes a lot to make a Taurus start questioning themselves. Be that as it may everything will be resolved when Venus, your ruler, changes signs next week.
taurus,A dispute that has dragged on far too long must be resolved this weekend. Make an effort to see the other person’s side of the story as well as your own. The fact is that neither of you is either wholly right or wholly wrong.
taurus,The lesson of the stars for the coming week is that you must learn to be grateful for what you have got. Something you have always taken for granted is about to be challenged and it will make you realize just how lucky you are. ,taurus,If a friend or work colleague tries to turn each and every chat you have into a conversation about them you must let them know it’s getting a bit boring. It’s not about “them” or “me” – it’s about “us”. Or at least it should be.
taurus,Make an effort to tackle routine matters today, Yes, of course, they are boring but if you don’t get them out of the way now they will continue to nag at you. You may also learn something you can turn to your financial advantage.
taurus,You seem to be in one of your silly moods – and that’s a good thing. Most days you might worry what others think of your behavior but today you just cannot be bothered. If more conservative types are offended that’s too bad.
taurus,Don’t wait for permission to do something you instinctively know is right. Even the most agreeable Taurus should be more assertive when there is a higher good at work. And remember: the best way to get something done is to do it yourself.
taurus,There may be many things in your life that you could change for the better but is it worth it if, in doing so, you have to change habits and routines you feel comfortable with? Only you can decide, but you need to decide quickly.
taurus,If you are satisfied with an agreement of some kind then it does not matter what other people think about it. Yes, maybe you could negotiate a better deal if you were a bit tougher, but if you’re happy the universe is happy too.
taurus,Whether or not you have a hard time of things this week depends not on your circumstances but on your state of mind. A lunar eclipse in the most sensitive area of your chart urges you to look on the bright side – always.
taurus,According to the planets you have reached the end of one particular road and what happens in the run-up to Wednesday’s eclipse will point you in a new direction. After that it’s up to you. What’s holding you back? Absolutely nothing.
taurus,What happens in your working environment over the next few days will give you the chance to show how much you have learned and how well suited you are to take on a leadership position. While others lose their heads you will be the picture of calm.
taurus,Treat yourself today – do something for no other reason than it makes you feel good. Some people may be shocked by your extravagant behavior but that will only add to your enjoyment. How far do you take it? As far as you like!,taurus,A business or financial venture may seem straightforward but as Mercury is in one of its retrograde phases there may be hidden pitfalls. For that reason alone you are advised not to commit yourself unless you have a get-out clause – in writing.
taurus,You must be decisive today, especially on the work front where the right word in the right ear at the right time could open doors that have been closed for too long. Don’t hesitate: the moment an opportunity arises you must seize it.
taurus,If you pretend to be something or someone you are not over the next 48 hours you are sure to be found out, and the results could be embarrassing. The personality you were born with cannot be changed but it can be improved – so embrace it.
taurus,If your desire is strong enough and if your motives are pure enough you will attract into your life precisely what you need this week. You are sending out powerful signals to the universe and the universe will be delighted to grant you your wish.
taurus,The more you worry about something the worse it will get. But the opposite is also true: the more you look on the bright side and believe everything will come right the better it will get. Your reality reflects what goes on in your mind.
taurus,A number of serious matters will have to be dealt with later in the week but today you can relax and enjoy the good things in life. Venus, your ruler, linked to Jupiter means you will find fun wherever you are and whatever you do.
taurus,The planets are very much on your side at the moment but for best results you should not wait for things to happen, you should make things happen yourself. If you make twice as much effort today you will get four times as much back.
taurus,At some stage today it will be painfully clear that you have been moving in the wrong direction, and that means you must change course immediately. Ignoring the evidence will only compound the error and make things even worse than before.
taurus,It’s nice to know that your efforts are appreciated and Saturn in your opposite sign is about to bring you some kind of reward or recognition. It may not be anything out of the ordinary but it will give a huge boost to your confidence.
taurus,Don’t be too harsh on yourself if you say something that rubs others up the wrong way. Yes, of course, it would have been nice if you had given it a bit more thought before opening your mouth but no one’s perfect, not even you! ,taurus,There may be many things that interest you but there is only one thing that demands your attention. A serious matter needs to be dealt with today and, if you deal with it quickly and efficiently, you can then move on to something more exciting.
taurus,The approaching eclipse marks either a turning point or a point of no return. Which it is depends a great deal on your attitude. Treat what goes out of your life over the next few days as surplus to requirements – you really no longer need it.
taurus,A little voice in the back of your head is telling you to get tough with someone who has taken one too many liberties in recent weeks. If you don’t they will take an even bigger liberty tomorrow or the day after, and the results could be ugly.
taurus,As both the Sun and Venus, your ruler, move into the partnership area of your chart today it will pay you to be more open about your feelings. Not too much though – others don’t want to know everything – just that they mean something to you.
taurus,It may seem like a partnership of some sort has reached a point where it can no longer do anything for you but you are wrong. What happens today will make you realize you have been taking it for granted – and it still has much to offer.
taurus,What takes place this weekend may not be entirely to your liking but if you make a point of viewing new experiences as opportunities rather than as setbacks this can still be a positive phase. Expect the best and you will get the best.
taurus,There is only so much you can do for someone you love – at some point you have to let them get on with it and learn from their own mistakes. If they take a fall then so be it – all you can do is be there to help them up again.
taurus,Avoid complicated solutions. The problem you will be faced with over the next two or three days is really quite simple, which means the answer must be simple too. Focus on the basics and don’t read into it what isn’t there at all.
taurus,Don’t get so absorbed in a work or social issue that you miss the signals a loved one is sending you. They need your attention and, what is more, they have a right to it. Mundane matters can wait – relationships cannot.
taurus,If someone reacts in an emotional way to what you say today then perhaps you should take the hint and steer clear of touchy issues. They will have to face up to reality sooner or later, of course, but now is not the right time.
taurus,You may be eager to know what is going on but the planets suggest it’s unlikely that family and friends will confide in you. Stay calm and don’t let them see how desperate you are — that will make them even more secretive.
taurus,What happens today may not by itself seem of any great significance but with the benefit of hindsight you will see it plays a big part in the grand scheme of things. Never doubt you are on the road to somewhere good. ,taurus,A touch of realism is needed today, both on a creative level and in affairs of the heart. You don’t want to be unkind, of course, but you realize it is better to be blunt than misunderstood. Loved ones will one day thank you for your honesty.
taurus,The more time and effort you pour into a certain situation the worse it appears to get. Why not take the hint and back off a bit? You will enjoy life more if you stop worrying about things over which you have no control. ,taurus,It would be a mistake to place your faith in what other people believe rather than what your instincts tell you is true. Have the courage of your convictions and do only what feels right to you. You don’t need anyone to hold your hand.
taurus,You may be tempted to put pressure on a partner or loved one do something for you but according to the planets it isn’t necessary. Even if they do not agree with your aims they will, out of a sense of duty, help if they can. Just ask nicely.
taurus,If a friend or relative wants to make a decision for you, let them. You should find it easier to trust other people’s judgment now that Mercury is moving into your opposite sign of Scorpio. Yes, they have your interests at heart.
taurus,What starts out as good news first thing this week may look like bad news later in the week but try not to get worked up about it. Things change and all you can do is change with them. What changes later in the week will delight you.
taurus,Be honest about what you think today, even if your point of view is likely to offend certain people. You are as entitled to your opinion as they are to theirs, so speak up and make sure you get your message across. It’s a message worth hearing.
taurus,Be clear about what you believe and be positive when communicating those beliefs to other people. You will find that all sorts of people are interested in what you have to say, but listen as well, because learning is a two-way process. ,taurus,The pressure is beginning to mount and you feel there are things in your life which need to be changed, and you are right. The fact is if you cannot change them yourself, fate will change them for you. Maybe you should let it.
taurus,Your powers of self-discipline will be tested over the next 24 hours – and you will pass the test with flying colors. However, a harder test is on its way, so don’t think you have done all you have to. Be vigilant.
taurus,You need something to take your mind off your problems. Better still, you need to reorder your mind so you can see they are not really problems at all. Treat life as a game and make sure you have fun – then you’ll be a winner too.
taurus,You will have to be strict with yourself this weekend if you are to finish all the tasks you have set yourself. Start immediately and don’t stop until everything is done. The longer you put it off, the harder it will be. ,taurus,There is nothing you cannot handle and nothing you cannot do if you believe in yourself. It may seem as if others have more talent and experience than you but it’s simply not true. Act as if you cannot fail, and you won’t.
taurus,Loved ones, colleagues and people in positions of authority hold you in high regard because you are an individual – you refuse to be like everyone else. Emphasize your uniqueness today and you will find your natural place – at the top.
taurus,If you feel the urge to travel today don’t let work hold you back. There will be no end of opportunities to complete outstanding tasks over the next few days, so forget about your daily schedule and have fun. You need a break from routine.
taurus,Concentrate on what you are good at and ignore everything else. You may find that difficult to do as the planets seem determined to disrupt your routine but few signs are as focused as you once you decide what it is you desire.
taurus,What someone tells you today may seem confusing and contradictory but if you think about it a bit you will get the message. Some people find it difficult to say things in a straightforward manner, so get out your pocket translator. ,taurus,If life is what happens to us while we are busy making other plans then what happens this weekend may come as a bit of a shock. The plans you made may not work out the way you expected, but events could still move in your favor.  ,taurus,There will be times over the coming week when you wonder why you have been singled out for so much good fortune. Do you really deserve it? Yes you do, in fact no one deserves it more. Stop putting yourself down for no reason.
taurus,A plan to boost your earning power may be tempting but if it means doing something that leaves you feeling uncomfortable with yourself then maybe you should give it a miss. Like love, self-respect is something that money can’t buy. ,taurus,Ideas and insights are coming thick and fast but because Taurus is such a down-to-earth sign you may be reluctant to act on a hunch or a whim. But you must. The ideas and insights of today are the realities of tomorrow. ,taurus,If you come in for criticism today – and with Saturn strong in your opposite sign that is almost guaranteed – don’t react as if the world is coming to an end. There may in fact be some truth in what others are saying about you.
taurus,No matter how many times you may have doubted your instincts in the past, don’t doubt them today. According to the planets you are in tune with the spirit of the times – and it’s about time you made it pay!,taurus,If you try to please everyone this weekend you will end up pleasing no one, so do what feels right to you and live with the consequences. Your can-do attitude will impress others, which is nice, but you don’t have to be popular to be successful.
taurus,Something you thought you knew all about will work out in a completely unexpected way and something you are completely in the dark about will suddenly seem so familiar. So don’t jump to conclusions – they will probably be wrong.
taurus,The task you have to tackle over the next few days may not seem too inspiring but once you get to grips with it you will find it engages your interest more than you imagined. Who knows, you may even grow to like it! ,taurus,You cannot possibly be on good terms with everyone all of the time – even a good-natured Taurus will fall out with friends and loved ones once in a while. But it’s no big deal, so don’t beat yourself up today if harsh words are spoken. ,taurus,If someone has been taking advantage of your good nature then you must cut them out of your life. They will see you are serious and will come back with their tail between their legs begging for forgiveness. Whether you grant it is up to you.
taurus,Do you focus on what others expect you to do, or do you focus on what you want to do? Only you can decide but you must choose one or the other – if you try to get the best of both worlds you may end up with neither.
taurus,It will occur to you over the next 24 hours that you have been taking the wrong things seriously. Something you have been working so hard towards is most likely not worth the effort, but that’s okay – once you accept that you can make other plans.
taurus,According to the planets you have reached the low point of your current emotional cycle and from here on things will get noticeably easier. Today’s full moon will encourage you to see your glass as half full rather than half empty.
taurus,Don’t give yourself such a hard time over the next few days – make life easy for yourself by refusing to get worked up about trivial matters. Be warned: interfering with the natural course of events could have unnatural consequences!,taurus,An embarrassing event will make you a bit sheepish about showing your face in certain circles but so what if you made a fool of yourself? No one is perfect, not even a Taurus, so laugh about your mistake – and others will laugh with you. ,taurus,Refuse to settle for second best in anything you do. The standards you set now are the standards you will have to live by for the next few months, so aim high, be first and don’t let anyone come between you and success. ,taurus,The restrictions you have been laboring under in recent days will fade over the next 24 hours. Your attitude will be more positive too, giving you a greater sense of freedom and making it much easier to take control of your own destiny. ,taurus,If you want to get ahead in the world then you are going to have to be a bit less thin-skinned. The kind of people who can make things happen for you are not the kind of people who worry about whose egos they might bruise, so toughen up.
taurus,If you feel the need to apologize for something you did that was wrong now is the time. And if someone apologizes to you for something they should not have done be gracious and tell them it really doesn’t matter.
taurus,You must not skirt around the main issue over the next few days. Work colleagues and loved ones alike will be more impressed if you tell the truth, even if what you have to say is not what they want to hear.
taurus,You won’t find it difficult to get your own way today but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you think you are better than them. Most likely you are but you know how touchy some people get, so be subtle.
taurus,The next 24 hours will be hectic to say the least. If you find yourself rushing all over the place but not actually getting much done maybe you should take that as a sign that you have lost control of the situation. Slow down a bit. ,taurus,Try not to be too open about what you think today or you may let slip something that could be used against you by your rivals. Your plans are your plans alone – you don’t have to broadcast them to the entire world.
taurus,Go with the flow, even though you may not be able to see where it is taking you. What happens over the next few days may be unsettling but the planets promise you will do very well out of the changes that take place. ,taurus,You will help those who need it today but there is a danger that you will rescue someone who not only does not deserve it but will expect you to help them out every time they get in trouble. You may have to be cruel to be kind.
taurus,As the Sun moves into one of the most outgoing and optimistic areas of your chart this weekend you can expect a lot of remarkable things to happen. If you feel you would be happier in a different environment, just get up and go.
taurus,A more laid-back approach will work wonders this week. Certain issues may seem important to you now but what will they mean ten or twenty years down the line? Not a lot. Keep things in perspective – and remember to smile.
taurus,You like surprises and that’s just as well because they will be arriving every few minutes over the next couple of days. Be adventurous. Be outrageous. Be the one who makes things happen. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
taurus,Your lust for life is amazing but try not to scatter your energy in too many directions over the next two or three days because it’s unlikely you will be able to maintain the pace for long. Focus on the one thing that matters most to you. ,taurus,A colleague will make you the kind of offer you find hard to refuse today, but can you trust them? Do what you can to find out if it is genuine and, if it is, let them know quickly that you want in on the game. ,taurus,Spend time with the people you love today. Even if you have different ideas of what makes the perfect social occasion you will still enjoy each other’s company. You may even hear some juicy gossip that you were unaware of before. ,taurus,Try not to waste money on things you do not need. It may not bother you now but looking back in a few weeks time you may regret having been so free and easy with your cash. It doesn’t grow on trees you know. ,taurus,If you need assistance with something over the next 48 hours you must ask for it. Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn encourages you to be dynamic but that does not mean you have to do things alone. ,taurus,Your beliefs are likely to change a lot over the next few weeks and soon you will be looking at life from a different angle. Things you never noticed before will suddenly come into focus and the picture you get may surprise you.
taurus,You will have to deal with someone’s negative or emotional attitude over the next 24 hours – while making sure you don’t get negative or emotional yourself. This is one of the best times of the year for you, so don’t let anyone spoil it.
taurus,Taurus people tend to be lucky with cash and investments and if you don’t quite believe that now you will believe it by the end of the week. If you get the chance, go into partnership with someone who complements your style. ,taurus,By all means share your dreams with other people but don’t expect much support. Whatever you say they will find ways to pick holes in it, which won’t do your confidence much good. Dream on but keep your dreams to yourself. ,taurus,Anyone who doubts you have what it takes to succeed will doubt no longer as you go all out to get the new year started in spectacular fashion. Whatever your job or career may be you want that top spot – and you are going to get it. ,taurus,If you feel the need to get up and go somewhere different today then do so. Because the approaching full moon takes place in that area of your chart associated with travel your journey is sure to be exciting – and could be educational too. ,taurus,Venus moves into the career area of your chart today, which means you will get ahead quicker if you treat life as something to be enjoyed rather than as a constant battle. If you’re not smiling then you’re not doing it right. ,taurus,Don’t make too many changes over the next two or three days because you will probably have to change them back again towards the end of the week. It’s not like you to be impulsive, so why start now? ,taurus,You don’t have to apologize for something you said that rubbed a friend or relative up the wrong way. It works both ways: they’ve said plenty of things that annoyed you over the years which you chose not to make an issue of. ,taurus,No matter how big your problems may seem to you now, in the greater scheme of things they are of little importance, so stop worrying and start smiling again. If you can afford the time and money this is a good time to take a vacation. ,taurus,A colleague you thought you could rely on will say something today that makes you realize they are not on your side after all. End the association if you think that’s the right thing to do – and next time don’t be so gullible. ,taurus,Neptune, planet of deception, warns you need to treat what you hear today with the utmost suspicion. That may sound rather negative but according to the planets someone is trying to put ideas in your head that do not belong there.
taurus,You will be dealing with important people today, the kind of people who can make things happen. The trick is to get them to make things happen for you. If you get the chance to impress them, take it. There’s no point being shy. ,taurus,Don’t let anyone take decisions for you this weekend because most likely they will get them wrong and leave you to clear up the mess. If a matter is important to you then you should be prepared to be decisive about it.
taurus,There are some rather wild ideas flying around at the moment, the kind of ideas that could cause trouble if you are foolish enough to act on them. Keep a clear head and keep away from people who are too easily carried away.
taurus,This is a great day for meeting with friends and engaging in activities that make you glad to be alive. On the career front, your ambitions may seem lofty to some but you know that anything is possible if you want it enough – and you do. ,taurus,You will notice someone today who for some reason you never noticed before. Which only goes to show how easy it is to miss things, and people, unless you are actually looking for them. What other things have you overlooked? ,taurus,There are a lot of people out there who could benefit from your brand of kindness, so start looking for ways you can assist them. Charity work would be especially rewarding – it would thrill you to see your efforts help those in need. ,taurus,Don’t worry too much if you fall out with a friend today because it’s really no big deal. It could even be beneficial in that you may need to clear the air and this is as good a time as any. Tomorrow you’ll be best buddies again.
taurus,No matter what sad tales you hear from other people today you will be on a high. As far as you are concerned the world is, was and always will be a wonderful place. Hold on to that feeling as long as you can. ,taurus,What happens over the next 48 hours will in some way change your life. But will it change it for the better or for the worse? That depends on your goals. If you get the choice between making money and helping someone, do the latter. ,taurus,If you are under pressure now it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. Your ambitions will rise dramatically over the next few days but don’t expect too much of yourself too soon – take it a step at a time. ,taurus,You will either impress some very important people today or you will upset some very important people – there is no middle ground. This is a hugely important time for your career and reputation, so get noticed for the right reasons. ,taurus,If you find yourself under pressure today it can only be because you are putting yourself under pressure. You may be intensely ambitious but don’t expect too much too soon. A step at a time will get you where you need to go. ,taurus,You may find it hard getting through to a friend or a family member today but it’s no big deal so don’t worry about it. Chances are they don’t want to hear what you have to say, at least not at the moment, so don’t press it. ,taurus,You may think that a friend is holding out on you in some way, and maybe they are, but is it important? Pretend you have not noticed and let them get away with it. If a small victory makes them happy, let them have it.
taurus,You will get along with people in positions of authority remarkably well today and if you need a favor then now is the time to ask. But don’t let it go to your head – yes, it is possible to ask for too much.
taurus,You will have to deal with someone today who, to put it mildly, rubs you up the wrong way. Be that as it may they have something which you need, so be nice to them, at least until you’ve got what you want! ,taurus,A business matter may cause you some anxiety over the next few days but the planets indicate it’s not worth getting too excited about. Venus, your ruler, moves in your favor on Tuesday, and you may be on the move as well. ,taurus,Be careful what you say today because if you leave any doubt about your meaning someone could take your words the wrong way and cause a scene. Polish up your communication skills – you will need them on the work front. ,taurus,You may have to do something that does not go down well with loved ones today but you know it must be done and will ignore any criticism that comes your way. Sometimes your stubborn streak can be hugely beneficial!,taurus,Don’t let a friendship suffer over a money issue that is of no real importance. It may seem a big deal to you now but in a matter of days you will realize it wasn’t worth the time or the energy you invested in it. ,taurus,Stand up for what you believe in and refuse to change your ways or your views simply to please those in positions of authority. Freedom of speech is a right well worth fighting for, so by all means pick a battle today. ,taurus,The planets are urging you to be open and friendly and show the world you have nothing to hide – even if you actually have plenty to hide! Pretend you don’t have a care in the world and others will be taken in by your act. ,taurus,You have been a bit free and easy with your spending in recent weeks and now would be a good time to cut back and, ideally, find some new sources of income. Don’t wait until you are forced to act – act now. ,taurus,You will get the chance to make friends with someone in a position of power this week. But don’t think you have to flatter them and agree with every word they say. What they like most about you is that you speak your mind. ,taurus,You must put your own needs first over the next few days, not for selfish reasons but because if you don’t you will lose out to people who are not as talented or deserving of success as you. Be bold and be the best.
taurus,You need to get rid of all that emotional junk that is clogging up your life. Be ruthless with yourself – if you let your heart continue to rule your head you won’t get rid of half as much stuff as you should.
taurus,You will take risks purely for the fun of it today, not really caring if you win or lose. The good news is you will win nine times out of ten, and on the one occasion when you do lose it will only be a minor setback. ,taurus,You must tell the truth today, even if it hurts the feelings of people you love. It will hurt them a lot more in the long-term if they discover they were the only ones who did not know what was going on. ,taurus,It might not be a good idea to speak from the heart over the next 24 hours, not with some of the negative opinions you have about certain people. A day or two from now your attitude will be a lot more positive. ,taurus,You will be in a party mood over the next 48 hours. You certainly won’t be too serious about life. People who say you should be working and making money are the kind of people you need most to avoid.
taurus,If you are the kind of Taurus who prefers to stay out of the limelight the next few days could be a bit uncomfortable. Like it or not you are going to be in the spotlight, so maybe you should learn to enjoy the attention.
taurus,The people you will have to deal with today respect facts and figures, so show them your plans and let them know how you can make them work. If they think you know what you are talking about they will support you to the hilt. ,taurus,You have set your heart on doing something and you intend to see it through to the end, no matter what the critics might say. You know what you want and you know how to get it, so what are you waiting for? ,taurus,Others will go out of their way to keep you quiet today, because the truth is not what they want to hear. If you find yourself at odds with people in positions of power, don’t back down. Your have right on your side. ,taurus,Don’t be discouraged if today’s events throw your plans into disarray. One way or another most people around you will be dealing with chaos and confusion over the next 24 hours, so you won’t stand out from the crowd. ,taurus,You will see or hear something to your advantage over the next 24 hours, something that can have a positive effect on your career. What that something may be is impossible to say but you will know it when you see it.
taurus,Most of the time you are a really tough negotiator but today and tomorrow you will go right the other way and let someone have for free what would usually cost them a great deal of money. It’s a one off, of course.
taurus,You may have high ideals but do you live up to them? That is the question you will be asking yourself over the next few days and being the honest sort you will have to admit that sometimes you don’t. But you will in future! ,taurus,Your opinions on a number of issues will change profoundly over the next few days. New information will come your way that makes some of your most cherished convictions look rather out of date. Don’t cling to the past for the sake of it. ,taurus,There are times when it pays to be blunt and this is one of them. Others won’t mind what kind of language you use today so long as they understand where you are coming from and what you expect them to do next. ,taurus,Focus on your dreams and wishes and don’t worry if they seem a bit far-fetched. Today’s new moon makes all things possible, so aim high and, who knows, maybe it won’t be long before your dreams and wishes become realities. ,taurus,This is a good day for thinking but not such a good day for making decisions. Whatever you decide over the next 24 hours you are likely to have second thoughts about it come the weekend, so keep your options open as much as you can.
taurus,If you can’t get what you want over the next 24 hours you will get the chance to make up for it tomorrow. As usual the only thing you have to fear is fear itself, so tell yourself you can do anything you want – and believe it.
taurus,The only danger at the moment is that you will either set your sights too high or set them too low. You need to recognize both what your talents and your limitations happen to be and decide on your goals according to that. ,taurus,Opportunities will come your way over the next few days, so make the effort to get out and about and make things happen. Something you say or do when Venus, your ruler, links with Saturn on Tuesday could make you some serious money. ,taurus,Some people may say you are being too cautious, especially with money, but your sixth sense tells you this is not a good time to splash out. If there is something you really want get a friend or family member to buy it for you. ,taurus,Don’t worry if you find it hard to communicate with those around you over the next 24 hours – it may be the planets’ way of telling you this is not a good time to discuss serious matters. You will open up more later in the week.
taurus,Ignore those you don’t get along with today and spend your time with people whose beliefs are in tune with your own. Group and social activities will go extremely well over the next few days, especially if you stick with your friends. ,taurus,According to the planets you will be taking on a lot more duties and responsibilities over the next few weeks. That may not be what you were hoping to hear but it will, in the long-term, earn you more respect – and more money too.
taurus,You will go out of your way to calm someone down today but your efforts may not be enough. The fact is their emotions are a bit raw at the moment, so make allowances and don’t take what they say about you too seriously.
taurus,Don’t say one thing while meaning another. And don’t give partners and loved ones the impression that you agree with them when you do not. State the truth as you see it and, if others don’t like it, debate the issue in a civilized way.
taurus,You cannot fool people who know you well. With that fact in mind don’t try to tell a partner or loved one something that isn’t true, because they won’t believe you for a moment. You have a reputation for honesty – don’t lose it. ,taurus,Don’t worry if others say you are too conservative and don’t take enough risks. That’s nonsense. You know who you are and what you can do and if you follow your instincts over the coming week you will go much further than your critics. ,taurus,Don’t listen to your own doubts and fears today because they will cloud your mind and prevent you from reaching your true potential. And that would be a shame because there are so many things you could be winning at now.
taurus,Someone will expect you to live up to the inflated image they have of you today but if you try you may come unstuck. Be who you are and do what you do and insist that everyone you know takes you as they find you.
taurus,Chances are you will totally and utterly disagree with the advice you are given today. You could be right – maybe it is a complete load of nonsense – but what if it isn’t and you are the only one who doesn’t act on it?,taurus,If someone gives you a hard time today don’t take it to heart: most likely they just need to let off steam and you happen to be the closest target. If you stay calm and in control they will make it up to you big time tomorrow.
taurus,You have so much energy at your disposal right now that you could do a dozen things at once and still leave something in reserve. However, if you hold fire and wait until Monday or Tuesday you will discover a goal more worthy of your talents.
taurus,You may feel sorry for someone who is going through hard times but, of course, they have only themselves to blame. Help them out by all means but let them know too that sooner or later they are going to have to get their act together.
taurus,Don’t take someone’s negative remarks to heart because either they don’t mean what they say or they don’t realize how offensive it sounds to you. The last thing you need now is a slanging match with someone who should be your friend. ,taurus,The answers you seek are easy to find but you need to ask the right questions too. Take a look at the world around you. Who is in charge? Who is calling the shots? Answer that and everything else will fall into place.
taurus,There is someone you are desperate to get to know better but can’t think of a way to make your approach. Don’t worry. What happens today will throw you together and before you know it you will be more than just friends.
taurus,Take a long hard look at your financial position and decide what steps need to be taken to improve your long-term security. Earning more money would help, of course, but your main priority now is to cut back on luxuries and unnecessary expenses.
taurus,What you expect to happen today and over the weekend most likely won’t, while what you don’t expect to happen most likely will. In which case there is no point making plans as they are certain to change. Take life as it comes. ,taurus,A work colleague will say something unfriendly today and to say you’re not happy about it is a bit of an understatement. But before you respond in kind make sure you have heard them correctly – it could be you who has the wrong end of the stick.
taurus,You have been moving in the wrong direction and realize you will have to backtrack and find the point where you strayed off the path you were supposed to go down. On the other hand, some say all roads lead eventually to the same destination! ,taurus,You may be eager to push ahead with a project you know in your bones will be a success but the planets warn the timing is not quite right. At the very least wait until the solar eclipse on Friday – it will give you the boost you need. ,taurus,Promise yourself that you won’t get annoyed if certain people get on your nerves over the next few days. Most likely the real problem isn’t them but you and the closer you get to Friday’s eclipse the more sensitive you will be.
taurus,Everyone has faults, everyone has failings, but not everyone has the strength to deal with them. But you do. The planets make it easy to confront the negative aspects of your personality now, so face up to them and overcome them.
taurus,Friends and family are both on your mind at the moment but they are unlikely to mix, so focus on one and catch up on the other later on. The last thing you want over the next few days is a clash of personalities to deal with. ,taurus,If someone blames you for something that was not your fault by all means let them know you are not happy about it, but don’t go to extremes and make an enemy of them. Think before you speak – it could save you a lot of bother. ,taurus,You feel that your ideas are not being taken seriously but don’t worry because you will get the chance to prove yourself in weeks to come. This weekend though, keep telling yourself that you are on the right track – because you are. ,taurus,While everyone else is rushing here, there and everywhere trying to get things done today you will be strolling along without a care in the world. Either you have missed something important or maybe you’re the only one with the right attitude. ,taurus,There seems to be a lot of self doubt in your mind, which is not like you at all. Prove to yourself that you have what it takes to succeed by taking the sort of risk you would usually avoid. Take a chance – and be a star. ,taurus,Venus in your sign means you can get almost anything you want – and if you don’t believe that now you will before the day is over. However, go easy with the cash and the cards because you are also in one of your spendthrift moods.
taurus,Venus in your sign makes the world look a kinder place, but don’t be fooled. Your attitude to those around you may have softened but you still need to take care, especially when dealing with money-related issues. Don’t be an easy touch. ,taurus,It is slowly but surely all coming right for you and over the next few days you will benefit in ways you cannot yet imagine. With Venus, your ruler, moving through your birth sign you cannot possibly lose, in love or in luck.
taurus,Forget about financial matters and focus on your family. Get things in perspective today and remind yourself that, in the greater scheme of things, money is only bits of paper. Your own flesh and blood is, and always will be, more important.
taurus,Don’t worry if a loved one is difficult to get along with this weekend – most likely they are going through a period of self-doubt and there is nothing much you can do about it. Give them space. They will get over it soon.
taurus,However much you don’t feel like getting stuck into your workload you know if you don’t make a start now it may never get done. Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely – make sure they like what they see.
taurus,You are trying to make sense of something that makes no sense at all, so it is no wonder you are getting frustrated. You don’t need to find an explanation for everything that happens in life. Some puzzles are best left unsolved. ,taurus,What happens today should be seen as the culmination of all the efforts you have made over the past few months. And even if you have not made much of an effort something will happen that brings a smile to your face. ,taurus,The pace of life will pick up over the next few days and that’s good news because you have been operating well below capacity. With Mars in your sign you will find it ridiculously easy to get things done – but get others to help you too.
taurus,You will say the right thing in the right way today, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. However, you don’t need to boast about how good you are. If they don’t know already they will learn over the next few days.
taurus,What is the one thing you desire above everything else? If you know what it is and if you have the confidence to go after it there is every chance you will get it over the next few days. But only you can make it happen.
taurus,You may not be getting the support and encouragement you need at the moment but don’t worry about it. It simply means that those you live and work with have a lot on their minds this weekend. Maybe you should be supporting them.
taurus,The last few days have been hectic and if you are smart you will now slow down a bit and make sure your physical, metal and emotional batteries are recharged. If you don’t it won’t be long before you are showing signs of fatigue. ,taurus,The less others know about your aims and ambitions this week the better, especially if you are working towards a goal that is likely to make others jealous if you succeed – and you will. The less your rivals know about it the better.
taurus,You may be tempted to give up on something that is not working out the way you expected but is that wise? The planets urge you to stick with it a while longer because a breakthrough is imminent. If you give up now you will regret it later.
taurus,Try not to change things for the sake of it over the next 24 hours. According to the planets you are thinking of altering something simply because others have been criticizing you for being too traditional. They’re right, you are – but so what?,taurus,Either you will set your sights too high or set them too low over the next 24 hours. You could, of course, surprise everyone and find a sensible middle way but how likely is that? You’re in one of your “take it to the limit” moods!,taurus,If you have a good idea today you must let others know about it, especially those who can support you and guide you. Don’t keep your biggest and best ideas to yourself: sharing what you know is always good business. ,taurus,Changing methods and routines is rarely easy but the current cosmic outlook makes it simpler than usual, for you at least. Whatever changes you think are necessary you should get on with them now. There’s no time like the present.
taurus,Don’t worry too much if something happens over the next few days that throws your plans into disarray. Everyone around you will be dealing with chaos and confusion. The good news is that you will deal with it better than most.
taurus,The Sun in Aries at this time of year tends to bring forth self-doubt but the good news is that the Sun will be moving into your sign in a week’s time and then your confidence will return. Between now and then, keep a low profile. ,taurus,You are in no mood to follow the herd. With mind planet Mercury moving into your sign you will go your own way and do your own thing even if the whole world is against you. You’ll make a big impression, and a good one too.
taurus,You have been worrying too much about money and business matters lately but as from today your fears should subside a little. The moment you stop worrying about your cash flow situation is the moment it will start getting better.
taurus,A few days from now the Sun will move into your birth sign and a new solar year will begin, so try not to start anything new. Conserve your energy today and over the weekend – because you are going to need it very soon. ,taurus,The Sun remains in the most introspective area of your chart only until Monday, so put aside some time over the next 48 hours for quiet contemplation and to consider your options. It could be the most important weekend of the year.
taurus,It’s not often you splash out on gifts for other people but with the Sun moving into your sign today you are in an optimistic, and therefore generous, mood. Don’t go too mad though – your resources are limited after all.
taurus,It’s time to finish those tasks that should have been completed a long time ago. The Sun in your sign means your energy levels will peak over the next few days, so get on top of your workload so you can stop worrying about it.
taurus,You will have plenty to say for yourself today and as far as some people are concerned you are saying too much. But that’s too bad because you have kept your thoughts to yourself long enough – now you intend to make up for lost time.
taurus,With the Sun in your sign your confidence is high but you still have a vague feeling that everything could fall apart at any moment. Don’t worry, it won’t, but it could be your intuition is trying to tell you something. What could it be?,taurus,If you are happy with your life as it is then don’t change a thing, no matter how hard others try to persuade you to set new goals. You are at your best when you know where you stand. Security is more important to you than ambition. ,taurus,You may be the life and soul of the party at the moment but some of the people you interact with this weekend won’t be in the mood for fun and games. Don’t get in their way but don’t let them get in your way either. ,taurus,All things are possible for you now but for best results you should focus on just one or two aims. If you spread yourself too thin your energy and enthusiasm will be used up quickly and your excitement will wane quickly too. ,taurus,There will be a clash of egos as the new week begins and although you won’t be directly involved you will be affected. Under no circumstances agree to take sides, because even if you choose right you will lose out in some way.
taurus,You are full of energy and enthusiasm now but that does not mean you should throw caution to the wind. By all means be bold today but have a goal too, something you can work towards, if only by indirect means.
taurus,Let your mind roam where it will over the next 24 hours. Give yourself permission to dream. The dreams you have may seem far-fetched to some but chances are it won’t be long before they are no longer dreams but realities.
taurus,You have come a long way in a short space of time and will go even further over the next few weeks. But first you must slow down a bit and make sure you are still on the right track. Don’t lose sight of your long-term goals.
taurus,The more others try to change your way of looking at things the more you will dig in your heels, and you are right to resist. Only you know what is best for you and your instincts tell you this is a time for consolidation, not change.
taurus,Try not to take what you hear to heart over the next 48 hours. It may be true that someone is trying to make you feel bad – most likely because it makes them feel good – but you are under no obligation to play their silly games.
taurus,Make your plans and make them big – but keep them secret too. If you are too eager to show the world how smart you are then you might let slip something that boosts your rivals’ chances of success at the expense of your own. ,taurus,Strive to be nice to people today, even if they are not always nice to you. A full moon in your opposite sign of Scorpio will help you realize that people everywhere are much the same – if not quite as brilliant as you. ,taurus,Some people think you are lazy but that’s far from the truth. It’s just that you see no point exerting yourself for things that are of no importance. It’s better to be ambitious about one thing than lukewarm about many things.
taurus,You will get the chance to climb several rungs up the ladder of success over the next few days but there is also a danger that you could slip and fall all the way to the bottom. It’s all part of the game – smile whatever happens. ,taurus,Do something different over the next 24 hours, something that those who believe you are traditional by nature would never guess you are capable of. The fact is you have been far too predictable of late. It’s time to get yourself noticed.
taurus,Make the most of Mars in your sign to get things done and let the people you live and work with know that you won’t be pushed around. You don’t have to be aggressive about it but you do have to protect your interests.
taurus,You could easily go over the top and make claims or statements you don’t know to be true over the next 48 hours. You may think that does not matter but the planets warn it could cost you dear, so watch what you say.
taurus,Over the next few days you will find that some things that usually come easy to you will need extra care and extra effort. Most importantly you must take care with money as impulse buying could lead you astray in a big and costly way. ,taurus,Mars leaves your birth sign tomorrow, so if there is anything that needs finishing you should knuckle down and get on with it now. Your efforts will not go unrecognized or unrewarded – the powers that be have been watching. ,taurus,Mars leaves your sign today but that does not mean you can no longer be positive. On the contrary, in some areas you can be even more positive than usual. Material issues generally and money matters in particular are doubly important now.
taurus,You could easily spend too much money today and in doing so damage your reputation for thrift and common sense. Just because others are throwing their cash around does not mean you have to as well. Keep your wallet in your pocket.
taurus,It may seem as if time is running out, that if you don’t start something now the opportunity will pass you by. Common sense should tell you that simply isn’t true. You will always get another chance, so take your time and get it right.
taurus,You must be decisive today. You must draw up a plan and follow it through to completion. Ignore those who say you are wrong and deal firmly with those who get in your way. Be ruthless if you have to – there’s a lot at stake.
taurus,Turn your hand to something out of the ordinary over the next 48 hours. and show the world what a talented individual you are. Venus, your ruler, gives you the ability to know want is tasteful and what will sell. Combine the two.
taurus,The Sun in your sign is amplified in power by tomorrow’s new moon, so whatever you do over the next couple of days stands an excellent chance of success. Does that get you thinking? Does that get you planning? It should. ,taurus,Don’t get too emotional today. A new moon in your sign suggests you will get involved in something that means so much to you that you put your body and soul into it. Which is fine but remember you only have one of each! ,taurus,Like it or not, you will have to work closely with people you would probably prefer to avoid over the next 24 hours. But don’t worry, it won’t be too much of an ordeal and come this time tomorrow you will be saying your good-byes.
taurus,If there is something you have left unfinished, then get on with it today and get it out of the way once and for all. When the Sun leaves your birth sign tomorrow you will have more important things to worry about, so do it now.
taurus,It might be a good idea not to make any money-related decisions for the time being. The Sun’s move into the financial area of your chart will show you ways to boost your income but don’t go at it too quickly – there’s no rush.
taurus,Yes, you appear to have a very thick skin but the fact is you are as easily upset as anyone else and what someone says today may hurt you immensely. That’s not what they meant though, so don’t take it seriously and try to forgive them.
taurus,Almost certainly you will overdo it and go too far this weekend but will you care? Of course not. This is one of those occasions when, as far as you are concerned, you cannot go far enough. Have as much fun as is humanly possible. ,taurus,Whatever challenges or obstacles you face over the next few days you will find ways to overcome them. You could even turn them to your advantage. Any of your rivals who believe you will be easy to beat are in for a serious shock.
taurus,You will find it easy to be assertive over the next few days and that’s good because you need to push your own interests more forcefully. But don’t waste time trying to convert people to your point of view: it won’t work and it’s not necessary.
taurus,If someone is critical of you today there can only be one reason: they are jealous of your popularity and success. The more they say that you are doing something wrong the more you can be sure you are doing it right. ,taurus,Play to your strengths. Focus on the things you are good at. If someone asks you to do something that you doubt will work out well then turn them down flat. You like a challenge but you like a challenge you can master better.
taurus,You can turn a minor success into a major triumph today, simply by letting others help you complete what you started. Don’t let pride of creation or ownership stop you from sharing your good ideas and good works – there is plenty to go around.
taurus,Focus on what comes easy to you and resist calls to get involved in things you know little about. You are at your best when you feel you are in control, and while others may say that is boring you really don’t mind. Boring pays the bills.
taurus,A friend will make what sounds like a reasonable suggestion this weekend, but if you act on what they tell you there is a very good chance you will regret it. Maybe they are trying to trick you – or maybe they have been tricked themselves.
taurus,Half-hearted efforts will not be enough this week – in fact they are likely to get you into trouble. Focus on your number one responsibility and put everything into it until you have completed it. A job well done will bring huge rewards. ,taurus,Life isn’t as tough as you seem to think it is. According to the planets you have everything you need to realize your dreams, accomplish your ambitions and find peace and contentment both in your personal life and in your career. ,taurus,You are never afraid to try something new but the full moon in wayward Sagittarius warns you would be wise to be a bit more cautious over the next few days. Take a risk if you must, but make it a calculated risk, not a stupid one.
taurus,A battle of wills is likely today but because it is a battle that neither side can win you are advised not to take it too seriously. Speak your mind by all means but don’t waste time and energy trying to get others to change theirs.
taurus,According to the planets you will surprise a few people with your tough guy act today. Usually you are placid in the extreme and rarely raise your voice but over the next 24 hours you will go right the other way. Scream and shout! ,taurus,You may be tempted to work harder than ever but the planets indicate it would be better if you took the opposite approach. Slow down and don’t take life so seriously. Except for the love of your family, of course: take that very seriously indeed.
taurus,You may have to get tough and refuse to help someone you have helped on numerous occasions in the past. There comes a time when even a kindly soul such as yourself has to say enough is enough, and that time is now. ,taurus,Everyone else may be rushing in all directions at the moment but you know what you want and you know where to get it. The general chaos may even help you as it makes it harder for your rivals to work out what you are up to.
taurus,You can see which way the wind is blowing but will you be flexible enough to bend with the breeze? If you are true to your Taurus nature and refuse to budge even an inch you may find that breeze turns into a hurricane. ,taurus,It’s likely you are not your usual happy-go-lucky self at the moment and those around you have noticed the difference. Friends and colleagues will try to cheer you up today and before you know it you will be all smiles again.
taurus,If you receive a financial offer of some sort today you must make up your mind about it straight away. If you leave it until tomorrow chances are it won’t be there any more, so say Yes or say No but say something!,taurus,Forget about material things and focus on the fun side of life. Yes, of course, making money can be fun too but there are even better things you could be doing today. Someone you care for deeply needs some tender loving care.
taurus,Most of the time you are super confident but something will knock you out of your stride today and make you think you have bitten off more than you can chew. In the greater scheme of things it’s no big deal, so don’t fret.
taurus,It might be wise to wait a while before making any new plans as things will move quickly, and in strange directions, over the next two or three days. Try not to worry though – everything will work out for the best in the end.
taurus,As Saturn moves into the relationship area of your chart tomorrow you may find that you don’t get along so well with people you are close to and that will, of course, cause concern. All it means is you still have a few differences to resolve.
taurus,You may find that your enthusiasm takes a bit of a dive over the next few days but it is nothing to worry about. You are going through a period of readjustment and come the weekend you will be raring to go again.
taurus,You need to find a solution to a problem that has been annoying you for too long. Most likely it has something to do with money and most likely you know what to do but have not yet found the courage to take action. Find it now.
taurus,If you take a chance today you could hit the jackpot. There are no guarantees but the planets promise if you have done your homework and planned things carefully you could easily be on a winner. Make sure you win for yourself though.
taurus,In just a few days your view of the world will change for the better and your current negative attitude will fade away. Focus on the many good things in your life rather than the few things that have gone wrong. Your thoughts create your reality.
taurus,You have no choice but to admit that you have wasted a lot of money for no good reason. But don’t be too hard on yourself because in a matter of days you will be having the kind of fun that money can’t buy.
taurus,As the Sun moves into the area of your chart that governs travel plans and social activities tomorrow the only effort you have to make today is to lighten up. You have been far too serious in recent weeks. It’s time to smile more.
taurus,Whatever your duties and commitments may be you must find time to do the things you enjoy. Creative and artistic activities, as well as affairs of heart, are well starred over the coming week, so let your hair down and have fun.
taurus,You may not be in a sociable mood at the moment but if you make an effort and talk to the people you meet you will discover something to your benefit. You may also discover that some people are smarter than you expected. ,taurus,If you want to break free of certain restrictions now would be a good time to get your act together and give it a go. You may not succeed at first but you will gain insights that make success more likely the next time you make the attempt.
taurus,Something fortunate will happen over the next 24 hours but you may not realize how fantastic it is for a while. If someone you meet while on your travels gives you advice you should take it – they know what they are talking about.
taurus,You may not be the type to watch what you say but the planets warn this is not a good time to upset people for the sake of it. The closer you get to the weekend the more you need to watch your choice of words. ,taurus,Over the next few days it will become increasingly obvious that the world has moved and you must move with it. Taurus may at times be an inflexible sign but even you know the old way of doing things has had its day. Join the modern world.
taurus,You may be incredibly ambitious but you don’t have to fight your way to the top, not with Venus, planet of harmony, as your ruling planet. Find ways to persuade employers and other important people that you are worthy of better things.
taurus,Thursday’s full moon in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn means you will find it easier than most to deal with any negative emotions that might arise over the next few days. However, take extra care when traveling because accidents could easily occur. ,taurus,You may find it easy to point the finger at other people but before you do make sure there are no skeletons in your own closet that might be dragged out for the world to see. No one is perfect – no, not even a Taurus! ,taurus,Although you are generally quite placid there are times when you go right the other way and give vent to your feelings and this is likely to be one of them. Those negative emotions that have been building up must be dealt with. ,taurus,You will go out of your way to help other people today. However, it would be wise to remember that some individuals get themselves in trouble on purpose, simply because they like being rescued. Don’t waste your time on fools.
taurus,You are free to speak your mind no matter who it might offend. Some may say that certain words and phrases are out of bounds but you must treat anyone who tries to impose their speech code on you to a few choice words of your own. ,taurus,A more light-hearted phase will begin on Wednesday when Mercury, planet of the mind, moves in your favor. You may have to endure a few sleepless nights, but only because you are so busy partying and chasing your dream.
taurus,This is the ideal time to throw out all the emotional junk you have acquired during the first half of the year. Today’s Sun-Pluto link will encourage you to be ruthless with yourself. In short, you know it’s time to grow up.
taurus,Life may be fun at the moment but you still need to tighten your belt and not waste money on things you don’t really need. You may be expecting to come into some cash very soon but don’t spend it before it has actually arrived. ,taurus,The only thing that matters today is that you follow your instincts and follow to the letter what your inner voice tells you. Even if the whole world says you are mad you must not change direction. You’re right, they’re wrong.
taurus,You are taking something far too seriously and at the same time neglecting far more important issues. What happens over the next 24 hours will help you see things in perspective and remind you that life is too short to waste time on worry.
taurus,Saturn in your opposite sign of Scorpio urges you to face up to problems in your most important relationships. Most importantly, you need to bring certain resentments into the open where they can be dealt with once and for all.
taurus,You are in no mood for chit-chat and anyone who wastes your time with silly gossip will be told to keep quiet. You intend to stay focused on what’s important to you, and if that annoys some people, well, too bad. They’ll get over it.
taurus,The planets indicate that if you are bold over the coming week you will make some kind of breakthrough, even though your opponents may be powerful. Have faith in your abilities and take that big leap into the unknown.
taurus,You simply don’t care if some of the things you say offend other people – in fact you want it to happen. According to the planets you will choose your words for maximum impact today. More than one person will fall over in shock.
taurus,Friends and relatives will do anything to assist you today, so don’t pretend that everything in your life is fine and dandy because it isn’t and you need their help. Even a Taurus can find themselves out of their depth once in a while.
taurus,Be wary of people who say they have only your interests at heart. With both Mars and Mercury at odds with Pluto today you cannot afford to take chances. If you do, and get it wrong, it may be a long time before you trust anyone again.
taurus,You need to come out of your shell and remind the world that you exist. Don’t limit yourself to the tried and tested: the more you experiment the more likely it is you will find what you are looking for – and others will value your worth.
taurus,Your reputation seems to be heading south in some people’s eyes. What have you done to turn them against you? Probably no more than to tell the truth about something they feel strongly about. Some people would rather live with illusions than face up to reality.
taurus,You are on the cusp of one of the most rewarding and romantic periods of the year. The entry of Venus, planet of love and also your ruler, into the sympathetic sign of Virgo this weekend will bring affairs of the heart to the fore.
taurus,You will face not one but several challenges over the next few days but that’s okay – in fact it’s good. More than anything you need to find out why certain people are suddenly so hard to get along with. Maybe they feel you have been neglecting them. ,taurus,You have been so busy of late that someone is beginning to think you have forgotten about them. It isn’t remotely true and you should do something today that convinces them of that fact. You will soon be back in their good books. ,taurus,Your confidence may be sky-high at the moment but you are advised not to take too much for granted, because what you gain through confidence over the next 24 hours could so easily be lost through over-confidence later in the week. ,taurus,Don’t worry if you failed to live up to an ideal of some kind. At least you have ideals, which is more than most people can claim. Keep plugging away and sooner or later you will make the breakthrough you have been dreaming about.
taurus,You feel out of touch with what is going on around you. Others seem to be enthralled by events that mean nothing to you. The fact is you are not missing much. Go your own way and do your own thing – you will be better off for it. ,taurus,You have a knack for knowing what other people are thinking and it will come in useful this weekend. You will know in an instant if you are being told the truth or if you are being lied to. Woe betide those who take you for a fool. ,taurus,You have a knack for knowing what other people are thinking and it will come in useful this weekend. You will know in an instant if you are being told the truth or if you are being lied to. Woe betide those who take you for a fool. ,taurus,There are a lot of challenges coming your way and, yes, you feel a bit apprehensive. But the planets suggest that you will come through unscathed and that you will turn even the most testing of challenges into triumphs. Somehow you always do.
taurus,Good fortune of one sort or another is heading your way and family and finances are especially well starred over the next few days. Everyone will marvel at your ability to get things done, with apparently the least amount of effort.
taurus,The one thing you most want to avoid is the one thing you must face up to today. Something that has been causing you a great deal of worry can now be dealt with but it will take a lot of courage on your part.
taurus,Because Friday’s full moon takes place in the career area of your chart there are likely to be challenges of one sort or another over the next few days. Someone in a position of power is watching you closely – make sure they like what they see. ,taurus,You find it hard to be modest, and with good reason, but today you would be wise not to draw attention to your superiority because the planets warn there is something you have missed, and that something could make you look very silly.
taurus,You may be tempted to walk away from certain responsibilities today but you know it is not the right thing to do. However tough your tasks and duties may be it is essential that you see them through to the end. Are they really such a burden?,taurus,Try not to be so distant emotionally. It is sometimes difficult for even those closest to a Taurus to know what their true feelings are but over the next 48 hours you will find it easy to be more open and loving. Let’s hope it lasts.
taurus,Whatever you do over the coming week will be a resounding success. It will be even more of a success if you don’t worry too much about how much it is going to cost. However much you spend your wallet will be miraculously replenished. ,taurus,According to the planets you are looking in every direction but the one you really want to go. Maybe you don’t want others to guess what you are planning but if you try too hard you may make it obvious that you are up to something. ,taurus,If you made an error of some kind recently then now is the time to stand up and admit it. Loved ones won’t think any the less of you, in fact they will be impressed by your courage – so few ever admit to getting it wrong.
taurus,You won’t pull your punches when telling others what you think of them today. However, the planets warn you could be too honest for your own good. Be truthful about their good points, but play down their bad points if possible.
taurus,You have made plenty of sacrifices in recent weeks and now it is time to do something for yourself. Today’s Venus-Mercury link means it won’t be long before you feel more positive about your dreams and your place in the world.
taurus,What happens today and over the weekend is likely to throw some of your cozy assumptions into disarray. It may be a painful experience but it is also a useful one, especially if it inspires you to see things from a different point of view.
taurus,You may feel a bit insecure today but try to make it look as if you don’t have a care in the world. You should also confide in those you love and trust, because they can give you the security you need – if they know something is wrong.
taurus,Don’t even think about putting duty before pleasure over the next few days. As Jupiter moves into the area of our chart that governs artistic activities and affairs of the heart on Tuesday your number one aim must be to have fun.
taurus,You may find it hard to get along with certain people today but it’s no big deal. Rather than risk saying something you may later regret just remove yourself from their presence for a while. This is only a passing phase.
taurus,If you rely too much on other people now you will no doubt regret it later on when you discover that they don’t know what they are talking about. Sometimes you can be a bit too easygoing and a bit too trusting. You need to wise up.
taurus,The last thing you want now is to waste time and energy trying to persuade other people to see things and do things your way. It’s what YOU do that counts, so do something creative, something that makes the world sit up and take notice. ,taurus,The less you reveal about your true intentions today the better. With mind planet Mercury at odds with deceptive Neptune you might be tempted to brag a little about your plans but if you do you are likely to regret it. Keep them to yourself.
taurus,You may be a bit irritable with certain people, and no doubt with good reason, but try not to let it get to you. Forget about the little things and focus on the bigger picture. Petty people and petty annoyances are not worth the time or the effort.
taurus,Don’t be afraid to take a few risks this weekend. You may be a bit fearful that what you would like to do could meet with disapproval from loved ones but there is no need to worry: think and act positive and they will be positive too.
taurus,Jupiter in the most dynamic area of your chart makes this a great time for you, and if you don’t quite believe that now you will believe it by the end of the week. There will be no stopping you creatively or romantically. No goal is beyond you. ,taurus,You will be put to the test this week but you will, of course, pass with flying colors. No matter how big the challenge you are big enough to meet it. You were born to lead and you were born to succeed and you will do both brilliantly.
taurus,Jupiter in the most creative area of your chart makes it easy for you to think big but some of your ideas may be a bit out of touch with reality. Nothing bad will happen so long as you limit yourself to just thinking. Doing could be costly!,taurus,You will encounter the kind of problem that would knock lesser mortals for six. But you are not a lesser mortal, you are a Taurus, and you will find a way to handle it. Actually, it’s not really much of a problem at all, at least not for you.
taurus,Is it possible to have too much of a good thing? No way! The planets indicate that friends and family members will give you everything you desire today, plus a few things you did not know you desired. It rarely gets better than this. ,taurus,What you see and hear over the next 24 hours may shock you but there is no point getting upset or angry. Other people’s actions may not be to your liking but, for the moment at least, there is not much you can do about it.
taurus,Start doing what you want to do, as opposed to what others expect you to do. The Sun in Virgo over the next few weeks will make it easy for you to be creative and romantic. A little of what you fancy will do you good.
taurus,You are working too hard and need to find ways to relax. That does not mean you have to stop striving altogether but it does mean you should alternate periods of effort with periods of rest. Focus on a hobby or something else that interests you.
taurus,You are dwelling on what is going wrong in the world instead of on what is going right, so it’s no wonder you are unhappy. Cosmic activity in the most easygoing area of your chart demands that you worry less, smile more and take life as it comes. ,taurus,Try not to take anything or anyone too seriously over the next 24 hours. If you find yourself thinking about one thing to the exclusion of everything else that is a sure sign you have become infatuated about something and that isn’t healthy.
taurus,There may be no such thing as a perfect day but with the Sun linked to Jupiter in the most dynamic area of your chart today will come close. Personally, professionally, romantically and financially you are on a roll – keep it going. ,taurus,If you feel like doing something different today just get on and do it and worry about the consequences later. If you seek advice from friends and colleagues you can bet they will tell you to forget all about it – so don’t ask. ,taurus,You are not usually the sort to have doubts but you may hesitate to do something which, at most other times, you would give no thought to at all. The good news is that your indecision will in a strange way work in your favor.
taurus,Once you have decided on a certain course of action you go all the way, which is why you are so successful, but the planets warn you need to make sure that what you are planning is both possible and desirable. Have you really thought things through?,taurus,You may be only 90 per cent certain that what you are doing is right but that is enough. There are few areas in life where we can be absolutely sure of ourselves and if you wait for one of them to come around you could wait forever. ,taurus,No matter how hard you try to get along with someone it never seems to work. Isn’t it about time you got the message and severed your links with them entirely? Okay, if you must, give it one last go today but, after that, call it a day. ,taurus,Sometimes you are afraid to act in case you make a fool of yourself but today you will go to the other extreme and take the kind of risks you usually go out of your way to avoid. Your newfound confidence will pay off big time.
taurus,Let fate take its course and don’t take anything too seriously. If you let yourself get annoyed too easily you will look back later in the month and realize how much time and energy you wasted on things that don’t matter in the slightest.
taurus,You sometimes like to play favorites but the current cosmic set-up is urging you to be more even-handed in your approach to life in general and to people you deal with on a one-to-one basis in particular. Treat everyone with the same courtesy.
taurus,Every suggestion you make lately seems to be met with disapproval by those you live and work with. It may be hugely frustrating but you won’t change their attitude, so you might as well go off by yourself and do your own thing.
taurus,You will be brimming over with self-belief this weekend. A stunning Sun-Pluto link will bring out your dominant side, so if there is something you want you will find a way to get it. Others would be wise just to give it to you! ,taurus,Jupiter in the most dynamic area of your chart does wonders for your confidence but it also makes you a touch selfish. Try not to think only of yourself. Focus on the needs of loved ones and recognize that their desires are as valid as your own.
taurus,Try not to be too pushy over the next few days, because the people you live and work with won’t take kindly to anyone who tries to tell them what to do. If you want to get things done you must take their views and opinions into account.
taurus,Some people will tell you that changes you made on the home front should now be changed back again but don’t let them persuade you. No matter how much you had to leave in the past you can already see that the future is more exciting. ,taurus,Why are you feeling so guilty about all the fun you have been having of late? Most likely it is because of those tales of woe you keep hearing from people who have not had it so good. Yes, life is unfair. Too bad. ,taurus,Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Virgo will make it easy for you to take the kind of risks you often dream about but rarely have the nerve to try. Be your own boss and do your own thing – and reap the considerable rewards.
taurus,No, you must not start slowing down. The approaching solar eclipse will bring you all sorts of new opportunities and this could turn out to be one of the best times of the year, so set your sights high and push yourself even harder than before. ,taurus,You need to do more with your talents. No matter how laid-back a Taurus you happen to be you must push yourself harder over the coming six months. You may be a Bull by nature but no way are you just one of the herd. Be different.
taurus,Forget about the little things that go wrong occasionally because the big things are all going right for you now. This is one of the best times of the year to remind the world that you are special and deserve to be treated with love and respect.
taurus,Something you say may seem obvious to you but other people may struggle to understand what you are talking about. Try to see things from their point of view, then explain what’s going on in plain and simple language.
taurus,An opportunity to improve a partnership or relationship could easily be missed. Focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Career issues and money matters may seem important but in the greater scheme of things they don’t count for much. ,taurus,The Sun in Virgo endows you not only with a positive outlook but also a willingness to take risks. Something you begin over the next few days could change your life in remarkable ways, so stop dithering and start living the dream.
taurus,It does not matter what threats you make today a work colleague will move at their own speed – and that’s dead slow. Don’t bother losing your temper as it will just encourage them to dig in their heels even more. Grit your teeth and bear it.
taurus,You are enjoying life at the moment but you sense that you will soon have to turn your attention to more serious matters. Pay more attention to your health this weekend. It may be time for a new diet or fitness regime.
taurus,You know what you want and you know how to get it but don’t push too hard. Your confidence may be high at the moment but confidence alone may not be enough. The planets warn it will pay you to take things slowly for a day or two. ,taurus,You have been in tune with the spirit of the times of late but all good things must end and later in the week things could get a bit confusing. Today though you decide what is the most fun thing you could be doing – and just do it.
taurus,You may find it difficult to put into words what is in your head but that’s okay. Your body language will tell others what they need to hear, not least of which is that you have no time for slackers who don’t pull their weight.
taurus,Certain habits and routines are past their sell-by date and must be replaced. The Sun’s change of signs will make it easy for you to get rid of the old and bring in the new over the next few days. Don’t wait, get on with it! ,taurus,You need to focus on the small print now to make sure you are getting a good deal. You will have no one to blame but yourself if you overlook some apparently minor fact or figure and end up missing out on a major opportunity.
taurus,Be careful how hard you push yourself today because even though Mars, planet of energy, moves in your favor there is a possibility you might strain yourself if you take on too much. Know what your limits are and make sure you stay within them. ,taurus,What happens around the time of Monday’s eclipse will determine whether your dreams come true or whether you have to admit that you aimed too high. If you get a chance to prove yourself don’t hesitate for even a second: go for gold! ,taurus,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart will disrupt your emotional balance and make you believe that certain people are picking on you. Maybe they are but don’t get uptight about it. What can they do to actually harm you? ,taurus,Common sense will clash with ambition today. Which one will win? Who knows! Be careful that your words and actions do not create resentment among partners and colleagues as it could cause serious problems a little further down the road.
taurus,This could be and should be one of the most rewarding periods of the year for you but to make the most of it you need to be more active and adventurous. Mars and Jupiter are very much on your side, so take a few chances.
taurus,There may be times over the next few days when you are tempted to retreat from the world but that would be a mistake. Ignoring your problems now is sure to make them worse in the long-term, so get out there and fight. ,taurus,Someone will go out of their way to do things for you today, which makes you suspicious. What are they after? What’s in it for them? The question you should be asking is: why can’t I just accept that some people are nice by nature?,taurus,Make sure you spend time planning what you are going to do – it will help you to get twice as much done as you would have had you rushed things. The Sun in Libra increases your workload, so you have got to think ahead.
taurus,Little things will upset you more than they should this weekend. What you need to realize is that your mental, emotional and physical wellbeing are all closely linked. Try not to worry about things you cannot change or control.
taurus,This is potentially a lucky time for you, a time when wonderful things happen for no apparent reason. Creatively and romantically this is also the ideal time to start something new. The planets indicate it will be a success. Go for it!,taurus,You may be tempted to get vocal with someone who has let you down but the planets warn that they hold the upper hand at the moment, so don’t expect your words to have much effect. Try criticizing them later in the week instead. ,taurus,You don’t care if what you say offends other people, in fact you quite like it. As far as you are concerned it is the price they pay for avoiding the truth for so long. Choose your words for maximum impact over the next 24 hours. ,taurus,You need to get on top of your workload before it gets on top of you. Shut yourself away from distractions and tackle each task that has to be done with energy and enthusiasm. But don’t stop there – get as far ahead as possible. ,taurus,This may be an enjoyable time but don’t waste your precious energy on people and situations that bring you no benefit. Your main priority now is to set yourself targets that pay off for you in the long-term, not for others in the short-term. ,taurus,Seize the moment and make things happen. With Mars moving through the most dynamic area of your chart there is plenty of time to do something remarkable. Get your act together and make the world sit up and take notice.
taurus,Don’t try to keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself this weekend because those who know you well will see in an instant what you are trying to hide. Why so reticent? What have you got to be embarrassed about? Nothing at all, most likely. ,taurus,The most important thing over the next seven days is that you strive to stay on good terms with someone whose friendship means a lot to you. Yes, there will be times when you don’t see eye-to-eye but you will still see heart-to-heart. ,taurus,What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so stop worrying that you could have done more or could have done better and get on with your life. The choices you make over the next few days will influence your life for years, so make them wisely. ,taurus,There is a strong possibility that partners, friends and even some of your work colleagues will be opposed to what you want to do today. Of course, being the stubborn Taurus you are that will only make you more determined to do it. ,taurus,You could do worse today than let a friend or family member call the shots. The planets indicate quite strongly that you will gain more by doing less things for yourself. Go on, you’re a Taurus, you like to be spoiled. ,taurus,If someone you live or work with makes a mess of something today don’t make a big fuss about it. There are far too many interesting things going on in the world to waste precious time worrying what others may be doing wrong.
taurus,There is an air of anticipation, as if something dramatic is going to happen. The planets indicate that if you keep your head you will benefit from whatever changes take place. What happens next will surprise most people – but you will enjoy it.
taurus,You will be more emotional than usual this weekend. You will also have the nagging suspicion that you have taken a wrong turning. The good news is it doesn’t matter – it won’t actually make much difference either way, so lighten up. ,taurus,Once the Sun moves into your opposite sign of Scorpio on the 23rd you will be halfway through your solar year, making this a good time to look back and see how far you have come – and how far you still have to go. ,taurus,The planets warn quite strongly that you must watch what you say over the next 24 hours. Not everyone is as good at taking criticism as you are at dishing it out, and if you upset the wrong person it could be you who suffers.
taurus,You may be tempted to force through changes you know others don’t want but think of the resentment that could create. Mars in your fellow Earth sign of Virgo endows you with a remarkable will to win, but you don’t have to win every time.
taurus,You don’t have to justify your opinions to anyone, not now, not ever. You are entitled to your beliefs and are under no obligation to submit to cross-examination from those whose perspective on life is highly unlikely to be the same as your own. ,taurus,There will be a number of obstacles placed in your path today but although they may be annoying they won’t be too serious, so don’t overreact. With the Sun moving into your opposite sign tomorrow the less hassle you experience the better. ,taurus,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Scorpio means if you try to deceive partners and colleagues they will see through your tactics. The only way you will get ahead is by being open and honest with everyone. Look for ways you can work together. ,taurus,You will be tempted to throw caution to the wind and do something outrageous. With Venus, your ruler, linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, you are sure to shock and amaze, but you will do so with a great deal of style and good humor. ,taurus,The harder you try to satisfy your own desires the more others insist that you take care of their needs first. The full moon warns that, just this once, it might be wise to give in to their demands and do what makes them happy.
taurus,You may find it hard to treat others as your intellectual equals but you would be wise to pretend that you take what they say seriously. And check your facts too. The approaching full moon in your sign warns you could easily make a fool of yourself. ,taurus,You need to work more closely with others and you need to understand that their opinions and your opinions might differ in legitimate ways. You don’t have to agree with everything they think or say or do to be able to get along with them. ,taurus,Why do you care so much what other people say about you? It’s not like you to seek approval but for some strange reason you crave the support of partners and colleagues at the moment. Just be careful you don’t pay too much for it. ,taurus,Any worries you have about an affair of the heart will be laid to rest over the next few days. The simple fact is you have never been more loved and admired and the sooner you recognize that fact the happier you will be.
taurus,Partners and colleagues may have the upper hand at the moment but that does not mean you are powerless. On the contrary, the planets suggest that if you believe in yourself you can make things happen the way you want them to happen.
taurus,You will be rather critical of other people this weekend. Do others deserve what you say about them or are you just covering up your own faults and failings? If it’s the latter it might prompt others to start asking questions you cannot answer. ,taurus,It may be the case that someone has been using you to get ahead in their career but don’t make an issue of it. You should feel flattered they chose you to help them climb the ladder of success. Also, of course, they now owe you a favor. ,taurus,You may get upset and emotional about something today but later in the week it will baffle you as to why you lost control. In partnership situations try to give others the benefit of the doubt. They are not deliberately trying to annoy you.
taurus,You think you can take on the world and win and no doubt you can. Confidence is a wonderful thing because it makes so much more possible, and with your ruler Venus on good terms with dynamic Mars today nothing is beyond you. Go for it!,taurus,Something you have been trying to keep a secret will be revealed for the whole world to see. There is no point trying to deny what you have done, so you might as well go to the opposite extreme and make the most of it. Enjoy your notoriety!,taurus,You may have to pay over the odds for something today but don’t make a big deal of it. It’s only money and is of no great importance. Don’t ruin what promises to be an otherwise enjoyable day for the sake of a few dollars.
taurus,Others can wallow in self-pity if they want but you have a more positive attitude. If bad news arrives from out of the blue today you won’t let negative thoughts take hold. Instead you will focus on what needs to be done – and do it.
taurus,You will find yourself on the defensive this weekend and it is unlikely to be a pleasant experience. Having said which, you have almost certainly brought the situation on yourself by making claims that cannot be backed up by facts. Time to backtrack, a little. ,taurus,Anyone who thinks you are too laidback will think again when they see how passionately you follow your dreams. Deep down you know if you don’t make your move now you will have to wait a long time for the next opportunity. Go for it.
taurus,If someone offers to help you out over the next 24 hours you would be wise to think carefully before taking them up on the offer. The planets warn there will be strings attached and you could end up paying more than you expected.
taurus,It would be easy to point out the flaws in another person’s belief system but would it make any difference? Probably not. Some people can be incredibly stubborn (look in the mirror occasionally!) so don’t waste your time or energy on them.
taurus,Partners and loved ones have been hugely demanding of late but you have gone out of your way to meet their needs. Today’s new moon will in some way or other reward you for your efforts. Don’t let anyone tell you that you don’t deserve it. ,taurus,You must slow down a bit – in fact you must slow down a lot. You have been pushing yourself extremely hard of late and, yes, you have accomplished a lot. But after every period of exertion must come a period of rest, so take a break!,taurus,No matter how many times you have failed in the past you will make up for them all over the next few weeks, simply because you believe in yourself and refuse to give up. Your staying power is legendary and guarantees success. ,taurus,You probably won’t be thinking straight over the next 48 hours, so try to avoid making plans and certainly don’t take any serious decisions concerning finances or family. Weekends are there to be enjoyed, so focus only on what makes you happy. ,taurus,Your tendency to fear the worst will be intensified by what happens early in the new week. The good news is that even if something bad does happen it will in some way work in your favor, so don’t worry and don’t lose your nerve. ,taurus,There may seem to be no obvious reason for what happens over the next 24 hours but in the greater scheme of things it has a purpose. Your task is to discover what that purpose is and find ways to make the changes that occur work for you.
taurus,Something will happen today that catches you by surprise. It may not be the kind of surprise you enjoy very much but if you are honest you will admit, if only to yourself, that you needed a bit of a kick to get you moving again.
taurus,You seem to be plagued by self-doubt at the moment. Why? Whatever the reason you must snap out of it because there is serious work to be done. Current aspects make you a bit more sensitive than usual but don’t let that paralyze you completely.
taurus,It would be nice if you were the kind of person who likes everyone and never gets angry but the simple fact is you are not, so if someone has begun to get under your skin make a point of avoiding them today, and every day if necessary. ,taurus,It will be easy to get impatient with people today but, seriously, why bother? Mercury’s entry into the area of your chart that governs joint financial matters means you will need all your energy – mental, physical and emotional – for more important issues.
taurus,Strike a blow for freedom. Let those who have been holding you back know that as from today you and you alone will decide what to do with your life. You have been too eager to let others guide you in recent weeks. Now you’re the boss.
taurus,If someone avoids giving you a straight answer to a perfectly straightforward question, then be on your guard, You don’t have to be paranoid but you do have to take whatever moves you feel are necessary to protect your personal and professional interests.
taurus,You must be very careful who you rely on today and throughout the coming week because there is a great deal at stake. If a partner or co-worker makes a mistake don’t let employers or other important people put the blame on you.
taurus,What happens today will convince you that what you have been working on in recent weeks was not what you should have been doing. But that’s okay. Now you are free to pursue something that is much more in keeping with who you really are. ,taurus,The full moon makes this an important time for money issues, so weigh your options carefully and don’t make a choice until you are 100 per cent sure you are doing the right thing. If you act on impulse today you could regret it tomorrow. ,taurus,The pressure you are under may be intense but it’s nothing you have not experienced before and nothing you cannot handle. In fact, you will make such a success of what you are doing that even your rivals will shower you with praise.
taurus,If you let your suspicions get the better of you today it is more than possible that you will miss out on something that would have been a lot of fun. Not everyone is out to get you or grow rich at your expense, so don’t be so defensive. ,taurus,Over the next few days you will feel a lot more confident about your abilities than you have been of late. Don’t be afraid to express your opinions, however out of the ordinary they may seem, because you are now in a position to change things. ,taurus,You can’t put a foot wrong at the moment, but if you are smart you will continue to look ahead. Lady Luck is on your side and there is little doubt that you will make the most of it. Just be careful you don’t exhaust yourself.
taurus,If you have fallen out with someone close now is the time to kiss and make up. You will find just the right words to convey how much you regret any misunderstandings and they, in turn, will go out of their way to say sorry too. ,taurus,You will come to the aid of someone who is in need of defending today, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you have to be there for them each and every time. Sooner or later they must learn to stand on their own two feet. ,taurus,You will be overly sensitive to criticism today but now that you know that you can stop yourself from getting emotional. It may appear as if partners and colleagues have got it in for you but more likely it is just you overreacting. ,taurus,Try not to take what others say too seriously because among all the good advice there is sure to be something designed to trip you up. It would be nice to believe that everyone you work with is on your side but you know it isn’t true. ,taurus,Be careful with cash today because you could easily make a costly mistake. What seems like a good idea now may turn out to be anything but later on, so err on the side of caution and don’t let greed be your guide.
taurus,Forget about your worries, forget about your woes (real or imagined), forget about anything but having a good time with the person who means most to you in this world. No matter how far apart you may have drifted you are on the same wavelength now.
taurus,According to the planets you are taking certain things and certain people far too seriously. Remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things nothing is worth getting worked up about and nothing is ever as bad as it seems. Find reasons to smile. ,taurus,You seem to be immensely popular at the moment, most likely due to the influence of Venus, your ruler and planet of affection, moving through the relationship area of your chart. So long as you don’t take liberties others will do almost anything for you.
taurus,Your daily routine will be interrupted today and you won’t be too happy about it. Having said which, does your life really need to be so regimented, so organized? Probably not. Maybe you should try to relax a bit. Workaholics definitely do not have more fun. ,taurus,Try not to act for selfish reasons because you will gain more in the long-term if you help others as well as yourself. A good deed done now will pay off later, so think before you act and act only in ways that bring smiles to other people’s faces. ,taurus,Speak up immediately if you need help. As communications planet Mercury moves in your favor today you won’t be in the least bit shy or tongue-tied. Let others know what it is you need and they will give it with no questions asked. ,taurus,Today’s new moon puts the emphasis on your money situation, especially investments and property issues and anything of a financial nature that involves other people. Lady Luck will be smiling on you over the next 24 hours, so make some profitable moves.
taurus,You need to patch things up with someone you have fallen out with. What caused you to drift apart is of no importance – the one and only things that matters is that you want to be friends again. Put your differences behind you once and for all.
taurus,A great deal has happened in recent weeks and not all of it has been to your liking. But the good news is you have learned a lot, both about yourself and about other people. Now put that knowledge to good use – be amazing!,taurus,You may not want to give up on a goal but that, it seems, is your only viable option, if only because to carry on with it will require the kind of cash you no longer have. Let it go and next time aim for something cheaper.
taurus,Partnership matters will go a lot more smoothly over the next few days and after the upsets and upheavals of recent weeks that’s welcome news. It’s mainly because you are a lot less competitive, and a lot more relaxed, in one-to-one situations. ,taurus,Someone you live, work or do business with will find fault with some of the things that you choose to do today. Whether or not their comments are fair is beside the point: what matters is that you ignore what they say and carry on regardless. ,taurus,If you poke your nose into a situation that does not concern you today you may end up regretting it. Think how you would feel if others were to involve themselves in your private affairs without being invited. Be smart – keep your distance. ,taurus,You can sense that there are changes coming, changes that will enable you to move in a new and exciting direction when the Sun moves in your favor early next week. Between now and then do only what your heart tells you to do.
taurus,The most important thing this weekend is that you focus on the big picture and let other people take care of the details. Your priority is to keep whatever task you are currently involved with on the right course. Don’t lose your vision and commitment.
taurus,The adventurous side of your nature will come to the fore over the next few days. The most important thing is that you allow yourself to experience new situations, because that is how you will learn more about the world and your special place in it.
taurus,What happens during the early part of the week will force you to accept that there may be other explanations for what has been going on in your life. There is no point trying to kid yourself: you’ve got to make changes – and soon. ,taurus,This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you as the Sun’s change of signs endows you with almost limitless confidence. But try not to take life too seriously. Make a point of seeing the funny side of everything that happens. ,taurus,Your instincts will guide you and protect you, so there is no need to be fearful. Anyone who doubts that you can be original will have those doubts silenced over the next few days. Creatively and artistically now is the time to take chances.
taurus,This is not a good time for taking risks, so don’t be tempted to gamble, even if the odds are in your favor. Travel plans, too, are likely to be disrupted, so unless you must be on the move it might be wise to stay at home.
taurus,You may be tempted to dabble in something today that promises big rewards for what seems to be a very small risk. Before you proceed, ask yourself if you can afford to lose what you are planning to wager. If not, give it a miss.
taurus,Whatever else happens this weekend you must not allow your emotions to take control. Keep your personal feelings under wraps and focus only on facts and figures. What happens today will require a resolute response but don’t go over the top.
taurus,It is possible that you will come into money over the next few days. However, it is also possible that you will waste money on things you don’t really need. Maybe you will do both and you will end up with the same as when you started!,taurus,You must have the courage to follow your dreams. If you reach for the sky between now and the early days of the new year you will achieve something truly amazing. It’s time to get over your self-doubt and shine like a star again.
taurus,There is a danger today that you will be too assertive and say something that annoys people in positions of power. Try to engage your brain before you open your mouth. Better still, don’t open your mouth at all for a while. ,taurus,You need to forgive yourself for the mistakes you have made. There is no point wishing you could go back and change what you did, so you might as well move on. What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so get over it. ,taurus,You may seem a touch less energetic than you usually are but in one area at least – money matters and business issues – you must find a way to overcome your lethargy. If you want your share of the good things in life you will have to earn them. ,taurus,It may seem at times as if the world is in turmoil but things are not as bad as they might appear and what happens in the opening days of the new year will help you to see that. Be of good cheer, it’s not all doom and gloom.
taurus,Keep your money in your pocket this weekend. If you don’t you will be amazed how easy it is to waste your resources on things you don’t really need – and which no one will want to buy back from you later when you run short of cash. ,taurus,Your aim over the next few days must be to forgive those who have injured you in some way. The planets indicate that if you can do this you will gain something that makes up for what you have lost many times over. ,taurus,You will be a bit emotional today but, just this once, that may be no bad thing. Some people seem to believe they can let you down at the last possible moment and get away with it. You need to remind them that actions always have consequences. ,taurus,Your confidence will soar over the next few days. You will believe in yourself with every fiber of your being and that belief will make the impossible possible, for you at least. Don’t expect loved ones and colleagues to always be on the same level though.
taurus,Everyone seems to agree with what you are saying but there is a danger that with so many people singing your praises you will lose sight of the fact that you make mistakes just like everyone else. Don’t let the hero worship go to your head. ,taurus,You have taken on a lot of new responsibilities of late and now you are beginning to wonder if you are doing too much. At some stage today things will get on top of you to such an extent that you are forced to cut back on commitments. ,taurus,All of a sudden one or two things seem to be going wrong – thanks to retrograde Mercury – but there is no need for alarm. All you really need to watch out for is that, where joint money matters are concerned, you don’t trust others more than you have to.
taurus,The intensity of your emotions will surprise you over the next 48 hours, most likely because you have kept your feelings under such strict control of late. The good news is that now you have a constructive outlet for your desires. A new relationship maybe? ,taurus,This is one of the best times of the year for you but to make the most of it you need to overcome your tendency to fear the worst. Your mind is a powerful tool, so think positive thoughts and positive things will happen more often than not.
taurus,If you have been thinking about changing direction in your career now is the time to start making some serious moves. All options are open to you, it’s just a question of choosing the right one. Make it the one that brings the most success and satisfaction.
taurus,You seem reluctant to put your point of view across at the moment, even though you clearly have something of value to say. Overcome your doubts and express yourself in the kind of plain and simple language that everyone can understand. Get your message across. ,taurus,Throw caution to the wind over the next 24 hours and do whatever it takes to make your mark. Aim to be first in everything you do and before the day is over your name will be up in lights. Don’t pretend you don’t want that – because you do! ,taurus,The planets warn that no matter how much you may desire something once you have got it you will realize it was not what you wanted after all. The fact is you are searching for something deeper, so look inside your head and your heart. ,taurus,You will get through chores, at home and at work, in record quick time today – and will make an excellent job of them too. You will also reach a decision about an offer you have been in two minds about taking. The decision is . . . wait a while.
taurus,Don’t jump to conclusions over the next 48 hours because the planets warn they could be way off target. That could be rather embarrassing if you are the type of Taurus who hates it when other people prove you wrong. Yes, it happens sometimes.
taurus,You won’t be short of things to say over the coming week but some of the things you come out with could be a bit controversial, so don’t be surprised if there is a backlash. Be that as it may you have a duty to call it as you see it.
taurus,You may not have a choice as to what you have to do today but you do have the choice about how you do it. The planets indicate that if you make a good job of your current task you will be rewarded with more enjoyable tasks in the future.
taurus,The Sun’s imminent change of signs makes this a good time to make plans – and promise yourself that this time you will succeed. If you know what you want and if you believe in yourself there is precious little you cannot accomplish.
taurus,The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart today will boost your ambitions no end but you must be realistic about what you can hope to achieve. Also, the fewer goals you allow yourself to have the more energy you can put into them.
taurus,It is important that you approach the day in a light-hearted manner because that will make it easier to deal with the huge responsibilities now coming your way. Don’t take what you have to do too seriously – just get on with it and keep smiling. ,taurus,You must be true to your beliefs, even if it brings you into conflict with people you would prefer not to antagonise. You are entitled to your opinions and others are not entitled to suggest that you do not have the right to think for yourself.
taurus,You have been rather daring in recent weeks and you must keep it going. The more changes you make, both in your personal life and at work, the more you will achieve, the more you will earn and the more options you will have in the future.
taurus,If someone lets you down this week try not to get angry about it. Also, try to understand that the full moon means that partners and loved will take what you say seriously and criticism, even if warranted, may hurt them in ways you don’t understand. ,taurus,Everyone needs powerful friends. There is only so far even a Taurus can go on their own and once you recognize that fact you won’t be quite so eager to keep a barrier between yourself and other people. Reach out and make contact.
taurus,Your task today, and for the remainder of the month, is to put a name to your desires. What is it that drives you? What is it that you want most out of life. Once you have decided that the next step is easy: go out and get it.
taurus,You have worked long and hard to get where you are now – don’t throw it all away by being impulsive. The planets warn if you let your emotions get the better of you it could damage your credibility with people in positions of power. ,taurus,Your social life will get a boost today and there is also a possibility that love will come into your life – you will certainly meet someone who gets your pulse racing. Is it the love of your life? Maybe, maybe not, but either way it will be fun. ,taurus,Try not to make a big deal out of a trivial issue today. Remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things it’s not really important. Life is a game and not to be taken too seriously. Say that often enough and you will start to believe it. ,taurus,Today’s Mercury-Pluto link encourages you to be bold in your thinking – and to act on what your thoughts tell you. Some people say you are too rigid mentally, that your mind is inflexible. Now is your chance to prove them wrong.
taurus,Attitude is everything and if you can convince yourself that you are exactly where you need to be and that life is wonderful then you will be exceedingly happy this week. Don’t let those who always seem to focus on doom and gloom bring you down.
taurus,You must move fast to get ahead of your rivals. Certain people seem determined to prove to the powers that be that they are the ones most deserving of promotion but they will only succeed if you let them. Strike first and strike hard. ,taurus,If you are unhappy about something you must speak up but you must also emphasize the positive rather than the negative. Also, don’t get into the mindset of believing that the world is a bad place – it isn’t, it’s a good place. Adjust your attitude.
taurus,You have this vague feeling that something is not quite right but you can’t work out what it might be. Usually your instincts are spot on but this time, it seems, they have got it wrong. Something will change soon but it will change for the better. ,taurus,Stick to tried and trusted methods today, even though some may complain that you are too old-fashioned. Maybe you are but not everything that is old is wrong and at least you get things done, which is more than can be said for some people you know! ,taurus,The sooner you stop blaming other people for your current predicament the sooner you will be able to take control of your fate. Whatever your problems may be you still have room to maneuver. Your main task now is to take responsibility for who you are.
taurus,With Venus, your ruler, linked to passion planet Pluto this weekend your head and your heart will, for once, be saying the same thing. What is it they tell you? That nothing more is expected of you than to love, laugh and have fun! ,taurus,Monday’s new moon means it is only a matter of time before your talents are recognized. It might happen sooner, however, if you let employers and other important people know that you are ready to be entrusted with new responsibilities.
taurus,Important people will do things for you today and if you want to move up in the world you will soon get your chance. A new moon in the career area of your chart will make it easy for you to make a good impression on authority figures.
taurus,You may get twice as much done in half the time it takes most other people but that does not mean you have to do it. If anything you should be cutting back a bit now. If you keep doing it all others will come to expect it of you. ,taurus,Today’s Venus-Jupiter link will in some way remind you that there is more to life than money and power. Whatever it is that inspires you go after it with purpose and passion. Follow your star wherever it leads – it is sure to be some place good.
taurus,Don’t let your personal life get in the way of your career. You must not, of course, neglect family and friends but on this occasion it is right that they should take a back seat while business comes first. You can make it up to them later.
taurus,There may be nothing you cannot handle but why burden yourself with so many commitments? Just because you can do most tasks better than other people you know does not mean you have to do them. Learn how to delegate.
taurus,You will be put to the test this weekend and it will be the kind of test you come through with flying colors. There may be a few bruises and scratches to show for your struggles but you will wear your wounds with pride.
taurus,Your imagination will be working overtime this week. In one way that’s good as you will be more creative than usual, but in another way it’s bad as your ideas are at odds with what everyone else wants to do. So they will have to change, won’t they?,taurus,This is a great day for social activities and maybe affairs of the heart as well. Even if you are the kind of Taurus who isn’t much good with words you will be chatty and charming and make a good impression on someone you have fancied from afar. ,taurus,As Venus changes signs today you should be looking for compromise solutions, not making more enemies. The planets warn if you insist on getting your own way it will cause unnecessary ill feeling and more problems than it manages to solve. ,taurus,You have important things to do and only a limited amount of time in which to do them. You can make life easier for yourself by sharing the load with friends and work colleagues but it will mean sharing the rewards as well. Can you do that? ,taurus,The Sun in Pisces as from today will boost your self-esteem and bring you into contact with people whose ideals mirror your own. Sometimes it may seem as if the powers that be are against you but that will inspire you to fight all the harder. ,taurus,You are in one of your assertive moods at the moment and won’t stand for anyone telling you what to do. Which is fine as far as it goes but don’t close your ears to advice just for the sake of it – some of it may be good advice. ,taurus,You will look for a compromise solution to a problem this week and, of course, that is the right thing to do. But the planets suggest if you give ground others will see it as a sign of weakness and expect you to do so again. Don’t give an inch.
taurus,You need to decide where your affections belong. According to the planets it must be one way or the other – there is no middle ground. If you cannot make a reasoned decision for yourself the full moon will make it for you. ,taurus,The more you try to tell others what they should be doing today the more they will do the opposite just to spite you. You have to accept that some people do not like to be directed – and this is certainly not the time to come on strong.
taurus,This is a good time for romance and the planets suggest you will make friends with someone today who could become a lover. But if you think they might be the one for you then act quickly. You’re not the only one who has designs on their affections. ,taurus,Usually you are happy to let others argue about what is going on in the world but today you will demand to have your say too. Others will be so shocked they might actually listen for a change. If not, don’t be afraid to shout! ,taurus,Do something special, something that gets you noticed and marks you out both as a free thinker and a person of action. Don’t wait for opportunities to come to you, get out into the world and grab them for yourself. Soon your name will be up in lights.
taurus,If you want to get things done over the next two or three days you must bring other people into your plans. The simple fact is you won’t get far on your own, so open up and let family and friends know what it is you need.
taurus,Think the best of the people you meet along the way, because if you look for the best in others you will also find it in yourself. Live by your highest ideals over the next seven days. Do your bit to make the world a better place.
taurus,There are times in life when it is better to give up than to struggle on with a thankless task and this may well be one of them. If what you are working on refuses to bend to your will, take the hint and move on to something else.
taurus,The more you try to tell others what they should be doing today the more they will do the opposite just to spite you. You have to accept that some people do not like to be directed – and this is certainly not the time to come on strong.
taurus,Don’t get too caught up in the idea of winning and losing or you might take it too far and expect too much of yourself. Remind yourself what it means to enjoy the simple things in life, none of which require you to win a gold medal.
taurus,You may look calm on the outside but on the inside your emotions are bubbling and what happens today and over the weekend will bring them to the boil. That’s good. It isn’t healthy to keep all that passion and aggression bottled up inside.
taurus,You need to be on your guard when dealing with people on a one-to-one level, both in your private affairs and in your career. You may not be the sort who gives your trust too easily but some people can be very persuasive. Don’t let them sway you.
taurus,You must base any and all decisions you make on logic rather than emotion. Being such a practical person that would not usually be a problem but you may be tempted to act irrationally over the next 48 hours. Give the feeling time to pass.
taurus,It may seem as if the odds are stacked against you but you have what it takes to break through any and all obstacles placed in your path. You must let everyone know you mean business over the next few days. Who would dare take you on? ,taurus,Make sure you are precise in what you are trying to say. If you leave your words vague no one will know what it is you are trying to communicate and nothing much will get done. Don’t worry that you might hurt others’ feelings – be blunt.
taurus,You may not agree with what a loved one is planning to do but don’t be critical. If you say something negative that will encourage them to do what they were going to do all the more, so you might as well stand back and let it happen.
taurus,You need to be with people who share your outlook on life, especially if it seems that other groups of people are plotting and fighting against you. Ally yourself with those whose principles are in line with your own. There is safety in numbers.
taurus,The Sun in the friendship area of your chart urges you to get together with people who share your passions and your outlook on life. Not only will you have a lot of fun, you will find ways to make the world a better, and happier, place. ,taurus,Are you dissatisfied with your lot? Do you think that your talents are being wasted? If so, you need to do something about it. That means something now, not tomorrow or the day after. And it means something real, not just another daydream.
taurus,You will be much in demand socially over the next 48 hours and could meet someone who becomes more than a friend. Also, however, you could be too forgiving and let people take advantage of you. Don’t be too nice for your own good.
taurus,Try not to do anything that might put your reputation at risk. The most important thing today and over the coming week is that you always tell the truth, even in situations where it might be easier to lie. Honesty is always the best policy.
taurus,No one expects you to be perfect, so don’t expect it of yourself. Like everyone else you have limits and if you are smart you will identify what they are and make sure you stay within them. You can still do amazing things.
taurus,You will do whatever it takes to reach your goal. No sacrifice is too great for you. No effort is beyond you. But while you may have the power to transform yourself don’t fall into the trap of thinking you can transform other people – you can’t. ,taurus,If you doubt someone’s honesty you must err on the side of caution – certainly don’t let them take financial decisions for you. The planets warn that what others say and what others mean are likely to be two entirely different things today. ,taurus,If you have to disappoint a friend then so be it – there is no point tying yourself in knots because you don’t want to hurt their feelings. Sometimes you have to speak the truth no matter what the consequences might be. ,taurus,If you feel the need to cut yourself off from those around you over the next two or three days then do so. It may seem rude to family and friends but good manners are less important now than getting your head in the right place. ,taurus,Make sure you are in control of your thoughts this weekend because if you let your thoughts control you they will lead you all over the place. Plan ahead in both your personal life and your work, but always stay in touch with reality.
taurus,No matter how bad something may look right now it will look a lot better later in the week, so don’t despair. You need to make a conscious effort to recognize the bright side of life. It’s there – all you have to do is open your eyes. ,taurus,The more you do for friends, family and even strangers over the coming week the more they will do for you later on. Don’t try too hard though. You don’t have to be a saint, just be yourself and do the best that you can.
taurus,Cosmic activity in the most vulnerable area of your chart means you will be looking over your shoulder more than usual over the next few days. It’s good that you are being careful but don’t start believing there is some sort of conspiracy against you. ,taurus,What others say may sound positive but can you believe it? According to the planets they are saying what they think you want to hear rather than what they know to be true and that could be dangerous. Demand to know what is really going on. ,taurus,There are a lot of chancers and tricksters out there and the planets warn you will come into contact with at least one of them today. Take what they tell you with a large pinch of salt. And if they try to sell you something – run a mile. ,taurus,You are not the sort to let minor irritations get you down and that’s good because there will be plenty of them today. Certain people will provoke you with their petty ways but you must not respond in kind. Smile and rise above it all. ,taurus,Be wary of people who promise you a huge payday for a small investment. Common sense should tell you just how unlikely it is that their get-rich-quick schemes will succeed. Hard work is the key to success – always was and always will be.
taurus,You must let others know what you are thinking over the next few days. In most areas, and especially where your home life and relationships are concerned, a fair and frank exchange of views is essential if you are to overcome difficulties.
taurus,Whatever it is you fear the most, that is what you should actively seek out today. The way to overcome your anxieties is to look them squarely in the face. Your fears don’t have a life of their own, only the life you choose to give them. ,taurus,The more cautious you are by nature the more likely it is you will take risks over the next two or three days. Ultimately, only you can decide how far to push your luck but your decision must be based on common sense, not wishful thinking.
taurus,A habit or method that served you well in the past no longer seems to be working. So get rid of it. Sometimes you have to be ruthless with yourself and this is one of those occasions. Life never stands still for long, and nor should you. ,taurus,One small act of kindness from you could be all it takes to start a chain reaction of some kind that makes the world a better place. Never doubt that what you do makes a difference. What kind of difference will you make this weekend?,taurus,You may not be very happy about what takes place this week but deep down you know it is the start of a healing process. This is the perfect time to confront your thoughts and your feelings. You can’t hide them from others, so why hide them from yourself?,taurus,Try not to overreact if a friend tells you something you don’t want to hear. You may rather have been kept in the dark but later on you will be thankful they brought it to your attention. You’re a Taurus and mentally tough enough to take it.
taurus,You may want to help someone in need today but how much can you really do for them? If, as seems likely, their problems are largely of their own making, all you can do is point them in the right direction and hope they take the hint.
taurus,If you accuse someone of something they did not do the repercussions could be major. It won’t be one of those situations you can laugh off – it could damage your relationship beyond repair. Don’t open your mouth and put both feet in it.
taurus,You don’t have to do as other people say or live the way they want you to live. Today’s new moon will help you break free of the bonds that others impose on you, as well as the bonds you impose on yourself. ,taurus,You may be tempted to rush through what you are doing but it is a temptation that must be overcome. If you give less than 100 per cent today you will have to give much more later in the month – so get it right now. ,taurus,There is a danger now that you will get carried away and start thinking that you just cannot lose. To an extent that may be true but the planets warn you are asking for trouble if you take your good luck for granted. ,taurus,It’s not often you want to retreat from the world but the current cosmic picture means you will be more inward-looking than usual. That may be no bad thing. Even a Taurus needs to meditate on the meaning of life once in a while.
taurus,You need to have a heart-to-heart talk with someone who seems to be drifting away from you. Most likely there is nothing much wrong with your relationship but it could be they feel you are not paying them the attention they deserve.
taurus,You will have to use all your powers of persuasion to convince someone that they should follow your advice, but with Venus, your ruler, energized by Mars today that won’t be to difficult. Flirt and flatter if you think it will help.
taurus,Something will happen today that takes you by surprise, but there is no need to worry about it because it will be something you enjoy. It’s time for you to step into the spotlight again and let people know you exist. Some may have forgotten! ,taurus,There is a huge luck factor working in your favor at the moment and you must make the most of it. Jupiter’s influence means that both in your private life and in your work you cannot put a foot wrong, so do something amazing. ,taurus,Look back over the past few months and learn what you can from both your successes and your failures. The Sun’s entry into your sign in a few days time marks the start of a brand new cosmic cycle. Make sure you’re ready for it.
taurus,According to the planets you are trying too hard and making life difficult for yourself when it does not have to be. Cut yourself some slack and don’t worry about whether or not you are on top of your work – it’s not as important as you think. ,taurus,You won’t lack for courage or confidence over the next few days – in fact you will be full of yourself. You know the good times won’t last forever so you are determined to get the most out of what life has to offer right now.
taurus,The more you have been held back from following your dream the more determined you will be to move forward over the next few weeks. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you will at last be in a position to make things happen.
taurus,You may not have been in an adventurous mood of late but you will make up for it over the next few weeks while the Sun travels through your sign. You will suddenly be enthusiastic about the kind of ideas that previously you rejected as impractical.
taurus,The Sun in your sign will help overcome your natural caution – you certainly won’t spend the second half the day worrying about what you did during the first half! Even your wrong moves will work out for the best over the next 24 hours.
taurus,The Sun in your sign will endow you with so much surplus energy over the next few weeks that you may at times wonder what you are going to do with it all. For best results balance creative activities with plenty of physical exercise. ,taurus,It may seem as if the world is against you but most likely you are overreacting to what, in the greater scheme of things, is of only minor importance. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and do something dynamic. The cure for self-pity is action.
taurus,Your value system will be challenged over the next 48 hours, and something that was precious to you in the past won’t be so precious to you in the future. Loved ones may find it hard to accept your new outlook. Find a way to convince them. ,taurus,The Sun in your sign gives you plenty of time to make plans and put them into effect. But don’t wait too long. Certain issues will force their way to the fore and if you don’t deal with them quickly wasted days could become wasted weeks.
taurus,The more you try to disguise your true thoughts and feelings the more likely it is others will misinterpret your actions and conclude you have something to hide. Maybe you do, but so what? Everyone has secrets and yours are actually quite tame. ,taurus,The only way you are going to resolve a personal issue of some sort is to confront it head-on. The more you try to pretend that it does not exist the deeper it will bury itself in your subconscious, so be brave and face up to your demons. ,taurus,The Sun in your sign urges you get your act together and get started on a project you know has the potential to bring you fame and fortune. Focus on your number one ambition and don’t stop until you have accomplished all you desire.
taurus,Everything in your world is so positive at the moment that you can easily turn dreams into realities. However, because Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases today you must accept that even a Taurus can’t do it all. Think quality, not quantity.
taurus,Sometimes you can be too much of a perfectionist and for some strange reason you seem to believe that you have to demonstrate higher standards than anyone else. That is sure to cause a lot of unnecessary strain. Strive to be human, not superhuman.
taurus,Venus moves into your sign today, which suggests either that an existing relationship will hit new heights of passion or a new relationship will begin in a flurry of kisses. Yes, this is going to be a weekend to remember for a very long time! ,taurus,You will find it easy enough to get your way now but you will find it easier still if you tell others what they want to hear. A few well chosen words could be all it takes to turn aside anger and turn a rival into a friend.
taurus,To say this is good time of year for you is a massive understatement – it’s one of the best. Give yourself permission to dream and before you know it your dreams will start to come true – that’s a promise from the stars!,taurus,The Sun in your sign makes a superb link to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, today, so get your act together and do something special. Even if you are the shy and retiring sort you must put on a show – and make it big! ,taurus,What you need to remember now is that persuasion always works better than coercion. If you try to force others to do things against their will it is you who could lose out in the long-term. Compromise is a must – always. brompt,taurus,What happens today will remind you how important it is to look out for your own interests. You may be shocked by how quickly a so-called friend turns on you but you should have seen it coming. Never take anything for granted. ,taurus,Solving other people’s problems has taken up a great deal of your time of late but now you must do something for yourself. A new moon in your sign holds out the chance of a new beginning. Personally and professionally all things are possible.
taurus,Yes, you should have made more of an opportunity of some kind but there is no need to feel bad about it because there will be plenty more chances to shine. The Sun in your sign makes all things possible, so don’t stop dreaming.
taurus,It may be annoying that certain people always seem to get the wrong end of the stick but don’t hold it against them. Chances are they just don’t possess your ability to cut through all the trivia and get to the root of a problem. ,taurus,The universe is very much on your side at the moment and with Jupiter, planet of good fortune, moving in your favor as from today you can’t put a foot wrong. Will your optimistic bubble burst? Maybe it will eventually, but not yet.
taurus,You will have to deal with a challenging situation today but with Venus, your ruler, and Jupiter, planet of good fortune, on ideal terms at the moment it won’t cause you a moment’s bother. Others will marvel at how well you handle yourself. ,taurus,Lady Luck will smile on you today, most likely from an unexpected direction. You may be suspicious as to why you are being singled out for so much good fortune but hopefully you won’t let that stop you taking advantage of it. ,taurus,The Sun in your sign makes you feel as if anything is possible – and maybe it is. However, you would do well to remember that even a Taurus has limits – also, that the higher you fly the further there is to fall if things go wrong. ,taurus,It may be worrying when someone who is usually so in control of themselves gets emotional but the planets indicate it’s no big deal. You cannot legislate for the way they react, so take it in your stride. Normal service will eventually be resumed. ,taurus,With love planet Venus in your sign on the best possible terms with passion planet Pluto you will go out of your way to ensure that the object of your affection knows how much you care for them. A romantic weekend is guaranteed.
taurus,It might be wise to wait until later in the week before deciding what needs to be done about a business matter that is causing a few problems. The bigger your personal stake in the issue the more cautious you will need to be. ,taurus,You have accomplished a lot of late, thanks to the Sun in your sign, but you still need to rely on the goodwill of people whose power and influence can open doors for you. With that thought in mind, watch what you say this week. ,taurus,It will be hard to know who genuinely needs your help and who is just too lazy to make an effort to help themselves. Follow your instincts and don’t be afraid to say “no” to people you do not trust. Your judgment will be sound. ,taurus,You will exude an air of utter confidence today, and the people you deal with, both in your personal life and at work, will be hugely impressed by your positive attitude. Most of them will do whatever you ask of them – so ask away!,taurus,The Sun leaves your sign tomorrow and that means you will need to get serious about your cashflow situation. Hopefully come the start of next week you will have paid off what you owe – and maybe found a new source of income too.
taurus,It is time to get serious about your plans. Take a look at what you have started in recent weeks and ask yourself how many of those things are truly worth pursuing. It may be you can cut your workload by half, or more.
taurus,Don’t be surprised if someone tries to distract you or stop you from making a success of whatever it is you are doing. And don’t let it put you off. They are, of course, afraid that you will do something remarkable and show them up. And you will.
taurus,If you rush an important task you may make a bad job of it and then have to go back later on and do it all over again. The urge to get things done quickly is not always the best motivation, so plan carefully and move slowly.
taurus,Life should be a lot less stressful over the next few days. It would help, of course, if you did not try so hard to get your message across to colleagues and loved ones. You will find your voice soon enough – and have plenty to say!,taurus,Someone is in a generous mood at the moment and if you are wise you will take advantage of it. If you need to ask a favor of them, now is the time to make your approach. You may be surprised how easily they agree to your request.
taurus,You are worrying too much about what other people might think of you and it is holding you back from doing things you would enjoy. You and you alone have the right to decide what is right and what is wrong – for yourself at least. ,taurus,If you lose your temper for no apparent reason try not to blame yourself – it’s just one of those things. If there are any deep-seated resentments in your life then a powerful Jupiter-Saturn link will bring them to the surface over the next 24 hours. ,taurus,It will be more difficult than usual to get your point of view across today – in fact certain people will simply refuse to listen to what you have to say. Whatever the reason for it there is no point pushing too hard. Let the situation work itself out. ,taurus,Something will happen over the next few days that affects your cashflow situation. It may, to begin with, mean you have less to spend but by the middle part of next week your financial position will be on much firmer ground. ,taurus,Your money situation is looking a lot better now and what happens over the next few days should finally enable you to balance the books. Remember though that you don’t have to be wealthy to be happy – it’s more a state of mind. ,taurus,Because Taurus is a “fixed” sign you prefer things to stay as they are. That, however, is not going to happen, because the events of the next few days will take you by surprise and force you to be more flexible. Go on, you can do it! ,taurus,You have spent a lot of time and energy trying to understand why a loved one acts in certain ways but you are no nearer an answer. Maybe you should just give up and accept them for who and what they are – like they accept you. ,taurus,Today’s cosmic events will play havoc with your good sense where money is concerned. Yes, of course, it’s only bits of colored paper but it has value too. Come the weekend you may regret being so free and easy with your cash.
taurus,An offer that comes out of the blue will delight you at first but later you may wonder if it is the right thing for you. Also, how much do you know about the people you would be getting involved with? Dig a bit deeper before you accept.
taurus,You will get an opportunity to move up in the world over the next few days, but you don’t have to take what is being offered. If you are happy where you are then say so and stay there. There is no law that demands you have to be ambitious.
taurus,You will get an opportunity to move up in the world over the next few days, but you don’t have to take what is being offered. If you are happy where you are then say so and stay there. There is no law that demands you have to be ambitious.
taurus,You appear to have missed something important and must now go back and find out what it is. Don’t think you can just forget about it because it will only return to torment you twice as badly later on. Get on top of it right away.
taurus,You may be cautious by nature but the planets urge you to follow your instincts today, even if you don’t understand them. You have played safe too many times in the past – now you must even things up a bit. Throw caution to the wind.
taurus,Today’s powerful cosmic influences will help you to understand that most of the things you have been worrying about of late are simply not worth the time or the effort. Once you have freed yourself from fear life will be fun again.
taurus,You will go over the top in some way today, and spend a large part of tomorrow apologizing for your words and actions. But that’s okay – even a Taurus needs to let off steam once in a while. It won’t do any major damage to your reputation.
taurus,You have started a number of new things in recent weeks and all of them seem to be going well, but now you must be realistic and decide what is worth pursuing and what is just a waste of time. Be ruthless, especially with yourself. ,taurus,You will find it easy enough to exert yourself this weekend but if you go too far you could make yourself unpopular with certain individuals. That may not worry you now but it will do later on when you find out you need their assistance.
taurus,You are not the sort to take things on trust and that’s good because others will try to cheat you if they think they can get away with it. Where money matters are concerned you must get agreements in writing. You can’t be too careful. ,taurus,Something wonderful will happen over the next two or three days and you may well have to pinch yourself to make sure you are not dreaming. But don’t spend too much time admiring your good fortune – do something useful with it.
taurus,You will have to make some tough decisions over the next few days but that’s okay because no one is tougher than Taurus. But don’t get carried away and start laying down the law for everyone. Remember you’re supposed to be a nice guy too. ,taurus,Today’s cosmic alignment urges you to be more open with loved ones and relatives and work colleagues. You know that honesty is usually the best policy, and never more so than now, especially where money, possessions and status are at stake. ,taurus,No matter how well you think you are doing at the moment you should in fact be doing even better, so set your sights high and don’t rest until you have achieved something spectacular. This could be a time to remember, if you are brave. ,taurus,You need to be patient and you need to make allowances for those who don’t think or act as fast as you. Luckily, today’s cosmic influences will make it easy for you to stay calm and not let little things, and little people, annoy you.
taurus,You don’t know why you suspect that someone you should be able to trust is telling you lies but you do and you could be right. To be on the safe side don’t tell them anything that rivals and enemies might be able to use against you.
taurus,Hopefully you have by now got your financial house in order because the Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you want to enjoy yourself socially – and for that you need cash. Don’t waste your resources on things, and people, you no longer need.
taurus,You may be in a rush to get things done but unless you plan ahead a bit you may end the day further behind than when you started. What takes place later in the week will change your aims completely, so don’t waste too much time and energy.
taurus,Others will respond better to kindness than coercion today, so even if you have good reason to be annoyed make a conscious effort to stay calm. Besides, if you forgive someone’s minor sins now they are more likely to forgive your major sins later on! ,taurus,It might be best not to say too much today. Your ideas may be good ideas but the planets warn they could be rejected for no good reason. Watch out too they don’t get stolen by people who would happily get rich at your expense. ,taurus,Get your head out of the clouds and start thinking along more practical lines. Today’s cosmic influences will force you to recognize certain truths that have always been there but which up until now you have managed to ignore. It’s time to get real. ,taurus,You must not allow your heart to rule your head. Facts and figures must come first, both in your personal life and at work. Someone’s sob story may sound credible but the planets warn they are trying to trick you. You’re not that easily fooled.
taurus,With Jupiter and Pluto linked across the two most dynamic areas of your chart this is potentially one of the very best weekends of the year for you. Anything is possible if you want it enough, so put a name to your desire then go out and get it.
taurus,A friend in need may be the last thing you want at the moment but you are not about to turn your back on them. However, once you see them through their latest predicament make sure they know it’s the very last time.
taurus,There may be a lot of petty annoyances in your life at the moment but no matter how irritating certain people may be you must not let them get under your skin. Try to arrange your affairs so you are on the move as much as possible. ,taurus,It might be a good idea to keep your opinions to yourself today, especially if they are the sort of opinions that are likely to make you more friends than enemies. What you have to say may be perfectly true but not everyone wants to hear the truth.
taurus,You seem a lot more open and affectionate of late and that’s good. Any relationship problems you’ve had in recent weeks can easily be resolved over the next few days – all it takes is a bit of give and take (but don’t do all the giving). ,taurus,No matter how good a deal may sound it might be wise to turn it down. Nothing is what it seems at the moment and the more others say it is an opportunity that is too good to miss the more likely it is to be the opposite.
taurus,Whatever you lose today you will more than make up for early next week, so don’t try to hang on to possessions that are being taken away. Why are you being denied certain things? To remind you that quality is more important than quantity.
taurus,Try not to act on impulse over the next 48 hours. The planets warn if you act without thinking events will spiral out of control and the consequences could be traumatic, not only for other people but for you as well. Keep your head down. ,taurus,You will do something this week that shows what a sensitive and loving human being you are. No, really. The approaching new moon will do wonders for your ability to tune in to other people’s needs, and your practical mind will come up with answers that work.
taurus,Why are you spending so much time arguing with people whose views and opinions you do not respect? Could it be that you are not so sure of your own position as you like to make out? Doubts are natural – don’t deny them.
taurus,There are times when it is obviously better to give up on something than to carry on with it and this is one of them. If what you are working on refuses to take shape it means you need to draw a line under it and start over. ,taurus,With Venus, your ruler, on good terms with energy planet Mars today you will find it easy to reach goals that in the past were beyond you. This is also a good time plan a vacation. Where in the world would you most like to go?,taurus,You don’t have time for gossip, so by all means ignore those who talk endlessly without actually saying anything worthwhile. Don’t worry that you might hurt their feelings. You have important things to do and you cannot think with all that noise! ,taurus,You will get more out of being sociable than sitting at home watching the TV today. Someone you meet on your travels will open your mind to such an extent that you realize just how much you have been missing. Life should always be an adventure.
taurus,Something you see or hear will get you thinking along new lines today and there is no telling what conclusions you will reach. One thing is sure though: you will never look at the world in quite the same way again – and that’s good. ,taurus,It may feel as if something important is going out of your life but don’t worry because something better will come in to replace it very soon. Remember though that you tend to attract to you what you think you deserve. Imagine you deserve it all.
taurus,You have a lot of things to do and only a limited amount of time in which to do them. You can and you should make life easier for yourself by sharing the load with friends, but that means you will have to share the rewards as well!,taurus,Make the people you love feel special today. Reach out and remind them how much you value what they have done for you. Petty disputes are just that – petty – and must be forgotten. This is the perfect time to kiss and make up.
taurus,You don’t have to be what other people want you to be. You are and always have been the only one who controls your destiny. Others people’s expectations must play no part in what you choose to do next. You alone are master of your fate. ,taurus,It may seem as if the world is against you but nothing could be further from the truth. All that is happening is that cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart is making you a bit touchy. Stay calm, it’s life.
taurus,Push personal worries to the back of your mind and resolve to have fun. The Sun in Cancer at this time of year brings all sorts of social and travel opportunities, so why dwell on negative thoughts and feelings when you could be having a good time?,taurus,This is a great weekend for social activities and affairs of the heart. You could fall head over heels for someone you meet on your travels but if you do you must be dynamic and make your move quickly. Others will be after them too. ,taurus,Cosmic activity in the social and travel area of your chart makes it easy to find new friends and influence important people. Don’t be afraid to interact with those you see as being above you on the social scale. They won’t be above you for long.
taurus,You have this vague notion that something is not right with your life but you cannot figure out on what it might be. Tomorrow’s full moon will resolve the situation once and for all and most likely there will be little to worry about.
taurus,Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good but today you will go right the other way and make sure that anyone who gives you a hard time regrets it. You are under no obligation to be nice to people who are not nice to you.
taurus,According to the planets there is a danger that you will take on too much and harm yourself physically or emotionally. Why do you think you have something to prove? You are who you are and that’s enough – in fact it’s plenty. ,taurus,No matter what happens today, and no matter how worrying it may look on the surface, believe that everything will work out for the best in the end. Nothing in life is ever so bad that it can’t be improved by how you choose to deal with it. ,taurus,The planets warn this is probably not the best time to point out other people’s flaws and failings. What partners and loved ones and relatives need more than anything now is a confidence boost. What can you do to help them feel good about themselves? ,taurus,You are usually careful about what you say and do but today you will go to the other extreme and act in ways that are deliberately outrageous. You feel compelled to give someone a shock. Just watch out it doesn’t lose you a friend.
taurus,Fate will point you in a new direction over the next few days and you must not fight against it. There may be times when you are swept along at dangerous speeds but there is no need to worry because the planets are looking after you.
taurus,You seem to be in one of your perverse moods at the moment. The more others agree on what needs to be done the more determined you will be to disagree. Most likely it’s because your inner voice tells you it doesn’t pay to follow the herd.
taurus,Don’t take what others tell you too seriously today. It could be their kind words are genuine but it is just as likely they are saying what they think you would like to hear so as to catch you off your guard. You don’t need flattery.
taurus,You’ve got this worrying feeling that you should be doing more, that you are not reaching your full potential. Yes, maybe you have been a little bit lazy of late but you don’t now have to go to the other extreme. Find a workable middle way. ,taurus,As a rule you don’t much like surprises but what happens today will not only surprise you but please you too. If you are invited to a social event don’t turn it down just because you’ve got work to do. Spend quality time with your friends. ,taurus,The fact that you are looking back and thinking about what might have been suggests you are unhappy with your lot and need to make changes. So go ahead and make them. The only thing that is stopping you is your own indecision. ,taurus,Put your family first this week. No matter how busy you may be on other fronts you must make time for your nearest and dearest. Tuesday’s new moon will bring domestic issues that have been swept under the carpet into the open again.
taurus,Put your family first this week. No matter how busy you may be on other fronts you must make time for your nearest and dearest. Tuesday’s new moon will bring domestic issues that have been swept under the carpet into the open again.
taurus,Just because you think you know what is good for other people does not give you the right to force them to change. Others must be free to make their own mistakes if they choose to, no matter how ridiculous their actions may seem to you.
taurus,Today’s new moon threatens to bring half-hidden grievances to the surface and it’s likely that things will get a bit emotional. But that’s no bad thing. You desperately need to face up to and confront your inner demons, as well as your enemies.
taurus,Let those who have been holding you back know that from here on in you alone will decide what is best for you. That applies to all areas of your life, including your finances, where you have been a little too eager to let “experts” guide you. ,taurus,There will be a lot of distractions in your life over the next few days and if you allow yourself to get caught up in them it may be a long time before you find yourself heading in the right direction again. Fun and games can wait. ,taurus,Anything done as part of a team will go exceptionally well over the next few days but anything you do on your own will be more of an effort and may not yield the results you expected. Much as you treasure your autonomy, being a team player can be equally rewarding.
taurus,The next 48 hours should be hugely productive but for best results you must do something different, something you have not attempted before. If you go over the same old ground in the same old way you will just get the same old results.
taurus,You need to be more selective about your aims and ambitions. If you scatter your energy in several directions you are unlikely to get far in any of them. Decide what it is that means the most to you and focus on that exclusively.
taurus,Why are you worrying yourself sick about the state of your finances? What you seem to have forgotten Taurus is that in the greater scheme of things material wealth means nothing at all. Stop worrying and start living your life free from fear.
taurus,If you want to move up in the world, if you want to make a name for yourself, now is the time to do something about it. Don’t be afraid to show employers and other important people what you can do. They will like what they see.
taurus,You seem to believe, on no real evidence at all, that something bad is going to happen. Most likely you have been reading too many headlines and the constant negativity has rubbed off on you. It is still a pretty good world.
taurus,Short journeys will be hugely enjoyable today and you may even meet someone who gets your heart racing. But don’t go over the top and declare your undying passion for someone you will probably have forgotten about by this time next week!,taurus,You may think you would do better in a brand new environment but most likely that is an illusion brought on by dissatisfaction with where you are now. If you are unhappy you should look inside yourself for the cause before making any kind of move. ,taurus,Certain people are avoiding giving straight answers to your perfectly simple questions. Why is that do you think? It could mean they are plotting something you won’t much enjoy – but more likely they are lining up a delightful surprise for you.
taurus,Like it or not you will not be able to control what happens over the coming week – but you can choose how you react to it. No matter what happens you must strive to stay serene. Even your rivals will respect your self-control. ,taurus,The worst possible thing you could do over the next few days is to make claims you know are not true. You don’t have to big yourself up. Just be yourself and have faith that those in authority will like what they see. They will.
taurus,Under no circumstances let your emotions get the better of you today, because once you start down the slippery slope of anger you won’t be able to stop. It does not matter what or who is annoying you – you must stay calm.
taurus,You may find it hard to be nice to someone you have clashed with several times in the past but don’t go too far and refuse to have anything to do with them. Personal feelings must not be allowed to affect your working relationships. ,taurus,If someone is rude for no good reason today then by all means be rude in return. However, the full moon warns the situation could easily escalate and get out of control, so only answer like with like if you really think it is necessary.
taurus,Be very careful who you rely on today and over the weekend because there is a great deal at stake. Help partners and co-workers make the right choices – if they don’t, employers and other important people may put the blame on you.
taurus,A friend will hand you some shocking news this weekend but you really should have seen it coming. No matter how upset you might be with the situation do not get personally involved. You have no dog in this fight, so stay clear.
taurus,The world will be a happier place over the coming week – well, your world will be anyway. No matter where you might be or what you might be doing you will find ways to have fun. Friends and colleagues will be inspired by your example.
taurus,Start something new this week, something of a creative nature. The planets indicate that if you try your hand at something different you will discover a talent that has lain dormant for many years. Use it well and it could make you rich.
taurus,As the Sun is now moving through the most dynamic area of your chart your confidence will rise and you will start to believe in yourself again. Creatively and emotionally this is your best time of year, so be bold – and be romantic too.
taurus,You like to help people when you can but sometimes it’s better to keep your distance and let others work things out for themselves, and such a time is now. Don’t let friends and colleagues get into the habit of assuming you will do it all for them.
taurus,Don’t sit around worrying that life is passing you by – get out there and make an impression. The Sun in Virgo at this time of year means your potential is unlimited, so take a few risks and show the doubters you are a force to be reckoned with. ,taurus,Be truthful today, even if it means upsetting people you love. The planets warn that if you try to keep unpleasant news from partners and relatives they will find out about it anyway, and blame you the most for not being honest about it.
taurus,You will feel good about yourself over the next 48 hours. No matter how many bad things may have happened in recent times only good things will happen now, so put your fears behind you and go out and have fun with people you love.
taurus,Mercury, planet of communication, turns retrograde on the 30th, so you would be wise to avoid making too many plans. This is not a time to take silly chances, especially with your reputation, this is a time to watch and wait.
taurus,You will be on the move a lot over the coming week – you can’t seem to stay in one place for any length of time. Someone you meet on your travels will open your mind to new possibilities, and in doing so transform your existence.
taurus,You need to lighten up a bit and stop worrying about things that most likely will never happen. Remember too that it is not only your physical health that is important but your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing too. Be kind to yourself.
taurus,At some point today you will see a pattern that you have somehow missed these past few weeks. After you have finished kicking yourself for being so dumb you might like to enlighten your colleagues as well. Many of them are still lost.
taurus,There is no point feeling hard done by if things don’t work out the way you expect this weekend, because overall you are still moving in the right direction. The Sun in Virgo guarantees you will enjoy many more successes than failures.
taurus,You will start to feel stronger, both physically and mentally, over the next few days. If nothing else you will realize that certain things are not worth worrying about, that what will be will be. If your outlook is positive your life will be positive too. ,taurus,The line between fact and fiction may be a bit blurred today, so make sure you know what you are doing and don’t get carried away with outrageous ideas. That applies especially to creative endeavors – know your limits and stay within them.
taurus,You should be looking forward, not back. The Sun in Virgo at this time of year makes so many things possible but for some reason you want to go back and change what has already happened. You can’t, so forget about it and look to the future. ,taurus,What happens out of the blue today will both surprise and delight you. Others may be less than pleased with events over which they have no control but you have been waiting for something like this to happen and intend to take full advantage. ,taurus,You are going through a fortunate phase at the moment but you must not let others tell you that you have been lucky or that you are unworthy of success. In the greater scheme of things there is no such thing as chance. We get what we deserve. ,taurus,The Sun in Virgo does wonders for your confidence but with Jupiter, planet of good fortune, changing signs today there will be times over the coming weeks when doubts begin to creep in. Ignore them – Lady Luck is still smiling on you. ,taurus,With Saturn and Neptune making such a tense link this weekend it is more than likely that accidents will happen. The trick, of course, is to make sure they don’t happen to you. Make every effort to keep out of harm’s way.
taurus,You need to be more aggressive in pursuit of your interests. Both professionally and financially you have been giving more than you have been getting in recent weeks, so now you must turn things round and make sure you get your fair share.
taurus,This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done but there is also a tendency to take on too much or deal with too many people. Be selective about your aims this week, and ruthless with those who waste your time.
taurus,This is a great time for getting things done and getting important people on your side, but don’t take on too much or make promises you may not be able to keep. Just do what comes naturally and others are sure to be impressed.
taurus,You have the power to make things happen but that does not mean you must make them happen. Sometimes you can be a bit too pushy for some people’s tastes, and that could be a problem today and tomorrow. Try to be a bit less intense.
taurus,Forget about pleasing other people and do only what pleases you. Today’s lunar eclipse will bring with it opposition of some kind but the momentum is all on your side at the moment, so don’t even think about changing course. ,taurus,Keep important information to yourself over the next 48 hours because the more you reveal what you know the less valuable it will be. You don’t have to be secretive but you do have to recognize that knowledge is a precious commodity.
taurus,At some stage over the next few days you will reach a decision about a partnership matter that has been causing you sleepless nights. It has taken you a long time to make up your mind but now that you have you must act swiftly. ,taurus,Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Virgo makes it easy for you to get things done, which in turn makes it easy to forgive others when they make mistakes. You like the world to know you are more capable than those you work with.
taurus,A friend or family member will tempt you to take the kind of risks you usually prefer to avoid. You have nothing to prove to anyone, least of all yourself, so stick with what you know and trust. Yes Taurus, it’s okay to be boring. ,taurus,The time has come to change your everyday methods and routines. You may be a creature of habit but even you can recognize that certain ways of doing things are not working as well as they should, so admit that changes are needed – then make them. ,taurus,Everyone is singing your praises at the moment, which is nice, but your main aim today must be to sing someone else’s praises and help them feel more confident about themselves. Assure them that you will support them whatever it is they choose to do.
taurus,What occurs this weekend may seem random but in fact there is no such thing as coincidence. Never doubt there is a purpose and a meaning to your existence and to every single thing that happens in your life. Think about that over the next 48 hours. ,taurus,If others complain that you are making life difficult for them that is a sure sign you are doing it right. The kind of people you are now dealing with are the kind of people who would not hesitate to cheat you, so you owe them no favors.
taurus,Your feelings for someone are deeper than other people realize and what happens over the next 24 hours will in some way or other bring them to the surface. Don’t put them on too high a pedestal though. They’re still human like you.
taurus,Over the next few weeks your energy levels will soar and you will get through twice as much work as you usually manage. But don’t spend all your time working because this is a time for fun as well. Have you thought about taking a vacation?,taurus,There is no point trying to change things today. All you can do is go with the flow and trust that in time you will regain the advantage you now seem to have lost. Everything moves in cycles and your turn will come round again. Be patient.
taurus,Most likely you will go over the top in some way today but that’s okay because the planets will protect you. Let others know what it is you desire, and let them know you expect to get it soon – they won’t dare deny you!,taurus,Can you depend on what other people tell you? Chances are not even partners and loved ones can be trusted to give you correct information at the moment, so err on the side of caution and, if you really do need guidance, listen to your inner voice.
taurus,Those who have been giving you a hard time must be left in no doubt that you will no longer put up with their negative behavior. You have serious things to do in your life and have no intention of wasting your time on critics and cynics.
taurus,Cosmic activity in the work area of your chart means you must deliver what you have promised – if not there will be trouble. In future you might like to think twice before agreeing to take on so many new tasks. You can’t do it all.
taurus,Someone in a position of authority will look kindly on you today and if you are smart you will use their friendship to help you reach your goals. You don’t have to agree with them on everything but let them know you respect their opinions. ,taurus,There is a simple solution to your number one problem and it won’t be long before you realize what it is. According to the planets you may have to make do with less for a while but you will make up for it later in the year.
taurus,Someone you meet on your travels will become very important to you between now and the end of the year. It seems you are on the same wavelength mentally and emotionally and have a lot to teach each other. Together you can go places. ,taurus,You may choose to go it alone today, tomorrow and over the weekend but the planets warn you won’t get far. However, if you join forces with people who share your aims and ambitions there will be enough success to keep everyone happy. ,taurus,Someone will give you a hard time today in the hope that you will overreact and do something silly. But now that you know that you won’t fall into their trap, will you? No matter what happens, you must keep your temper under control. ,taurus,A little voice in your head is telling you that someone you have business dealings with is not to be trusted. You would be wise to pay attention. If there is money at stake over the next 48 hours don’t let others make decisions for you.
taurus,If you make an effort to be tactful this week you will win over to your side people who are not your natural allies. You also need to accept that some people will never want to do the kind of things that you want to do. It’s no big deal. ,taurus,Don’t blame fate if what happens today is not to your liking. The message of the planets for the coming week is that you must be strong and accept what occurs, be it good or be it bad. Your shoulders are broad enough to carry the load.
taurus,You will be tempted to push yourself harder than ever today but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. You are moving at high speed already and if anything should be thinking about slowing down a bit. Or do you want to crash? ,taurus,If you are eager to boost your earnings then what you hear over the next 24 hours will give you some ideas as to how you can make it happen. First though, ask yourself: is your cashflow situation really so bad? Maybe you should just spend less. ,taurus,With Mars and Pluto well placed in your chart you can, if you so choose, blast your way through your opponents’ defences. But why use up all that precious energy when you could, with a little bit of thought, charm them just as effectively? ,taurus,You may have to accept a supporting role of some kind but that’s okay. If nothing else it means you won’t be held responsible if things start to go wrong. Teamwork is always good, especially when it allows you to share the blame. ,taurus,Don’t gamble with your health this weekend because a Sun-Jupiter link could tempt you to take the kind of risks that lead to injury. You may be tough but you are not indestructible. Have fun but make sure you know what your limits are.
taurus,A lot of things are happening at the moment that you cannot make head nor tail of. Don’t worry, you are not the only one who is utterly confused. So much is changing, and so fast, that no one is entirely sure what is going on.
taurus,If you feel that a certain course of action is right for you then go for it. Ignore those who say it cannot or should not be done – chances are they are jealous that they do not possess your level of self-belief. Shame them with your success.
taurus,You can be amazingly assertive at times but the planets warn you would be wise not to force other people to do things against their will today. If you do, someone more powerful than you may decide to do the same thing to you.
taurus,If you are in any way ambitious then you would no doubt be the first to admit that your achievements in recent months have failed to live up to your dreams. Get out there and show what you can do. Make a name for yourself.
taurus,The more certain people say that they are acting in your best interests the more likely it is they are acting in their own interests. Only you know what it is you desire, so don’t give anyone the authority to make decisions on your behalf.
taurus,With the Sun now moving into your opposite sign you will have no alternative but to find ways to get along with people who annoy you. Forget about your differences, at least for a while, and focus on areas where you have something in common. ,taurus,It seems that friends and loved ones will do almost anything for you now, all you have to do is ask. Is there a catch? Well, maybe later on they will want a little something in return but it won’t be anything you don’t want to give.
taurus,As Mercury moves into your opposite sign today you will find it easy to put your thoughts into words. Some of what you say may upset a few people but your task is to awaken those who are ready to hear a new message.
taurus,If you don’t like what a certain person has to say then make sure they know about it. Too often in life you avoid confrontation then sit there and fume in silence, and that’s not healthy. Make this the day you start biting back.
taurus,It may seem as if you don’t have a care in the world but you are in fact struggling with serious questions about your career. How closely do you identify with your work? Is it time for a change? These and other questions demand to be answered. ,taurus,If you are mindful of other people’s needs today you will accomplish a lot while working together. However, if you are insensitive and try to push them in directions they don’t want to go then tempers will flare and you will get nowhere. ,taurus,The time has come to put a long-running feud behind you. No matter what the initial cause of it may have been the fact is it is no longer worth the time or the aggravation, so hold out the hand of friendship and then move on. ,taurus,You will be on the receiving end of some serious criticism over the next 48 hours. Try not to overreact because there may be an element of truth in what is being said about you. Put your ego on hold and learn from what you hear.
taurus,You need to work alongside someone who shares your overall aims and ambitions, even though you may disagree with them on some of the details. Don’t waste time fighting each other when there is a common enemy you should both be challenging.
taurus,Make sure you know all the facts before making a big decision, because if you overlook information that could be important to your case you will spend the rest of the week trying to put things right again. Do your homework first.
taurus,Sometimes you can be too self-controlled for your own good and this is one of those occasions. Put duties and responsibilities out of your mind and spend the next 24 hours doing what makes you feel relaxed and at one with the world.
taurus,You are inclined to sweep away everything that has gone before and start again with a fresh slate. So what are you waiting for? It’s okay to respect the past but on this occasion the past is holding you back, so get over it and move on.
taurus,You are big enough and tough enough to blaze your own trail through life, so don’t worry that certain individuals are refusing to support you. What they say or do is of no relevance at all – you are the one who is in control.
taurus,There are times when you can no longer keep your feelings to yourself and this is one of them. With Uranus, planet of upheaval, dominating the most sensitive area of your chart the intensity of your emotions is likely to surprise you.
taurus,Mars, planet of action, moves into the career area of your chart on the 9th, which will endow you with a burning desire to succeed. Face up to whatever challenges come your way and show important people you are a force to be reckoned with.
taurus,The Sun in the partnership area of your chart means you will have to work hard to persuade those you live and work with to support your objectives. Flattery will work to a certain extent but you still have to show you know what you are doing.
taurus,The more someone tries to persuade you to back their latest big idea the more you should keep your distance. The current cosmic climate warns that while they may think they are on to a sure-fire winner most likely they are kidding themselves.
taurus,The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart this week makes this the ideal time to set yourself new goals and targets. Try aiming higher than you usually do because you are considerably more creative than you give yourself credit for. ,taurus,Mars, planet of ego, is now moving through the career area of your chart, so if you believe that you are worthy of bigger things you must let important people know what you can do. Believe in yourself and the world will believe in you too.
taurus,This is an important time for partnership matters and how well they go will depend at least in part on how big your heart is. Whatever others might have said and done in recent weeks you must strive to forgive and forget and move on.
taurus,Gentle persuasion is all you need to get your way, both at home and at work. It certainly won’t be necessary to force others to do your bidding – they will quite happily follow your lead if you spell out for them how they will benefit.
taurus,It’s not often that your emotions get the better of you but that could happen over the next few days as a full moon in your birth sign fuels your feelings in unexpected ways. Try not to hunger for things, and people, you can never possess. ,taurus,What you want to do and what other people expect you to do will be two very different things today and with a full moon in your sign the results could be explosive. Do what you can to find a compromise solution – yes, it is possible.
taurus,Don’t take on any new tasks or chores over the next 24 hours because you are doing more than enough already. Remember too that quality counts for more than quantity, so focus on the two or three things that mean something special to you.
taurus,The Sun in your opposite sign may make it seem as if everything is going against you but it isn’t remotely true. The most important thing by far is to maintain a positive attitude – then even bad things have a chance of working out right. ,taurus,Something you are told by a friend or work colleague will be at best misguided and at worst a blatant lie, so be on your guard. Others may say you are being too cautious but rather that than making a mistake which could ruin your reputation.
taurus,Whatever ideas you have today and over the weekend you can be sure that the cosmic powers-that-be are behind them 100 per cent. You may not get the opportunity to realize them just yet but it won’t be long before your chance to shine arrives.
taurus,No matter how hard you try to get along with someone they clearly don’t want to know, so stop trying to please them and please yourself for a change. Try acting as if you really don’t care. You may be surprised how quickly they change their tune. ,taurus,You are looking for answers and will soon realize that the best place to find them is inside yourself. Facts and figures may seem important but they mean less than your own feelings and intuition. Listen to your inner voice – it has lots to tell you.
taurus,Sometimes you wonder if certain people can really be trusted. Chances are that you are getting worked up for no good reason, but just in case your instincts are correct and you are being taken for an idiot make sure you have a Plan B.
taurus,You will accomplish a lot with a minimum of effort today. This is a good time for making deals because your powers of persuasion are so hard to resist. Hold out for what you want – you are sure to get it in the end.
taurus,Your money worries are nowhere near as bad as you think they are. In fact, what happens over the next few days will make you realize that compared to some people you are quite well off. Think positive and positive things are more likely to happen. ,taurus,There have been a lot of emotional ups and downs of late but in a way that’s good because if you can shake yourself free of negative feelings you can make the most of what happens next month when the omens are more in your favor.
taurus,It is of the utmost importance that you look out for your own interests, because no one else will. You should be promoting yourself for all you are worth now, especially on the work front where you deserve more recognition than you have been getting. ,taurus,You have been worrying about a money problem for no good reason. As from today though you will find it easy to stand back and see the situation for what it is, rather than what you fear it to be. You’re still a lot better off than most. ,taurus,You know that change is necessary but you are not yet sure how you should be going about it. What happens around the time of Tuesday’s new moon will help you to identify what direction you should be moving in. After that it’s up to you.
taurus,You have got to keep your mind on the job over the next few days. You have too many serious things to take care of to waste time on trivialities, so let others know that fun and games are out of the question, at least for now.
taurus,You have got to be tough, maybe even ruthless, but you have also got to be fair. You don’t need to stoop to underhand methods, you just need to play by the rules and put your heart and soul into what you are doing – then you will win. ,taurus,You look confident on the outside but on the inside your emotions are raging. It is of the utmost importance that you stay in control of your feelings, because if you lose your grip for even a moment you could do something you later regret. ,taurus,You are in danger of making a setback seem more drastic than it really is. Your mission today, should you choose to accept it, is to focus only on things that make you feel good. And remember: it’s often the little things that bring the most joy. ,taurus,You may be cautious by nature but you must still take the occasional risk. Today’s Mars-Jupiter link will make it easy for you to be more dynamic and important people will soon be singing your praises. Sell yourself for all you are worth – a lot! ,taurus,You will be in a serious frame of mind this weekend and that’s good because you are going to have some serious issues to deal with between now and the end of the year. Make sure your aims are realistic and, when you make a decision, stick with it. ,taurus,There is no need to be hostile in your dealings with other people. Even if they are the ones who are being needlessly aggressive it will pay you to smile sweetly, talk softly and make a point of being friendly. There is no percentage in confrontation. ,taurus,You will be rather self-indulgent today – and you have every reason to be. There have been numerous occasions of late when you should have treated yourself but for one reason or another did not, so all you are doing is balancing the cosmic books. Enjoy!,taurus,The truth is the truth even if it hurts, so if what you hear pains you today you must get past it quickly and decide what action needs to be taken. The truth might hurt less if you could accept that no one is perfect – not even you.
taurus,Mars, planet of ambition, is urging you to be forceful, but others aspects warn if you come on too strong you could scare off friends and colleagues whose help you are going to need. You must get the balance right: be dynamic without being destructive.
taurus,Focus on quality rather than quantity, both at home and at work. You may be tempted to take on more duties and responsibilities but that is a recipe for disaster. Do one thing really well rather than ten things poorly, or even moderately.
taurus,You are feeling good about yourself now and the personal troubles you’ve had in recent weeks don’t seem so much of a burden. Don’t overdo it with the celebrations though or you could create problems you did not have before. Moderation is a must.
taurus,Common sense is not so common that everyone possesses it – in fact very few do – and if you keep that thought in mind this weekend you won’t go far wrong. Do not, repeat not, allow others to handle your financial affairs over the next 48 hours.
taurus,You may not be a daydreamer by nature but you seem to be coming up with all sorts of weird and wonderful ideas. Do any of them stand much chance of actually happening? If not, don’t waste time on them. Get back in touch with reality.
taurus,You will get the chance to make money this week but you could also lose money if you start taking the kind of risks that are unlikely to pay off. The more straightforward a situation appears to be the more likely it is there is a hidden catch.
gemini,Loved ones will leave you in no doubt at all what they think and feel over the next two or three days. The good news is that what they desire is most likely what you desire too, so this could turn out to be a week to remember!,gemini,Honesty is the best policy today, especially if you have done something that makes you feel bad about yourself. Own up and have done with it – you will most likely be amazed how quickly partners and loved ones forgive you.
gemini,Optimism is generally a good thing but too much can be dangerous. The planets warn you must make an effort to see things as they are today, not as how you dream they might be. That applies especially to partnerships matters.
gemini,Someone in a position of power thinks you’re pretty special and if you are smart you will play up to it and make it pay. Use your way with words to get a promotion or a pay rise. If you’re really smart you might even get both.
gemini,Partners and loved ones will be full of themselves today and you may find it hard to get a word in edgeways. But that’s okay – let them chatter all they like. Give the impression you are listening, even if your mind is far away. ,gemini,You may be under pressure to apologize for something you said to a friend or colleague but is that wise? Not if you truly meant it. Besides, why give them the impression that you can be easily swayed? That’s asking for trouble.
gemini,Try not to be hurt or see it as a sign of rejection if a friend or work colleague tells you they want to go it alone. Not only will it be good for them but it will be good for you as well. And you won’t have to share the glory!,gemini,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Sagittarius may make it appear as if everyone but you is having fun but that is an illusion brought about by your negative attitude. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start making things happen. ,gemini,You may have to be cruel to be kind today. The planets indicate that someone you are close to emotionally needs to be reminded that they can’t always have things their own way. It’s in their interests that they get the message.
gemini,You seem to be getting through a lot of work of late, which is good, but you won’t be able to keep up this pace indefinitely, so start thinking of ways you can ease back a little. You need to stay sharp both mentally and physically.
gemini,If someone asks for your opinion on a personal matter you will be happy to give it. However, if your sixth sense tells you they won’t be happy hearing the truth maybe you should decline their request. Let them work it out for themselves.
gemini,Your thoughts seem to be a bit heavy at the moment and there are certainly one or two areas where you need to get serious. But don’t get so serious that all the fun goes out of your life. If it makes you smile it’s got to be right.
gemini,It may seem to others that you never lack confidence but that’s not always true and as the Sun moves through your opposite sign there will be times when self-doubt begins to bite. What do you do? You bite back – and hard!,gemini,The next few days should be productive but they will be more productive still if you take the time and make the effort to end one particular existing project that is holding you back. Some things are not destined to be completed.
gemini,Your emotions will be all over the place over the next two or three days and come Tuesday, when the moon is full in your sign, you could easily go over the top and say or do things that turn others against you. Self-control is a must.
gemini,You may have to bluff your way through the sort of situation you would usually cope with quite easily today. Fortunately others expect you to be confident and outspoken so you will carry it off and no one will be any the wiser.
gemini,The full moon in your sign suggests that at least one and maybe several challenges are heading your way and it is important that you face up to them. Don’t let anyone bully you, not even once, or they will never leave you alone.
gemini,Money matters may be causing you concern but other aspects indicate you can still have lots of fun. Besides, if you keep too tight a hold of the purse strings now you may have to spend more later in the month. Get the balance right.
gemini,Partnerships of all kinds have been under the spotlight of late and will remain so until the Sun moves out of your opposite sign this weekend. You can though still put your number one relationship on a firmer footing. Do it now. ,gemini,You don’t have to be nice to people just because you want to spare their feelings. If there is something that needs to be said, something that might give offence, then give it to them straight. A dose of reality will do them good.
gemini,The Sun now moves into the area of your chart that governs wealth and investments, so you need to think clearly and seriously about your long-term financial prospects. At the very least you should start saving for that proverbial rainy day.
gemini,You must do your own research when it comes to money matters and business deals. If you let others decide things for you almost certainly they will get it wrong, so make the effort and make sure you stay in control.
gemini,Don’t get uptight if someone you live or work with points out where you are going wrong. In fact you should thank them. Even a Gemini can make mistakes, so take it in your stride, learn from your error and do better next time.
gemini,You will have to take on new responsibilities over the next few days, including some of a financial nature. Make a serious effort. Show the world you have what it takes to handle difficult situations. And yes, you can still have fun.
gemini,It’s okay to be suspicious but the planets warn you could take it too far today. Just because someone changes their plans at the last moment does not mean they are trying to make life difficult for you, at least not on purpose.
gemini,You are who you are for a reason, so why wish you were someone else? If you stop wasting time fantasizing about who you would like to be and focus on making a better job of who you are you will soon be both successful and happy.
gemini,If you tend to worry a lot then what happens today and tomorrow will make you feel better about what has been going on in your life. Most importantly you will realize that maintaining a positive mental attitude is a must.
gemini,Times may be tough on the cash front but what happens this weekend will remind you how well off you really are. It’s not what you’ve got in terms of money and possessions that matters but how much love you give and receive.
gemini,Resist the urge to resort to underhand methods to get what you want this week. Even if your motives are pure it is your tactics you will be remembered by, so play by the rules and set an example. The ends do not justify the means.
gemini,The current cosmic set-up makes certain things look worse than they actually are, so don’t overreact if you don’t get what you want today. In the long-term, as always, you will get exactly what you need, so why worry?,gemini,No one expects you to be perfect, so don’t expect it of yourself. With Mercury, your ruler, linked to Pluto you may have to hold up your hand and admit that you made a mistake. In the greater scheme of things it’s of no importance. ,gemini,What happens today may take you by surprise but it will be in a nice way. Why have you been singled out for so much good fortune? Because at some point in the past you put yourself out for other people – now they are returning the favor.
gemini,Don’t let other people’s doubts stop you frompushing ahead with a plan you knowhas the potential to make you both happy and successful. Just because they don’t know how to dream does not mean you have to give up on your own.
gemini,It seems you have been talking at cross purposes with a loved one and that is why you have not been getting along. According to the planets it is time to sit down and be honest with one another. Yes, of course you can be friends again.
gemini,Things will seem a lot clearer once you’ve got this weekend out of the way, so bide your time and don’t be tempted to make any major decisions just yet. If you find it hard to work out who you can trust, then simply trust no one!,gemini,You will soon start feeling better about your long-term financial prospects, so don’t worry about the small stuff. But don’t take anything for granted either: if you splash out on unnecessary luxuries now you will most likely regret it later.
gemini,It will pay you to not be quite so open about what you are doing and why. You don’t have to be dishonest but you do have to keep information that could be useful to rivals and enemies to yourself. This is not a time for sharing.
gemini,The planets suggest that if you make an effort today it will pay off. The only problem is you are not in the mood to do anything too strenuous. That’s okay — you don’t have to exert yourself. But don’t blame others for your lack of progress. ,gemini,It may appear as if someone is being deliberately obstructive, and maybe they are, but you should also ask yourself if there was something you said or did that could have turned them against you. If so, it’s not too late to say sorry.
gemini,Few things in life are black or white but today you will know what is right and what is wrong and which course of action you should be taking. If you choose not to take it the consequences in the long-term may not be to your liking.
gemini,The first step toward resolving a problem is to recognize that there is a problem, and that is the step you must take today. For too long you have ignored the warning signs in the hope that they might be wrong, but they’re not.
gemini,The approaching full moon warns you must watch what you say and, if you do go over the top, apologize immediately. Do whatever it takes to stay on good terms with loved ones and relatives. Your security may depend on it.
gemini,Your values will change in important ways over the next few days, especially in how you look at money and possessions. What you need to learn is that it’s not what you own and earn that counts but what you do with what you’ve got.
gemini,You will be even more assertive than usual today, and that’s good, but don’t be so assertive that you scare people away. The way to win others round to your way of thinking is to persuade them with facts, not intimidate them with threats.
gemini,You may lose your temper with someone who lets you down or disrupts your plans. But don’t feel bad about it because you are not the only one whose emotions are up in the air at the moment. Even Geminis get annoyed once in a while.
gemini,Your ideas are as good as anyone else’s ideas but for some reason you seem to think you are not as smart as your rivals. It may be true they have fewer self-doubts but where intelligence is concerned you are way out in front.
gemini,Have faith in your dreams and don’t listen to those who say you are too far out with your ideas for your own good. They may think you are mad but it all makes perfect sense to you, and ultimately that’s the only thing that matters.
gemini,Two days from now the Sun moves into one of the most favorable areas of your chart, so there is every reason why you should feel happy about your prospects. Put worries and woes behind you and get ready to have some fun.
gemini,This could be and should be one of the best times of the year for you. Yes, okay, so the year has barely started but if you play your cards right you will look back on the next few days with fondness for many months to come.
gemini,You may be tempted to bend the rules but if you do you will regret it towards the end of the week when Mercury, your ruler, squares up to Saturn. One of the best times of the year is about to begin – you don’t need to cut corners.
gemini,Don’t waste time telling the world what you are going to do – just get on and do it. You should be aiming higher than ever before. Nothing is beyond you. Nothing is impossible. If you want something enough you can make it happen.
gemini,Certain people may be feeling down but they have no right to bring you down with them, so go somewhere there is music playing and people dancing and not a sad face to be seen. Do whatever it takes to keep your mood light.
gemini,The important thing now is that you keep your eyes fixed on the bigger picture and don’t allow yourself to be distracted by events that get in the way of your goals. You can still be sociable and have fun but you’ve got to be focused too.
gemini,You don’t have to be especially dynamic today. In fact, if you sit back and wait for good things to come your way they surely will. Also, your way with words will get what you desire in most situations. Who could even think of denying you!,gemini,Don’t be so eager to improve your money position that you start taking the kind of risks that are best avoided. Make a conscious effort not to panic, because if you panic you will do something silly and it may cost you a fortune.
gemini,You will be tempted to go to extremes this week and maybe, just maybe, it’s the right thing to do. The planets will protect you in most situations but even when you do get into trouble you will talk your way out of it with ease.
gemini,Listen to your instincts today because they are sharper than ever. If your inner voice tells you one thing while the so-called experts tell you another then you can bet your bottom dollar they have got it wrong. Trust yourself – always.
gemini,Make an effort to see things as they are, unclouded by wishful thinking or negative expectations. The planets indicate you can achieve more now than at just about any other time, so long as you keep your aims within reasonable bounds.
gemini,A friendship that has been on a downward spiral of late will pick up again. This time, make sure it stays up. You will have to accept that — in certain areas — you have and always will have different points of view.
gemini,If other people want to take control and decide what you are going to do together you should let them. Today’s new moon means you can afford to sit back and let partners make the difficult decisions. Whatever they decide, you will benefit.
gemini,Despite what some negative types might say most people in the world are just like you. Keep that fact in mind today when dealing with strangers. Get to know them better. You may be surprised how much you have in common.
gemini,Today’s Sun-Jupiter link could cause you to go to extremes in some way. Nothing much is likely to come of it but you may find yourself out of pocket if, on someone else’s advice, you take risks with your cash. So don’t.
gemini,You will have to deal with a challenge to your authority that could be quite serious. Don’t try to put it off, because the longer you leave it the more serious it will get. Make sure everyone knows who is the boss – and that’s you.
gemini,Information will come your way today that enables you to put one over on a rival. All is fair in love and war so don’t hesitate to use what you learn for your own benefit. They would do the same if the roles were reversed.
gemini,If you want to impress people in positions of authority, you had better be quick because as from tomorrow it won’t be so easy. Maybe you should give up trying so hard and just impress the one person who really counts — yourself. ,gemini,You have thought long and hard about what you are planning and all you need to do now is get on with it. Don’t worry that certain people may not approve – that is the least of your worries. Most likely they’re jealous of you.
gemini,Whatever you do for a living, the changes you make on the work front over the next few days will have huge effects over the coming months, so think carefully and, if there is any doubt, leave things as they are for the time being.
gemini,You have finally grown tired of an association that has had a lot more ups than downs, and now you are ready to call it a day. There may be a few regrets, but deep down you know this is one relationship you are better off without.
gemini,Mars in Libra endows you with amazing levels of energy and huge self-belief. However, no matter how confident you feel you would be wise not to take risks or take anything for granted. Know your limits and stay within them.
gemini,The answer to your money worries will appear soon, so stay calm and don’t do anything drastic. Sacrifices will have to be made but they won’t cause you too much pain, so long as you use your head — and the talents you were born with. ,gemini,It’s time to get serious about your ambitions. The winds of fate can blow you only so far – once you reach a certain point you have to get ahead on your own. What motivates you? What do you most wish to accomplish? Go for it!,gemini,As your ruler Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases today you need to be on your guard. It’s quite likely that someone will try to cheat you in some way – but now that you know that it won’t be so easy. Don’t be too trusting.
gemini,Today’s full moon makes minor disputes seem bigger and more important than they actually are, but now that you know that you can make a conscious effort not to take what you see and hear too seriously. If it’s not fun it’s not worth it.
gemini,You may be swamped with offers at the moment but you cannot possibly accept them all, so be smart and choose the two or three that are most likely to take you towards your goal in the quickest time. Assuming you have a goal, of course.
gemini,The Sun in Aquarius in recent weeks has done wonders for your confidence and that’s great but now you are about to be tested. Important people are watching you closely, so put on a show. You are destined for bigger and better things.
gemini,Carry a notepad with you at all times and be ready to write down any ideas that come into your mind. Your brain is always on the go but over the next few days you will be inspired, especially where career insights are concerned.
gemini,It will pay you to keep a low profile and wait for the effects of today’s Mercury-Saturn alignment to pass. That applies to all areas of your life, but especially to your work situation. Don’t be the tall poppy that gets noticed! ,gemini,You will come under pressure today, especially on the work front where someone in a position of authority will do their best to make life miserable for you. Stay cool and don’t let them provoke you. Deep down they are scared of you.
gemini,Disruptions are likely across the board today but chances are you won’t be as inconvenienced as some people. The good news is that upheavals tend to create new opportunities, so keep your eyes and ears open and be ready to act fast.
gemini,You like to speak your mind but try not to say anything that might be taken the wrong way by other people. You may not mean to be rude but you can sound rude sometimes when speaking your mind to more sensitive types.
gemini,How tough are you? Tough enough to rise to any challenge? Let’s hope so because the next few days will confront you with the kind of tests that bring out the best in some people and turn others into gibbering wrecks. Good luck!,gemini,If you want to get noticed and move up in the world it won’t be long before an opportunity to do just that comes along. While you’re waiting try getting your health and fitness routine in better shape. You’ll need to be strong.
gemini,You are going to have to make a difficult choice and what you decide will affect your life for months, maybe years, to come. Only you can make this choice but it’s got to be one thing or the other. The worst choice is no choice at all.
gemini,Everyone makes mistakes and everyone at some time or other wishes they could go back and undo what they have done. With that fact in mind don’t be too hard on yourself if you realize you could have done more or done better. You’re only human.
gemini,You will be challenged over the next few days, of that there is no doubt, but there also no doubt that you will rise to the challenge and come through unscathed. Remember: rivals and competitors are more scared of you then you need be of them.
gemini,If you have something to say, something you know isn’t going to please some people, then say it now. Don’t worry about or even think about the consequences – your job is to call it as you see it, and you see more clearly than most.
gemini,Be yourself and allow the creative side of your nature to shine through. Your rivals may try to upset your plans but they will only succeed if you allow them to annoy or distract you. Success is yours if you want it enough.
gemini,You may believe you are in tiptop shape but the planets warn this is not a good time to push yourself physically. If anything you should be focusing more on mental activities. Use your big brain to come up with money-making ideas.
gemini,No matter what you turn your hand to over the next few days it will work out better than you expected, and seeing as you expect nothing but the best of yourself that means you are going to accomplish something very special indeed.
gemini,The planets warn that if you come on too strong today someone you work or socialize with will be so intimidated that in future they will try to keep a distance between you, which is not what you want at all. Think before you speak.
gemini,Venus, planet of emotional and material values, moves in your favor today, making it necessary to think about who and what means the most to you. You know the answer already, of course, but it doesn’t hurt to remind yourself.
gemini,Good news about your finances is on its way and by the end of the week you will be wondering why and how you allowed yourself to get so worked up about a simple thing like money. Treat yourself – you deserve it and you CAN afford it.
gemini,You may be annoyed that a friend or family member failed to consult you before taking a course of action that affects you in some way, but don’t let it show. Frankly, there are more important things you should be focusing on right now.
gemini,If you hesitate you could miss out on something good this weekend. An opportunity to improve yourself will arrive in a moment and be gone in a moment too, so stay alert and make sure that you are the one who benefits.
gemini,This should be a relaxed and enjoyable week and it will be more enjoyable still if you share it with other people. Call on a friend or relative unexpectedly. Give them a surprise. Will it be a nice one? Of course – they always love seeing you!,gemini,The challenges keep on coming, and you keep on dealing with them in your own special way. There are few things that faze you and whatever life chooses to throw at you over the next seven days you will handle it all with ease.
gemini,This is a good time for creative activities, especially those where some sort of communication is concerned. Make sure you spell out what you are trying to say in words that are simple to understand. Not everyone possesses your brain power,gemini,Fight for your rights today, no matter how overwhelming the odds may be. Actually the odds are not nearly stacked against you to the extent you appear to believe. Remember, too, that your rivals are as scared of you as you are of them.
gemini,Relax and enjoy what the day brings your way. No matter how go-getting and ambitious a Gemini you may be there are times when even you must slow down and take time to smell the flowers along the way. Like right now.
gemini,Your mind may be full of ideas but for best results you need to focus on the two or three things that will be of most benefit to you. No matter how many ideas you have your energy is limited, so invest it where it does most good.
gemini,Push ahead with your plans this weekend and let employers and other important people know that you are serious about moving up in the world. A rival may try to persuade you that you are aiming too high but you must not believe them.
gemini,With a full moon cutting across one of the more active angles of your chart there could be power struggles, especially at work. Try to get rid of the idea that everyone has got it in for you. It’s not true – it’s just one or two people.
gemini,If you get the chance to move up on the work front you must take it. Don’t worry that you are not qualified for the job because energy and enthusiasm are more important than experience – and that’s something you’ll gain as you go along.
gemini,If you get the chance to travel today, even if it is just a few miles down the road, you must take it. Venus and Uranus combine in such a favourable way that the more you are on the move the more fun you will have.
gemini,No one dreams bigger than Gemini and if you play your cards right over the next few days there is every chance that some of those dreams will start to come true. The dividing line between fantasy and reality is quite narrow. Step over it.
gemini,There are so many positive influences for friendship at the moment that you would be a fool not to take advantage – and a fool you most certainly are not! If you need assistance in any way just open your mouth. Help is always available.
gemini,Try not to let your annoyance show if a friend gets something wrong today. Resist the urge to criticize and instead offer them words of advice in a warm and supportive way. Chances are they’ll get it right the next time.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, links with Neptune in the career area of your chart this weekend, which suggests you will be looking for a new start on the work front. Focus only on jobs you believe can really make a difference. Do something worthwhile.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, links with luck planet Jupiter this week, so it’s quite possible that you will come into money. But it’s equally possible that you will squander what you gain on impulse buys you don’t really need. Easy come, easy go.
gemini,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that influences friendships and group activities means you must not stay at home. Get out and meet people – real people, not just the ones you see on television. They certainly want to meet you.
gemini,Mars in Libra makes all things possible but for best results you must be selective. Don’t waste your time and energy on a dozen aims because that will dilute your chances of success. What is the one thing that motivates you most? Do only that.
gemini,You can sometimes be a bit too blunt for your own good and with Mercury, your ruler, linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, today you may very well say too much. But so what? At least, unlike some people, you have something worth saying.
gemini,If you can get someone else to do some of your chores for you today then go for it. You have more important matters to take care of and, having burned the candle at both ends of late, you may not have much energy to spare.
gemini,Money matters and career issues are under good influences today, so be brave and make the first move if you feel there is cash to be made or a promotion to be won. Success will be yours if you have the courage to reach out and take it.
gemini,A task may be a lot tougher than you expected but that is not a good enough excuse to give up on it. Everything that is meant to happen will happen when the time is right, so be patient. That breakthrough you need is not so far away. ,gemini,Think with your head, not with your heart. The most important thing as the new week begins is that you avoid making the kind of silly mistakes that so many other people make. Be rational and always put practical considerations first.
gemini,Something you have been worrying about for quite a while will fade in significance today and that’s good. But has the cause of the worry actually gone or has it merely faded into the background? You need to find out.
gemini,Just because you do not get along with someone on a personal level does not mean you cannot work with them. Put your feelings to one side and make an all-out effort to get a joint project finished. You may be surprised how smoothly it goes.
gemini,Call it as you see it today and don’t worry what the reaction might be. Not everyone will be pleased that you are so open about the issues and so free with your opinions but that’s their fault for backing ideas that are so easily disproved.
gemini,You have taken on a lot of new responsibilities of late but is that wise? You may think you can handle the extra work with ease but the planets warn it will sooner or later get too much for you. It should be about quality work, not quantity.
gemini,You must let certain people know that whatever bad blood there may have been between you in the past it is over and done with as far as you are concerned. Make the first move – on this occasion it will be well worth the effort.
gemini,Some of the people you will have to deal with this week are, to say the least, disconnected from reality. You may have to remind them all over again what is right and what is wrong and why certain things are just not done.
gemini,Don’t worry too much about your work and worry even less about your money situation – focus entirely on friendships and having fun. Mercury, your ruler, moves in your favor today and that means you should be on the move as well.
gemini,Don’t cling to ideas that are well past their sell-by date. They may seem comfortable to you now but later on they will hold you back from experiencing all the new things that life has to offer. Time never stands still, and nor should you.
gemini,Some people may be quite loud in their opposition to what you intend to do but don’t let it worry you and don’t let it stop you. They will come round when they see how well you are doing. They may even claim it was their idea.
gemini,It might be a good idea to tone down your comments a bit because the planets warn if you say something others consider to be over the top it will rebound on you in ways you had not expected. You can say too much you know.
gemini,Someone you have always thought of as a rival will surprise you today by being not just friendly but also open and honest on a personal level. Is it a trick? No it is not – they genuinely like you and want you to like them.
gemini,The planets warn there may be a tendency to see the negative side of events over the next 48 hours but now that you know that you can resolve to be happy no matter what happens. Attitude is everything. Always look on the bright side.
gemini,Have the confidence to try things you have no way of knowing will turn out for the best. This is one of those occasions when logic won’t help you much, so follow your instincts and trust they will lead you somewhere worth going.
gemini,Be careful with your cash because wealth planet Pluto begins one of its retrograde phases today. What does that mean in plain language? It means you could easily make a costly mistake. There’s no such thing as an easy dollar.
gemini,The planets warn you must not pretend that certain things are true when they clearly are not – it could be a costly mistake. If you must take a risk at least wait until the effects of the current eclipse wane towards the end of the week.
gemini,The only way you are going to move forward with a project is if you get the backing of people who can help you overcome the obstacles you are going to face. Give it another day or two before you approach them – then they’ll say “yes”.
gemini,You have no time for people who think and act slowly – which, compared to you, is just about everyone – but the planets warn you need to be a bit more lenient and forgiving today. Not everyone can operate at your superstar level.
gemini,You may be ambitious but ambition alone is not enough – you need to make sure that the career path you choose is worthy of your time and your energy. If you are not yet sure what it is you may get a few clues today.
gemini,Keep things in perspective over the next 48 hours and don’t let anything upset your equilibrium. The Sun’s entry into the most sensitive area of your chart tomorrow makes this a time for quiet reflection – but don’t get hung up on the past.
gemini,There is a danger that you will interpret information that comes your way in the worst possible light and believe that someone has got it in for you. Nothing could be further from the truth. Your only real enemy is your overactive imagination.
gemini,The way you treat other people now will determine how other people treat you later on, so resist the urge to say or do anything that might turn them against you. Do whatever it takes to stay calm and stay on good terms.
gemini,Misunderstandings are likely over the next 24 hours, so make sure you spell out what it is you are trying to accomplish and make sure everyone is on the same wavelength, because if they are not the results could be chaotic – and costly too.
gemini,Your feelings may be a bit fragile over the next 24hours, so steer clear of situations that are challenging and stay away from people who are rude and insensitive. Some days it is necessary to restrict yourself to your own company.
gemini,You don’t need anyone’s blessing or approval for what you are planning to do. All you need is the confidence to begin and the courage to follow through and finish the job. What are you waiting for? Now is always the best time to start.
gemini,You will find it easy to get your own way – others will take it for granted that you are the boss and do as you say. If you use charm rather than coercion you will find that almost everyone will do almost anything for you.
gemini,You know there is nothing to worry about but for some reason you still fear the worst. Don’t worry, the bottom is not about to fall out of your world. In fact, as from today your world will be a much happier place. Believe it – it’s true.
gemini,The more you do for other people this coming week the more you do for yourself. Don’t worry about whether they deserve to be helped – that is not your concern – just do what you can, where you can and be satisfied with that.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, may be moving through the most shy and retiring area of your chart but if past experience is anything to go by that will merely encourage you to redouble your efforts to put on a show. You like to be noticed.
gemini,You are paying far too much attention to what other people are saying and not enough to what your heart is telling you. You don’t need other people’s advice or assistance, you just need to turn your focus inward and follow your own inner voice.
gemini,You may have to get tough with someone who has let you down or failed to carry out the tasks that were expected of them. Don’t go over the top and create unnecessary resentment but do make sure they realize this is the last warning they’ll get.
gemini,If others want to make an issue of things that are of no significance to you then you have no choice but to turn your back and walk away. The last thing a big-brained thinker like you needs is small-minded people around you.
gemini,The planets indicate that what you do for other people now will come back to you many times over a few weeks hence when the Sun moves in your favor again. You don’t have to sacrifice much – just put others’ needs first occasionally.
gemini,You have a lot to do over the next 48 hours but you will find the energy from somewhere and impress just about everyone with your can-do attitude. You could be in the money too as past investments begin to pay off.
gemini,The message of the stars for the coming week is that you should be putting your many talents to better use. Don’t listen to those who say your aims are misguided because only you know, deep down, what it is you should be doing.
gemini,Creatively and romantically the next few days should be good for you, but for best results you need to be focused. Identify your number one priority and really go for it. Expect great things of yourself – you’ll achieve them with ease.
gemini,You will be in one of your more impulsive moods today. Try not to spend money on things you don’t need unless you know you can afford it – and unless you have recently won the lottery you know full well you cannot.
gemini,Start believing that you have what it takes to make a difference. Now that Mercury, your ruler, is moving into your sign the doubts of the past few weeks will be swept away. You will get your chance to shine, and in a good way.
gemini,If you don’t feel like socializing today then don’t force yourself. You are entitled to your own space and if others find that hard to understand then they are not very smart. Give yourself some time to meditate on and plan for the future.
gemini,You know there is a flaw in your plans but you are tempted to ignore it. Mistake. If you push ahead regardless you are sure to regret it. Work out where it is you have gone wrong, then make the necessary moves to put it right.
gemini,You will want to be on your own for a bit this weekend but anyone who thinks that means you are giving up on some sort of struggle obviously doesn’t know you too well. Use your time to plan and plot your next big adventure.
gemini,Set yourself easy goals this week, goals you can reach without too much of an effort. Better still, use your charm to get other people to do the hard stuff for you. On the work front especially you must not push yourself too hard.
gemini,With Mercury, your ruler, linked to ambitious Mars as the new week begins there is no reason why you should not reach the top of the tree in your chosen career. Yes, you do have what it takes – more so than your rivals. Go for it.
gemini,Everyone has fantasies and daydreams – you are nothing out of the ordinary in that sense – but the power of your imaginings could lead you in some unusual directions. Try to keep a grip on reality today, otherwise your mind could float away!,gemini,It might be wise to slow down a bit, especially if you have been pushing both your mind and your body to extremes. Cosmic activity in the well-being area of your chart warns if you push any harder you could face collapse.
gemini,You won’t be short of friends today, tomorrow and over the weekend as Mercury, your ruler, links with Venus, planet of harmony. What you do with others will be more enjoyable than what you do by yourself. The more the merrier!,gemini,Your confidence is high at the moment and it will get even higher when the Sun enters your sign on the 21st. Before then make sure you have tied up all loose ends and make sure your plans are solid. You can’t be too careful.
gemini,You need to decide, once and for all, what it is you want out of life – after that, of course, you need to work out how you are going to get it. Don’t let yesterday’s doubts and fears hold you back. Make each day a new beginning.
gemini,The Sun moves into your birth sign on Wednesday and a new solar year gets under way. The more you feel you have been held back the more you will accomplish over the next few weeks. It’s time to move up a gear.
gemini,The more others try to persuade you to get involved in a project of some sort the more you should make your excuses and back away. Today’s Mercury-Saturn link is guaranteed to mislead some people – but you don’t have to be one of them.
gemini,You may have to postpone something you were looking forward to today, but come the end of the week you will look back and be glad you were forced to change the timing. Listen to what your inner voice is trying to tell you.
gemini,Everything is right with the world. Or, if it isn’t, it soon will be. The Sun moves into your sign today and a new solar year begins. What are your dreams? What are your plans? Now is the time to get serious about them. Reach for the stars!,gemini,Decide what it is you most want to accomplish over the next 12 months, then work out what you will have to do to make it happen. There will, of course, be a price to pay but the good things in life seldom come cheap. Identify your goal and go for it.
gemini,What you most need to realize on your birthday is that it’s never too late to change direction or even to start again. If things are not working out the way you want them to then be bold in the changes you make. Remember: this is not a rehearsal, this is the real thing.
gemini,Lady Luck may not have been on your side too often in recent weeks but that’s okay. Now that the Sun is moving through your sign you will make up for all the heartaches and missed opportunities. It’s good to see you smiling again!,gemini,What other people are doing or saying is of no importance to you. Your needs and desires are unique and you have every right to pursue them in whatever ways you feel is most appropriate to you. The future is an open book. Start writing a new chapter today.
gemini,For quite some time now you have been doing too many things for too many people and hardly anything for yourself. That must change. Start putting your own needs first this week – and recognize that your desires are important too.
gemini,Follow your dream wherever it may take you over the coming 12 months and always believe you have a right to be happy. Some people may urge caution but you must not listen to them. Life is supposed to be an adventure, so be brave and take chances.
gemini,A new moon on your birthday means the year ahead will be extra special. However, as Neptune, planet of illusion, is strong as well you must make sure your aims are well defined. Identify your number one ambition and stick with it through to completion.
gemini,You may be a bit touchy over the next 24 hours. With your ruler Mercury moving into sensitive Cancer if there is anything worrying you it is sure to show up. Don’t try to avoid it – in fact you must confront it. It’s really no big deal.
gemini,The tempo of life has picked up a lot of late and it will pick up even more today and over the weekend. Can you stand the pace? Of course you can: you’re a Gemini and you think and act twice as fast as most other people.
gemini,You can, if you wish, force others to do your bidding this weekend but what is the point when they would quite willingly do what you ask of them anyway? All you have to do is ask nicely – you certainly don’t need to be aggressive.
gemini,Don’t give too much away this week. Keep your plans to yourself, or at least keep them vague. The more others know about what you are planning the more likely it is they will oppose you. Secrecy can be made to work in your favor.
gemini,There will be times this year when it seems as if you are the only sane person left in the world – and maybe you are. There is no point trying to change them – your one and only task is to use your insight and intelligence to improve your own conditions.
gemini,Don’t make too many plans today because most likely they will have to be changed later on. Just go with the flow and trust that the tide of events will wash you up some place that is to your liking. Always be flexible.
gemini,Some sort of challenge will confront you today but you will overcome it with ease. Take action quickly and decisively and don’t doubt for a moment that you will succeed – good things are coming your way, maybe sooner than you expect.
gemini,Today’s Sun-Uranus link will give you some remarkable ideas and insights but it is what you do with them that matters. Dreams are fun, and necessary too, but are they the sort of dreams that can be turned into realities? Think about it.
gemini,You will have plenty to say for yourself over the coming year but because Mercury turns retrograde on your birthday you must make sure your opinions are backed up by facts. If you can do that then your words will have a hugely beneficial impact.
gemini,Saturn, planet of limitation, is strong on your birthday this year, which means you need to get realistic about what is and is not possible, both in your personal life and in your career. Decide on your number one goal and move towards it a step at a time.
gemini,No matter how big your workload may be you are advised to take it easy today. According to the planets you will be too impatient to do the best job you can do, so better to avoid certain tasks than make a mess of them.
gemini,The more work you were hoping to do today the more the cosmos will conspire to hold you back and limit what you achieve. Now that you know that you can stop flogging yourself half to death and take the breather you need.
gemini,You could make an issue of something that annoys you but is it worth the effort? There are so many things going right for you now that you can afford to let minor annoyances pass you by. If it doesn’t make you smile, give it a miss.
gemini,Jupiter in the main financial area of your chart suggests you could come into money today – but it also warns you could lose it as quickly as it arrives. Don’t let rivals play on your greed – it’s very much your weak spot right now.
gemini,You must not let others dictate to you in any way, shape or form, because once they get the idea that you can be ordered about they will make your life a misery. Make sure they know you can bite as well as you bark.
gemini,You will start a lot of new things this weekend but there is a danger you may not finish any of them. It would be wiser, of course, to start fewer things and make a better job of them. Or is that too simple a solution for your tastes?,gemini,The planets warn if you get impatient with someone who is moving too slowly for your liking it will only make matters worse. Make allowances for those who do not share your speed of thought or action – yes, that’s most people!,gemini,The last few weeks have been enjoyable to say the least and there is no reason why the next few days should not be fun as well. However, with Mercury, your ruler, moving retrograde now some issues really do need to be taken seriously.
gemini,Will this be a year of great achievement or will it be a year when you promise much but deliver little? The answer to that question depends on how well you define your goals. What is it you really want from life? Make that your one and only target.
gemini,A year from now you will look back and be astounded at how far you have come – and how much fun you had along the way. Enjoy every good thing fate sends you and never doubt that you have earned them. It’s your destiny to be happy.
gemini,You pride yourself on being supremely rational but with Mercury, your ruler, moving retrograde at the moment not every thought you have will be based entirely on reason. Don’t be too stubborn – there are times when it’s okay to change your mind.
gemini,The Sun is about to leave your birth sign and it won’t be long before you notice a difference in the direction your life seems to be taking. The important thing is that you don’t try to stop the inevitable. Swim with the current, not against it.
gemini,Life has been good to you of late but you know what they say: all good things must come to an end. The Sun leaves your sign today but the positive news is there is still a large luck factor working in your favor. Make use of it.
gemini,You have a lot to do over the next few days and if others cannot keep up with your relentless pace that’s too bad. Do what you have to and don’t worry about those who fall behind. Look out for your own needs this week.
gemini,This is potentially one of the best days of the year for you as Venus, planet of emotional and material values, moves into your birth sign. Good things will come at you from all directions – the only problem is it may be overwhelming.
gemini,The next few days will be memorable – hopefully for the right reasons. You are more likely to enjoy yourself if you let go of hang-ups and allow yourself to enjoy what life has to offer. If you’re not smiling then you’re doing it wrong.
gemini,You may be tempted to take what you want today, simply because you know that you can, but maybe you should look a little further ahead and think how it might affect a relationship. What goes around tends to come around eventually.
gemini,You will get what you deserve today and tomorrow – no more and no less. If you have worked hard you will gain in ways that delight you, but if you have stayed within your comfort zone the rewards will be limited.
gemini,What happens today will remind you that money is not the most important thing in the world. Yes, of course, you need to make a living but that does not mean you should put material things ahead of everything else. What about love?,gemini,Make it your business to find out what is wrong with a partner or loved one, then make it your business to put it right. That may sound like a tall order but most likely it’s a problem that can quite easily be corrected.
gemini,Be honest with yourself about what it is you desire and be ready to walk away if, as seems likely, the only way to get what you need is to cut your links with the past. Yesterday is over – it’s all about today and tomorrow.
gemini,So many things will change over the next few days – and mostly they will be nice things. The planets are about to reward you for all the efforts you made but that is not an invitation to stop there. Keep the momentum going.
gemini,What you say over the next 24 hours may come as a shock to some people but those who know you better will have seen it coming a long way off. You’ve held your tongue for too long – now it’s time to tell it like it is.
gemini,You seem to be in a hugely positive mood now that Mercury, your ruler, is moving in your favor again. However, other aspects warn this is no time to rest on your laurels. There is still a lot more good you can do in the world.
gemini,With Venus moving through your birth sign you seem to be more mellow than you usually are and that is surely a good thing. It’s also a necessary thing as something is about to happen that takes you completely by surprise.
gemini,There will be times today when you could scream at people who refuse to see sense but if you are wise you will keep quiet. Your way of doing things may indeed be best but no amount of persuasion or threats will change their minds.
gemini,You have to decide whether a partnership of some kind is worth carrying on with or whether it has come to the end of the road. You know what the answer is already but you may be reluctant to admit it to yourself. Be brave.
gemini,The most important thing this coming week is that you identify your priorities. The second most important thing is that you stick with them. The more you chop and change the more likely it is you will achieve less than you expected.
gemini,There are times when it is right to act on a hunch and this is one of them. With surprises planet Uranus strong in your chart you should not only listen to your inner voice but act on what it is so clearly telling you.
gemini,It may be tempting to neglect certain responsibilities but it would also be a mistake. Others are watching you closely and if you cut corners or leave a job unfinished it won’t do your reputation a whole lot of good. Make an effort.
gemini,Try not to be suspicious if someone offers you for free the one thing you really desire today. Yes, of course, it could be a trick, but it could also be a sign that they genuinely want to see you find happiness.
gemini,Try not to come across as too assertive or aggressive. A lot will depend over the next few days on your ability to meet others halfway, especially in areas where there is money at stake. Win people over, don’t turn them against you.
gemini,Something you have feared for a long time will make an unwelcome appearance over the next 24 hours but it’s actually very good news because this time you will have to deal with it. You’re more courageous than you think you are.
gemini,Listen carefully to what others are saying today because you might get lucky and hear something that could make you some money. It is remarkable what you can pick up simply by being aware of what is taking place around you.
gemini,Whatever you choose to do over the next few days life will be anything but dull. You’re a social animal by nature, so dress up and hit the town. Put serious matters out of your mind – for you it’s now party season.
gemini,If you need to do something that is going to take a lot of physical energy then now is the time. Also, don’t wait to be offered something you are in a position to take for yourself. Be bold, be brave and be the first into action.
gemini,Even if your current situation is not as good as you would like it to be it won’t be long before it improves, so don’t be so pessimistic. A week from now the Sun will move into one of the more positive areas of your chart.
gemini,You will find it easier to put your point of view across as from today, which is nice. Even nicer is that you will discover that family and friends are on your side, which has not always been the case in recent weeks.
gemini,You will get the chance to do things for friends and family members today but make sure they don’t take advantage of you. Also, being of service does not mean you can’t have fun as well. Treat yourself over the next 24 hours.
gemini,Anything of a creative nature will go well for you today – and you could make some money from it too. Your number one aim is, of course, to enjoy what you are doing, but if it helps your finances too that’s a happy bonus.
gemini,You need to take control of your current situation, rather than let other people decide what you will do and when you will do it. You were born to be a leader, not a follower, so get your act together and let everyone know you’re the boss.
gemini,Something will happen over the next few days that proves you were right and your rivals were wrong. Will you gloat? Of course you will! Enjoy your moment of triumph. Treat yourself and your friends to a victory celebration – then move on.
gemini,You have enough work on your plate as it is, so don’t take on any more. The planets warn if you go beyond your limits now you will regret it later in the week when you don’t have the energy to take advantage of new opportunities.
gemini,You may want to be on the move but the planets indicate it will pay you to stay right where you are and get your thoughts and emotions in order. An exceptionally busy phase is about to begin, but you must be calm today.
gemini,There is no point worrying about how you are going to make ends meet. You know from experience that something always comes up. In fact, you are one of those people who, no matter how far they fall, always seem to land on their feet.
gemini,Use your mind more over the next 24 hours. Take on mental challenges that at other times might confuse or bemuse you. The more you make use of your brain power the more you will gain, not just intellectually but financially too.
gemini,You have nothing to prove and everything to look forward to. That is the message of the stars today and even if you don’t quite believe it now you will over the weekend. The universe wants you to have fun – and you’re good at that!,gemini,Don’t waste time arguing the toss with people whose views you do not respect. You know what is right and what is wrong and that’s all that matters – you certainly don’t have to try to persuade those who can’t see the truth.
gemini,Keep your suspicions to yourself, not because they are wrong but because you should be looking for the best in people, not the worst. No one is perfect, not even you, so turn a blind eye to others’ failings over the next seven days.
gemini,There is no point trying to make sense of what’s going on. The more you try to analyze the situation the more complicated it will look, so leave well alone and focus on things you feel comfortable with and can change without fuss.
gemini,The closer you work with other people today the more likely it is you will share in something that brings great benefits to everyone, both personal and professional. Joint efforts will bring bigger rewards than if you had worked on your own.
gemini,One huge effort may get you past some kind of obstacle but will it have an adverse effect on your health? The planets urge you to take a more relaxed attitude to what you think you have to do. Will it wait? Of course it will.
gemini,Shove any worries you might have to the back of your mind and have fun today. The Sun in Leo at this time of year brings all sorts of social and travel opportunities your way and it would be criminal not to take advantage of them.
gemini,With the Sun, Jupiter and now Mercury, your ruler, moving through one of the more positive areas of your chart you will find it easy to hit targets that in the past you assumed were too high for you. Reach for the sky!,gemini,This is an excellent time for travel and social activities and with Mercury, your ruler, on good terms with larger-than-life Jupiter this weekend life will be one big party. You could also meet someone you fall head over heels for.
gemini,Do something special over the next few days, something that gets you noticed and marks you out not just as a thinker but as a doer as well. Don’t sit back waiting for opportunities to come to you – go out and create them for yourself.
gemini,By all means give others a chance to put their points of view across today but once they have done so you must come down strongly in favor of your own opinion. Don’t beat about the bush: say your piece and have done with it.
gemini,If you look for the best you will surely find it, but if you look for the worst you will find that too. Everything, and everyone, has a light side and a dark side. Make it your aim to encourage the light side today.
gemini,There will be times today when it seems that for every step forward you take you end up taking two steps backwards. It may be frustrating but there is nothing much you can do about it, so go with the flow and don’t get uptight.
gemini,Whatever you turn your hand to today it will work out better than you expected. One of your strengths is that you are always willing to give something a go – especially when the doubters tell you it cannot be done. Have fun proving them wrong.
gemini,Today’s Sun-Mercury link will do wonders for your confidence and also your popularity. Just remember that it’s not possible to accept each and every invitation, social or professional, that comes your way. There’s only so much of you to go around!,gemini,You get a kick out of being different and will happily upset those you consider to be too conservative in their thinking. But when you dish it out you have to be ready to take it as well. You won’t get it all your own way.
gemini,Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good but this week you will go right the other way and hit back at whoever is giving you a hard time. You are under no obligation to be nice to people who are not nice to you.
gemini,If you give in to your emotions and start shouting back at people who raise their voices for no good reason today you will be the loser. Calm yourself. There is nothing to be gained by getting worked up about trivial issues.
gemini,Don’t worry if you have not yet made a serious start on a project that means a lot to you because you will get your chance over the next two or three days. Think before you act – and keep your emotions out of it.
gemini,The planets will help you make the break you have been dreaming of but it won’t happen as if by magic – the effort must come from you. If you don’t make that move now, or at least by the end of the week, when will you make it?,gemini,Cosmic activity in the work area of your chart makes this a good time to get started on things of a practical nature. Set yourself targets but make sure they are ones you can reach. There is no point putting yourself under pressure.
gemini,You may not agree with what a friend or loved one tells you they have been up to but resist the urge to say outright that it is wrong. It may not be what you would do in the same situation but different people have different values.
gemini,You will get advice from all directions today but the only advice you need will come from that small voice inside you. Not only does it know the right answers but it knows the right questions too, which is far more important.
gemini,You need to take a more practical view of your family or your financial situation, because only when you know what the problem is can you start to do something about it. Enjoy your dreams but don’t lose sight of reality.
gemini,Love planet Venus urges you to let that special someone know they are the best thing that ever happened to you. Don’t keep your feelings locked up inside – speak up now and the romantic glow will last until the end of the year.
gemini,Some people love making a drama out of things that are not even remotely a crisis. There is no point trying to persuade them there is nothing to worry about because they will not be convinced. All you can do is to keep your distance.
gemini,You can usually be counted on to act rationally, but the planets will make that more difficult than usual over the next 24 hours. If you find yourself getting emotional for no good reason remind yourself of all the things you have to be thankful for.
gemini,Duties and chores will take up a large slice of your time today, time you would no doubt prefer to spend socializing. Do what has to be done and do it well – then you won’t have to go back and do it again later.
gemini,A money matter you thought has been resolved will be up in the air again over the next few days and the good news is if you move fast you can be the one who benefits the most. You need some extra cash.
gemini,You must assert your authority over the next 48 hours. The planets will in some way or other put you on the spot and others will be watching closely how you deal with the situation. Be tough. Let them know you won’t be intimidated.
gemini,Monday’s new moon will bring new opportunities but they will be the kind of opportunities that you need help with to make the most of. Get your nearest and dearest involved – you’ve been drifting a bit too far apart of late.
gemini,Don’t keep your feelings bottled up inside you. Let them out so they can be dealt with. Gemini may be one of the zodiac’s more rational signs but you have an irrational side too. It’s okay to shout and scream a bit occasionally.
gemini,The challenges you face over the next few days will be of a minor nature, so try not to get worked up about them. Also, don’t take it personally if someone says something less than flattering about you. It’s just their opinion.
gemini,A difference of opinion may be annoying but in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance, so don’t go to war over it. You should be confident enough in your own beliefs that you don’t need other people’s approval.
gemini,If you sit quietly and let your inner voice speak to you today you will get the answers you have been looking for. Never doubt there is meaning to your existence – and never stop trying to find out what it is.
gemini,Like it or not there are duties and responsibilities you cannot avoid and the sooner you get on with them the sooner you will be able to move on to more interesting activities. Also, make sure you do a good job – it’s quality that counts.
gemini,You need to deal with a situation that really should have been sorted a long time ago. Fortunately, with Mercury, your ruler, moving in your favor over the next few days you will see what needs to be done and get on with it immediately.
gemini,The planets are giving you a massive boost of confidence and all you have to do to succeed is focus on your number one goal. Anyone who comes between you and what you are after will wish they had stayed out of your way.
gemini,You may be independent by nature but even a Gemini needs help sometimes and you will need it over the next 24 hours. With Mercury, moving into the most sociable area of your chart speak up and you’ll get all the assistance you require.
gemini,Make sure you know all the facts before getting involved in a feud of some sort. You may want to help and bring people back together, but if you are unaware of what is really going on you may end up making the situation even worse.
gemini,Sacrifices of one kind or another will have to be made over the next few weeks but they are worth it. The important thing is that you stay calm and don’t do anything drastic such as borrowing money from one person to pay back another.
gemini,Venus, planet of values, urges you to be a bit more understanding of someone who has let you down in some way. Almost certainly they didn’t mean to. Almost certainly it was an accident. There is no reason at all to be bitter.
gemini,Your arguments may sound convincing to you but it would appear other people are not convinced and that could cause problems this weekend. Try to remember that everyone is different and everyone has their own way of interpreting the facts.
gemini,Life may be good to you at the moment but a partner or loved one is having a tough time of things. Take time out from what you are doing and offer a consoling word or helping hand. Your kindness will be appreciated.
gemini,You have friends in high places and you must make better use of them. There is no valid reason why you should miss out on the good things simply because you think it is wrong to give yourself an advantage over your rivals.
gemini,Actions speak louder than words, so if you have fallen out with a friend or colleague do whatever it take to get past the situation. You don’t want the dispute to drag on indefinitely, and neither do they, so work something out.
gemini,Neptune can be a disruptive influence and because it is now at odds with love planet Venus it could have a negative effect on affairs of the heart. Promises made in the heat of the night are easily broken in the cold light of day.
gemini,Your physical and emotional reserves are likely to be a bit depleted at the moment, so take it easy today and tomorrow. There are a number of ways you can improve your health and streamline your working routine without being silly about it.
gemini,The cosmic picture will be changing over the next few days and with Mars moving into your opposite sign you may find that minor problems loom a lot larger than before. Don’t worry – you’ll find ways to deal with them.
gemini,A personal relationship will come under strain this weekend and your commitment will certainly be tested. Whatever the challenge you must face it together and, hopefully, triumph together. The bond between you will be stronger than ever.
gemini,However much you care for a certain individual you know better than to involve yourself too deeply in their personal affairs. If you get the chance to offer some appropriate advice today that’s okay but don’t force your opinions on them. ,gemini,You may have to devote the daylight hours to work-related matters but once the Sun goes down your thoughts will be on having fun. As far as romance is concerned a secret crush you have is unlikely to stay secret much longer.
gemini,If you have a favor to ask of a friend or family member, now is the time. The planets indicate that for reasons which may not be entirely clear everyone wants to help you today. You would be foolish not to take advantage of it.
gemini,Not everything will go the way you want it to go today but those things which do work out right will far outnumber those things which don’t. A domestic or romantic dispute can now easily be resolved – IF you are willing to say sorry first.
gemini,If you get the chance to improve your cashflow situation you must take it. Your ability to think on your feet and to make quick and correct decisions means you will be much in demand today. Be sure to make it pay.
gemini,Your priority now must be to get out into the world and do what Geminis do best – have fun Career and money worries can be left until another day, or another week, or another month. Okay, go the whole hog – leave them for another year.
gemini,You enjoy the limelight and you will certainly get the chance to put on a show over the next 48 hours. It’s good that you like being the center of attention because it will happen often over the next four or five weeks.
gemini,If you feel restless and ill at ease don’t sweat it – you will get the chance to ring the changes when the Sun moves in your favor this coming Tuesday. What you have to leave behind will be eclipsed by what awaits you in a new environment.
gemini,Don’t worry about money or career problems because the Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you will soon have more enjoyable issues to focus on. Problems will remain, of course, but your attitude towards them will be much more positive.
gemini,According to the planets you are overreacting to what is really a quite minor event, but the good news is that with the Sun now moving into the most positive area of your chart you will soon get over it. Make having fun your mission.
gemini,You will get a clear picture in your mind’s eye today of what it is you want out of life and what you will have to do to get it. After that it’s up to you – do you have the ambition and staying power to make it happen?,gemini,You will tackle even the most difficult tasks with ease today. A wonderful aspect between the heavyweight planets Jupiter and Uranus means you are in tune with the spirit of the times, so sing along and find fun in everything you do.
gemini,The setbacks and disappointments of recent months can now be seen in a much more positive light. Even when you were on the receiving end of bad news it was teaching you and toughening you up – and now you will thrive.
gemini,No doubt you know where you are going and no doubt you know what needs to be done to get from here to there but don’t close your ears to other people’s advice. A friend’s or loved one’s experiences could be invaluable.
gemini,You are on course to accomplish something remarkable, even more so if you have a clear idea of the target you are aiming for. A burst of activity over the next few days will produce the kind of results it usually takes months to put together.
gemini,A completely unexpected event will throw you off your stride today but that’s okay. You will still be heading in roughly the right direction and if you get there a bit later and by a roundabout route it’s no big deal.
gemini,Don’t stay silent today just because you worry you might upset someone who has the power to make life difficult for you. Chances are they respect your opinions more than you realize and will respect them even more if you make your point honestly.
gemini,Something you take for granted will be changed beyond recognition over the next few days. But seeing as it is so clearly a change for the better you won’t be in the least bit worried. In fact you may wish it had happened sooner.
gemini,You can afford to take a few risks today where affairs of the heart are concerned. Don’t be afraid to reveal your innermost feelings to the one whose affections you are after – they will most likely respond in similar fashion.
gemini,What exactly is it that you most desire? Vague feelings won’t do – you need to be as specific as you can if you are to have any real hope of making your dream come true. Imagine it, desire it, embrace it, then own it!,gemini,This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you on just about every level, so don’t sit at home all weekend – get out there and show the world what you are about. Star quality is rare, but you’ve got tons of it.
gemini,Certain people may say you are under an obligation to get involved in their problems and their causes but you’re not. It is entirely up to you what you do and don’t do and what you support and don’t support. Don’t let them intimidate you.
gemini,Something may look simple on the surface but if you dig a little deeper over the next 24 hours you will find it is anything but. If you can, stand back a little and view what’s going on from a wider perspective. You’ll get the picture.
gemini,Be firm and decisive and don’t let anyone tell you that you are not entitled to enjoy the good things in life. Too often in the past you have held back while those less talented but with bigger egos have pushed ahead. Time to reverse that.
gemini,Something extraordinary is about to happen in your life – you just know it. Today’s eclipse will sweep away obstacles and enable you to turn what has until now been merely a dream into a real-life achievement. Show the world you mean business.
gemini,Your approach to a certain situation may be ridiculed by those who think you are doomed to failure but they won’t be laughing when they see you make a success of it. Never be afraid to go your own way and do your own thing.
gemini,According to the planets you are in danger of making a simple situation more complicated than it needs to be. Relax, take your time and let your inner voice guide you. It knows the way and all you have to do is follow.
gemini,Expect some surprises where your ideals, beliefs and friendships are concerned this weekend. Or maybe the opposite will happen and what you thought would be a surprise turns out to be entirely predictable. With Uranus involved, you just can’t tell.
gemini,Things will work out well for you over the next few days, even though you may be convinced that Lady Luck has deserted you. Get rid of that pessimistic attitude and believe that you are the luckiest person alive – because you are! ,gemini,What you most need to ask yourself today is this: is the cause I am fighting for really worth the effort? Maybe you are already beginning to suspect that the answer is “no”. In which case you need to start backing away from it.
gemini,Your enthusiasm for a project will reach new heights today but don’t just throw yourself at it in one mad rush. A little bit of planning now will lead to huge benefits later in the year, so put in the brain work first.
gemini,The task you have set yourself may seem a bit scary but if you have confidence in yourself and if you act as if you cannot lose it will be a great success. What seems most difficult for you now is in fact extremely easy.
gemini,Life is good and getting better by the moment, so why are you so fearful? No doubt it has something to do with Mercury, your ruler, in one of its retrograde phases. Don’t worry. No matter what happens in the short-term, the long-term outlook is rosy.
gemini,Don’t push yourself too hard physically or worry that you are not giving enough mentally or emotionally. Even a Gemini needs to slow down a bit once in a while and with your ruler Mercury still moving retrograde this is the ideal time.
gemini,Try not to overreact to minor problems over the next few days or they could develop into major issues for no good reason. You would rather deal with a genuine crisis than a petty dispute and the Sun’s change of signs on Thursday could make it happen.
gemini,You may have to cut back on your commitments in order to save time and money but don’t overdo it. Jupiter, planet of excess, is strong in your chart today, so there is a danger you could go too far. Avoid all kinds of extremes.
gemini,Take something that seems ordinary and turn it into something special over the next 24 hours. You cannot escape your commitments but you can make life easier for yourself by taking a more active interest in the passing events of everyday life.
gemini,Any minor health worries you have must be dealt with over the next 48 hours. Most likely you have absolutely nothing to fear, physically at least, but it won’t hurt to get a professional opinion, if only to put your mind at ease.
gemini,What you need to remember today is that every cause has an effect. The planets indicate that something is about to happen that is directly linked to what you said or did in the dim and distant past. What goes around comes around.
gemini,Don’t brood about big things you cannot change. Instead, focus on small things you can do right now, at this very moment. No matter how mundane they may be if you keep at it your small steps will become giant strides.
gemini,You don’t mind challenges, in fact you quite like them, but there are limits and the pressure you are currently under is becoming a burden to say the least. The fact is you have brought a lot of it on yourself. Find ways to slow down and relax.
gemini,You can do many things but one thing you have never been much good at is reading minds. If someone requires your help today they must come right out and ask for it. Only when you know what they want can you give them what they need.
gemini,Neptune’s negative influence is eroding your confidence and exposing you to fears and worries that really are not warranted. Fortunately, your current negative state of mind is unlikely to last. You’re just too fun-loving to be down for long.
gemini,You may think you know all you need to know about a friend or colleague but over the next 24 hours you will find out things about them that you had not even guessed at. Seems they have hidden depths – just like you.
gemini,It may sadden you that a friend or family member clearly feels unhappy with what you are doing but that’s just the way it is. The more you try to convince them it’s okay the more anti they are likely to get, so let it pass.
gemini,The Sun in the work area of your chart means you have a number of duties and responsibilities to attend to and, although you might prefer to ignore them, you feel honor bound to do what is expected of you. You will be well rewarded.
gemini,The road ahead of you may not look too inviting but once you are on the move you will find that the journey is not so bad. The fact is you can find something to enjoy in any direction you travel — it’s largely a state of mind.
gemini,You may think you have energy to spare today but in reality your physical batteries are running low, so don’t take on any new responsibilities. Despite what some people might say you don’t have to burn the candle at both ends to succeed. ,gemini,There are two ways you can deal with a problem: the quick way that calms things down in the short-term but does not guarantee it won’t return; or the long way that takes more time and effort but is ultimately more effective. You know which is best.
gemini,According to the planets you are working too hard and need to take a break. Everyone needs time to relax and enjoy the finer things in life and you need it more than most at the present moment. Work can wait – peace of mind cannot. ,gemini,A problem related to your work is not as difficult to solve as you imagine and the answer will be obvious once you ignore the usual solutions and try something different. Remember too that you don’t have to do it all yourself.
gemini,Start thinking about ways you can make your working routine less stressful. You may not get the chance to put your ideas into effect immediately but by the middle part of next week you will be glad you made the effort.
gemini,Knowing what you don’t want to do can be every bit as valuable as knowing what you do want to do, especially if it helps you make some kind of choice. Just be aware this week that you don’t have to make that choice immediately.
gemini,You will start the week inspired mentally and overflowing with energy physically. If you can apply your talents in the right direction there is no limit to what you can achieve over the next four or five days. If you can think it you can do it too.
gemini,You may be worried about taking a risk with your resources but what alternatives do you have? Not many. You of all people should know that if you stick to the same old routine you will keep on getting the same old results. ,gemini,You have something important to say and you should say it both loudly and immediately. The longer you allow something that annoys or upsets you to continue the worse it will get, so speak up and, if necessary, provoke a showdown. ,gemini,You enjoy a certain amount of drama in your life but you need stability too and today you will be delighted to discover there are people you can trust and turn to when the going gets tough. Ask for help and you will get it instantly.
gemini,Try not to exaggerate your troubles today, because with the Sun at odds with Jupiter, planet of expansion, things could easily get out of control. Loved ones and work colleagues are in no mood to encourage feelings of self-pity.
gemini,It may appear as if some people lead more glamorous lives than you but from their point of view you seem to be having fun as well. Don’t envy what others have got – simply make more of your own skills and talents.
gemini,Friends and loved ones may think you have taken leave of your senses but you know that the course of action you are contemplating is right for you. A change of scene will do you the world of good – a change of outlook even more so.
gemini,You may be tempted to bulldoze your way through obstacles today but is that really such a good idea? Why risk causing trouble when you can get what you need by less provocative methods? Might sometimes makes right, but not today.
gemini,Stop being so suspicious and accept that what people say is what they mean. If a friend or work colleague has promised to do something for you then you must trust that they intend to deliver. Don’t keep going on about it.
gemini,Ignore those who urge you to take a more “balanced” approach. If you want something enough you must go out and get it, regardless of whose toes you might be treading on. Don’t give an inch – in fact tread on those toes even harder.
gemini,This may be a difficult time but you don’t have to let it get on top of you. On the work front it would appear that someone has got into the habit of expecting you to do all the work. Maybe it’s time to turn round and say “no”. ,gemini,An idea you have may seem impractical to some but you have total faith in your own abilities. You are not the sort to be put off just because something is new or untested – that’s what makes it exciting and worth the effort. ,gemini,If a friend suggests a course of action you are not too sure about, go along with it anyway. You always like to be in control of your own destiny but on this occasion you could do worse than put yourself in their capable hands.
gemini,If others expect you to act in ways you do not enjoy then obviously something is wrong. You don’t have to do what they want you to do. You certainly do not have to play a role that feels alien to you. Be yourself. ,gemini,If nothing adds up it can only be because you are using the wrong measuring tool. Put your current beliefs and attitudes aside for a few hours and everything will soon be crystal clear. Your life actually makes perfect sense. ,gemini,If you can imagine something then you can do it as well. What you visualize over the next 24 hours is what you will be able to do in weeks to come, so don’t dismiss what are genuine insights as fantasy or wishful thinking.
gemini,Is what you are doing with your life meaningful? Most likely it is but there may be moments today when your confidence wavers and doubts creep in. Try to understand that whatever path you are on it is the right one for you.
gemini,When you want something enough you let nothing stand in your way, which is good. What is not so good is if you climb over other people to get it. Mercury in your opposite sign as from today encourages you to be more diplomatic.
gemini,Be spontaneous, be original, be the one who stands out from the crowd. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Sagittarius means you won’t always get the level of support you would like but the fact is you really don’t need it.
gemini,There are several things you can do to make sure the week ahead of you is relaxed and enjoyable. Clear up the backlog of jobs you started but never quite got round to completing on Monday and Tuesday. After that, you time is your own.
gemini,Mars in the wealth area of your chart means you have important financial arrangements to deal with and you must do so from a position of strength. Know your own worth and don’t accept anything less. A top job deserves top dollar payment. ,gemini,You will need to be tough, maybe even ruthless, if you are to protect your interests against those who would like to see you fail. Emotional and material security is important to you but you will only get it if you fight for it.  ,gemini,Your present location may seem exactly right for you but when Mars changes signs tomorrow new options will present themselves and you will start to think about making a move. You rarely stay in one place for long.
gemini,There will be all sorts of opportunities to improve yourself, personally and professionally, over the next few days but there will also be challenges that force you to make far-reaching changes. Take the rough with the smooth.
gemini,The approaching full moon will affect you more than most because it takes place in your sign, and if you get through the next two or three days emotionally unscathed you can count yourself lucky! Try not to take anything too seriously.
gemini,You will get the chance to settle a long-running emotional dispute this weekend and you must do so without hesitation. Even if you believe that you have nothing to apologize for it won’t do you any good to prolong the feud.
gemini,You may regret not having more time enjoy your social life but there is a reason you are having to focus on more serious matters. Clear you mind of negative thoughts and you will see there is a positive pattern to recent events.
gemini,Get out into the world and have a good time. The more people you meet on your travels the better as they will open your eyes to new possibilities. And if some people do not approve of your gallivanting? Do it even more! ,gemini,It may look as if you are the only one who knows what’s going on at the moment but the planets warn you could be kidding yourself. It might be wise not to trust everything your five senses tell you over the next 24 hours. ,gemini,Stick to the facts today, especially when dealing with money matters. If you are tempted to make a decision for sentimental reasons it could easily backfire on you, so be cautious and make sure your cash stays where it belongs – in your pocket.
gemini,You will have to make sacrifices over the next few days but that’s okay. You will get your reward later in the month when the Sun moves in your favor again – and it will be worth the wait. Today, try to avoid conflicts at work.
gemini,You may feel a little worn out after the excitement of the past few days but don’t switch off completely because there are still important things that need to be done. Use your Gemini way with words to get others to do the hard stuff for you. ,gemini,You will want to be on the move this weekend but friends and loved ones will want you to stay right where you are. Something will have to give and no way should it be you. If one place bores you just move to another.
gemini,The planets urge you to knuckle down and create something of lasting value this week. Don’t worry if certain people make fun of your aims – most likely they are jealous of your talent and secretly fear you will succeed. They’re right, you will.
gemini,You may be fired with enthusiasm for a new plan or project but not everyone is convinced. Does that matter? Only if you care about their opinions. Your best course of action is to just get on and do what feels right to you. ,gemini,Be careful you don’t bite off more than you can chew today, especially if you are trying to impress important people. The best way to influence them is to just be yourself. If you’ve got what it takes – and you have – they will notice. ,gemini,Someone will try to persuade you to part with some of your cash today and you must turn them down flat. Just because they’ve had a good idea does not mean you have to finance it, and certainly not without a binding contract.
gemini,This is a time of major changes for you, especially on an inner level. Those changes will accelerate when the Sun moves into Capricorn at the weekend, so treat yourself gently and get plenty of rest. You will most likely need it! ,gemini,You will be torn between conflicting duties today and whichever one you choose to prioritize someone, somewhere is not going to like it. In which case it might be better to forget about everyone else and put your own needs first for a change.
gemini,Be careful you don’t let slip information that could either be used against you or used to make money at your expense. You may be outgoing and chatty by nature but there are times when even a Gemini should keep quiet. ,gemini,Be on your guard this week because the planets warn that someone you do business with may try to cheat you. On the other hand they also warn that you could overreact, so make sure you are certain of the facts before making accusations.
gemini,Keep your wits about you today or you could lose out financially. Someone you think is a friend is actually a secret rival, so don’t take anything for granted and don’t accept what they tell you without checking it out for yourself. ,gemini,There will be some remarkable developments in the final few days of the year, which is great, but you would be wise to conserve your energy today and tomorrow. The less you do now the more you will gain later on. ,gemini,If your inner voice urges you to take a risk then that is exactly what you should do, even if everyone else tells you not to be foolish. Maybe they’re right, maybe you are taking unnecessary chances, but your instincts are too strong to resist. ,gemini,Keep personal information to yourself today. You may be tempted to bare your soul and let a certain person now what you have been going through but the planets warn that is not a good idea. If one knows then soon everyone will know. ,gemini,Even a Gemini has limits and it will be pretty clear over the next few days what they are. In areas where you are lacking in experience you must let others take the lead. Fortunately you are rarely lacking in common sense. ,gemini,The most important thing now and over the new year period is that you stay on good terms with partners and colleagues. No matter what others may say or do you must not overreact. Don’t make enemies of people who should be friends.
gemini,You will be tempted to ignore some kind of problem today in the hope that it will go away – and you are right to do so. This is one of those problems that is only a problem if you think it is a problem. So don’t think of it at all. ,gemini,What happens over the next 24 hours will reassure you that everything is fine. In fact, by the time Venus moves in your favor next weekend you will come to the conclusion that you have been worrying for no good reason. ,gemini,If you are smart you won’t take what someone tells you too seriously today, especially if there is money at stake. If you fall for a story that is obviously untrue it will be you who pays for it in the long-term. ,gemini,Make an effort to pursue a new interest because the planets suggest it will become increasingly important to you over the next few months. Don’t worry that others think you are wasting your time – you will soon be having the time of your life. ,gemini,You have big plans for the future but make sure they are not too big. Even a Gemini has limits and your main task now is to identify what those limits are so you can work within them. It’s not about weakness, it’s about common sense. ,gemini,Positive thinking is a must this weekend because if you dwell on what is going wrong in your life you will miss all the wonderful things that are going right. Forget about your chores and do something purely for the fun of it. ,gemini,Wherever you go and whatever you do you will have no end of fun this week. The only dark cloud on the horizon is tomorrow’s full moon which may bring one or two money problems. Promise yourself you won’t spend too much. ,gemini,The more you worry about a money problem the more power you give it, so put it out of your mind and focus on something more positive. Looking back from later in the week you will realize there was nothing to worry about anyway. ,gemini,You will find yourself at odds with someone in a position of authority today and you may have no choice but to back down, even though you believe you are in the right. It’s simply not worth putting your livelihood at risk. ,gemini,Your current big idea may indeed be wonderful but don’t shout about it too loudly. In fact you should keep it to yourself at least until the end of the week – by which time you will most likely have changed your mind. ,gemini,You will find yourself in a heated discussion with a friend or work colleague today and no way are you going to back down. Why should you when you know that you are right and they are wrong? There is no need to compromise. ,gemini,If you are having second thoughts about something you recently agreed to there is still time to change your mind. Others may not be happy about it but your conscience must come first. Better you pull out now than hate yourself later. ,gemini,You may have been tough on various people in recent weeks but you will be a lot more friendly over the next 48 hours. You have been Mr. Nasty and now it is time to be Mr. Nice. If nothing else it will keep your rivals confused.
gemini,Someone in a position of power may give you a tough time during the early part of the week but that’s okay because you can be pretty tough yourself when the need arises. You have both right and might on your side, so use them.
gemini,Whatever you want out of life you will find a way to get, but you will get it quicker and easier if you make friends with important people, the kind who can open doors and make things happen for you. You can’t do it all by yourself. ,gemini,A co-worker will give you a hard time over the next 24 hours but you must not give them a hard time back. The only thing they can do to actually hurt you is to provoke you into making an angry response. Don’t fall for it. ,gemini,With your ruler Mercury so strong today you are in a can-do mood but you may have to deal with people who seem incapable of making even the simplest decision for themselves. Yes, it’s frustrating but don’t lose your temper. ,gemini,Winning may not be everything but it isn’t nothing either and if you get the chance to be number one today you should take it. Mars in the career area of your chart makes it easy for you to be assertive – but don’t push it too far.
gemini,If you force yourself to be enthusiastic about a task or project you don’t really care about today you may be surprised to find that you actually quite enjoy it. You will certainly impress everyone by your dedication to duty. ,gemini,You are determined to get more out of life and because you can sense that the clock is ticking you will deal harshly with anyone who stands in your way this weekend. But what kind of fool would dare to do that? ,gemini,Anyone who thinks that you will change your plans to fit in with what they want to do clearly does not know you too well. In fact you will go out of your way to do things your way – just to let them know you’re the boss! ,gemini,So many of the things you have been worrying about will fade away over the next few days. It’s doubtful whether they existed in the first place but the important thing is you feel free at last. How are you going to use that freedom? ,gemini,If your sixth sense tells you that someone is not being honest with you then, yes, you should be on your guard. But don’t make accusations unless you can back them up with facts. You’ll look bad if you get it wrong.
gemini,Someone more experienced than you will take you under their wing over the next few days and teach you a number of things worth knowing. Amazingly they won’t ask for a favor in return – they just want to see you do well.
gemini,Someone you think of very highly indeed has been waiting for you to declare your friendship, and maybe even your passion, and if you do it today your relationship will go from good to great. So what are you waiting for?,gemini,A colleague will be less than helpful over the next 48 hours – in fact it seems they are being obstructive for the sake of it. Stay calm. If they see that it’s getting to you it will encourage them all the more. ,gemini,You have been a bit too suspicious in recent days but you will more than make up for it this week. Colleagues will be impressed by your willingness to work as part of the team – provided, of course, there is something in it for you. ,gemini,Force yourself to look on the bright side today. According to the planets you have nothing to worry about but you may have to trick your mind into believing that is so. Focus only on good things and only good things will happen. ,gemini,You seem to be in two minds which way you should now be heading. The best thing to do is wait until the end of the week when your confidence will return and you are far more likely to make the correct decision.
gemini,A friend or relative will go out of their way to do something they hope you approve of today. Even if you are not that impressed you should pretend that you are, because if you help them feel good now they will help you big time later on. ,gemini,Anyone who doubts you are a free-thinker won’t doubt it much longer. In fact, what you profess to believe over the next 24 hours will mark you out as a maverick. Are you mad or are you bad? Neither, you’re a Gemini! ,gemini,Your main aim today and over the weekend must be to push yourself harder and get the best from yourself. Believe in your abilities and believe that you are capable of more and, in time, your belief will make it a fact.
gemini,You would be wise not to make too many plans over the next 48 hours. And don’t put too much trust in other people’s plans and promises either. According to the planets friends and colleagues will say anything to try to impress you.
gemini,The coming week will be extremely lucky for you. So many things will go right that it’s like you have a special angel watching over you. Maybe you have, maybe the good fortune fairy is on your side. Make the most of it.
gemini,The coming week will be a time of great activity. You know what you want, you know where to get it – now all you have to do is find the confidence to reach out and take it. That will be easier than you imagine. ,gemini,The only danger today is that you will change your plans at the last possible moment and by doing so upset other people’s aims. It may not bother you now but it will do later when they change their own plans just to annoy you. ,gemini,You have done plenty of thinking and planning, now you must act. Don’t be half-hearted about what needs to be done – dedicate yourself to it body, mind and soul. You may be small but you can have a huge impact.
gemini,You need to make an important decision today and you need some peace and quiet so you can think and, hopefully, come to the correct conclusion. Find a place where the noise of everyday life cannot interfere with your thoughts. ,gemini,Your confidence may take a dive today but it’s no big deal. As a Gemini you are rarely down for long and come the weekend you will be full of life and laughter again. There will be love in your life too. ,gemini,If you want to move up in the world then you must make an effort to impress people in positions of power. But don’t make too big a deal of it because they will be most impressed if you make it look easy.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, ends its current retrograde phase on Wednesday, after which you will find it so much easier to make others understand what it is you are trying to say. If you’re really fortunate you may even understand it yourself! ,gemini,There can be no more excuses for putting off something you should have taken care of a long time ago. You can and you must find a way to get it done – all it takes is a bit of imagination followed by lots of application.
gemini,Someone in a position of authority will be rather critical of your work today but don’t lose heart. They know you have what it takes to succeed but they think you could do with a little push to get you going. They could be right. ,gemini,Be careful who you trust on the work front today because someone you think is a friend could be plotting to undermine your position. If you let them in on a secret they could find a way to use it against you. ,gemini,You are in one of those moods when whatever other people say you feel you have to take an opposing viewpoint. Are you being contrary for the fun of it? Maybe but what of it? Someone needs to ask the difficult questions. ,gemini,Question everything you are told today. Don’t accept things just because the “experts” tell you they are true. All too often the “experts” are actually nothing of the sort. Always think for yourself – don’t let others do it for you.
gemini,Wait a day or two before confronting someone with evidence of their wrongdoing. At the moment the evidence you have is not as watertight as you would like to believe, but they will incriminate themselves further over the weekend.
gemini,As the Sun moves into the career area of your chart this week you will have to decide if your old ambitions are worth pursuing and, if not, what you are going to pursue instead. Listen to your heart – it knows what to do. ,gemini,It may at times seem as if life is conspiring against you but what happens over the coming week will convince you that is simply not true. You may even be a little ashamed that you felt so sorry for yourself. ,gemini,You will need to keep a cool head today because something is going to happen that has others running around in all directions and getting nowhere fast. Your laid-back attitude will do a lot to restore calm to the scene. ,gemini,The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart today means you can win friends and influence people – IF you make the effort. Employers and other important people will admire your self-belief and your can-do attitude. ,gemini,According to the planets you are looking for excuses to avoid something that must be done. The simple fact is you don’t have a choice in the matter: you made an agreement and now you must keep it. Next time, don’t make promises so easily.
gemini,You are so incredibly enthusiastic about something that you cannot understand why some people are being so negative about it. Maybe it’s because they have looked at the situation in a more balanced way. Maybe they have a point.
gemini,You will find it easier than ever to get your own way, both in your personal life and at work, over the next 48 hours – all you have to do is ask. And no, there is no reason at all why you should be suspicious. There’s no catch. ,gemini,This is a good time to make an impression on employers and people in positions of authority. If you desire a promotion now is the time to do something that makes others sit up and take notice. Just make sure it’s moral, and legal. ,gemini,Just because you disagree with someone does not mean you cannot be friends. The message of the stars today – and for the rest of the week – is that differences of opinion must not be allowed to come between you. ,gemini,Someone in a position of power will say something that annoys you today, not least because it seems to cast doubts on your expertise. Don’t take it too seriously: either they did not mean it that way or they don’t know what they are talking about.
gemini,Something you have been worrying about for ages is of no real importance and what happens today will convince you of that fact once and for all. In future, try not to take what the so-called “experts” say as gospel. Listen to your inner voice instead.
gemini,Something you hear from a friend or work colleague today will make you wonder if you have taken a wrong turning. You certainly seem to be on a difficult path at the moment, so maybe you should retrace your footsteps and start again.
gemini,By all means ask other people for their opinions today but don’t let what they say bind you to a certain course of action. Others will respect you more if you act according to your own principles – which, presumably, you do have.
gemini,Try not to get too excitable over the next 48 hours because if you do you might go too far and say or do something you later regret. Everyone’s emotions are a bit too close to the surface at the moment, so tread carefully.
gemini,You will be the center of attention this week and you will enjoy it immensely. Family, friends and even total strangers will want to get close to you and you may have to ration your appearances in public. It’s exhausting being a star!,gemini,You will be in a helpful mood over the next 24 hours and eager to do favors for those who require them. But don’t force yourself on those who have not expressly asked you to help. Some people actually prefer to suffer in silence. ,gemini,You will make an important decision today, quite possibly the single most important decision you will make for months to come. Certain people will kick up a fuss and say you have got it wrong but that will just confirm you have got it right.
gemini,Honesty is the best policy today, even if it means you hurt someone’s feelings by calling it as you see it. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind and according to the planets now is the perfect time to spell out a few home truths.
gemini,The planets warn you are expecting too much of yourself and must adjust your ambitions to a more practical level. Also, don’t get uptight if a friend or relative tells you something you don’t want to hear – they are trying to help.
gemini,If you go to extremes today it will cause more problems than it solves, especially on the work front where you would be wise not to change routines and methods you have grown used to. Believe it or not things are fine just as they are.
gemini,Someone who has let you down in the past will ask you to help them out over the next 48 hours and, not surprisingly, you will be reluctant to do so. According to the planets though you should forgive and forget. They won’t let you down again.
gemini,Friendship and luck will go together over the coming week, so make time for colleagues ad loved ones and you will benefit in ways you may not have expected. You will be at your best when you are at the center of a crowd.
gemini,It may seem as if the world is falling apart but it really isn’t that bad, and what is bad is part of a larger plan. Just because you cannot see the big picture at the moment does not mean the big picture does not exist. ,gemini,The dice are loaded in your favor at the moment – all you have to do is throw them with confidence. On the work front especially you need to take a few risks. Let people in positions of power see you are a force to be reckoned with.
gemini,Make sure your ambitions are not too outrageous because if they are you may fall short of what you expect of yourself and your confidence will suffer. You may be a go-getting Gemini but you have limits like everyone else.
gemini,Know your limits and stay within them. That is very much the message of the stars for you between now and the start of next week. No matter how far or fast you travel it’s likely that something will bring you back to earth with a bump.
gemini,Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into the career area of your chart today and that means the more you think ahead and make plans now the more success you will enjoy later in the year. Don’t limit your ambitions. Think big. ,gemini,Have you bitten off more than you can chew? Maybe, but don’t worry about it because whatever new duties or chores you have taken on the planets indicate they will get easier over the weekend – and easier still next week.
gemini,Any bad news you’ve had in recent days will be eclipsed by the good news that comes that comes to you as the new week gets under way. Your hopes and dreams will get a major boost when the Sun changes signs on Friday. Something to look forward to! ,gemini,Plan ahead and leave yourself plenty of time to reach your destination. Some days you can leave everything to the last minute and the adrenaline rush will get you through, but today you have got to be organized. Unless you enjoy getting lost. ,gemini,What you want you usually manage to get and that will certainly be the case today. The only problem is you may be so heavy-handed that even your friends get annoyed with you. Think before you speak before you act.
gemini,If your instincts tell you that what you are being asked to go along with is not a good idea then make your excuses and don’t get involved. It may make you unpopular in certain circles but better unpopular than broke financially.
gemini,Watch what you say today because if you let slip something that people in positions of authority find offensive it could damage your reputation. It may seem like a good joke to you but you know how touchy some people can be. ,gemini,Why are you making a simple situation look so difficult? According to the planets you need to ignore other people’s advice and go back to basics. Start by asking yourself how and why you have arrived at your current position. ,gemini,For every problem there is an answer and the problem you are struggling with will most likely resolve itself if you leave it alone. You may even realize that it’s not a problem at all – you have just been looking at it the wrong way. ,gemini,Now is the time to impress someone in a position of authority. Your ideas are as good as anyone else’s and better than most, so speak up and make yourself heard and it won’t be long before others are trying to impress you. ,gemini,You will find it hard to hide your emotions over the next 24 hours. Even if you keep your mouth firmly shut your body language will give you away. That’s good. It won’t do any harm to let others know you have feelings too. ,gemini,Don’t worry too much if you don’t get much done over the next 24 hours – you will more than make up for it later. Give your mind and body a rest and do what makes you feel good rather than what gets you ahead.
gemini,Something will take you by surprise today and you have only yourself to blame. The signs have been there for some time and you should have seen it coming. Still, as a Gemini you like surprises, so maybe it won’t be so bad. ,gemini,Anyone who thinks you are superficial obviously does not know you very well at all. Over the next few days you will be looking for answers to some of life’s really big questions, the kind that most people do not even know exist.
gemini,Make sure you are on the move today because the more people you meet and the more contacts you make the more opportunities will come your way in the near future. There is also a chance you could meet someone new to love.
gemini,You may have to limit your social life this weekend as unexpected events force you to take care of more serious matters. If you think you are missing out, don’t worry – you will more than make up for it next week.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, moves in your favor on Tuesday and it won’t be long before you have forgotten all about your worries and woes. Also, the more loose ends you tie up early in the week the less likely it is they will trip you up. ,gemini,The consequences of something you did weeks and maybe even months ago will catch up with you over the next few days. That might sound a bit worrying but chances are it will be quite enjoyable, and maybe profitable too. ,gemini,You seem to believe that you cannot be a success unless you take large risks – and that could be a dangerous assumption. A couple of days from now your luck will change for the better so, if you must roll the dice, wait until then.
gemini,You may be lacking in self-belief at the moment but it need not be a problem. Whatever you feel about your prospects if you just keep plugging away you WILL accomplish something worthwhile. Others think highly of you even if you do not.
gemini,You will find it easy to convince others to agree with you over the next 24 hours, not because you are forceful but because you know what words push what buttons for maximum effect. Your powers of communication are at a peak. Use them.
gemini,You just know that something special is going to happen, that it’s only a matter of time before your talents are rewarded. That may be true but what occurs over the next few days is an opportunity, nothing more – you have to make the most of it.
gemini,Today’s lunar eclipse could make you somewhat impulsive but that may be no bad thing, especially if you have been too cautious of late. But don’t go to extremes and do something that cannot possibly work – unless you believe in miracles.
gemini,No matter how often you have clashed with certain people in the past you can get on with them now. The fact is your aims are not really that different, so move on from the past and resolve to face the future together. ,gemini,Take the initiative in group and social activities over the next 24 hours. Not only will you will be immensely popular but you will also meet people who transform your outlook on life. What you dream about today you will be doing tomorrow.
gemini,Avoid getting involved in disputes that have nothing to do with you. Some of your friends may get angry that you are not prepared to stick up for them but if you take their side today every other side will be against you tomorrow.
gemini,The planets are moving in your favor now, so think positive and positive things are sure to occur. If you are in any way artistic you can create something special over the next few weeks, something of which you can be proud.
gemini,You usually get what you want in the long-term – your powers of persuasion are legendary – and you will find it easier than ever to get what you want today. Just open your mouth and ask – you’ll be amazed what others agree to.
gemini,Family matters are under excellent stars at the moment, so if you need to get back on good terms with a loved one now is the time to kiss and make up. It will also be possible to breath new life into a business relationship.
gemini,Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your birth sign this weekend, so anything to do with relationships will go well for you now. Artistic activities are also well starred, so if you have a talent of some kind now is the time to use it.
gemini,If someone tries to take liberties with your generous nature this week you must come down on them hard. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Under no circumstances take on other people’s work.
gemini,If you want to make a difference in the world then you must push your ego to one side and learn to work with other people. No matter how strong-willed a Gemini you happen to be you can’t do it all on your own. ,gemini,What happens today will plant a seed of doubt in your mind and it will rapidly reach the point where you can no longer deny that something is wrong. That’s good: once you know what’s wrong you can take steps to fix it.
gemini,Venus in your sign makes this a good time for affairs of the heart and anything of an artistic or creative nature, but Saturn is also strong at the moment, which means you must not lose your grip on reality. Common sense is king.
gemini,Someone you meet while on the move will be fun but are they trustworthy? The planets warn that you must not let your guard down because if you give away a secret about yourself today it won’t be long before everyone knows about it.
gemini,Spend quality time with your closest friends today, because something you hear while laughing and lunching together could have a major impact on your life over the next few months, or years, or decades – yes, it really could be that big.
gemini,Others will be free with their advice today, and that’s nice of them, but you will ignore each and every word of it. As far as you are concerned if there is advice to be given you are the one who should be giving it! ,gemini,You are in one of your romantic moods at the moment and the next few days could be special for affairs of the heart. But you also have some thinking to do, so set aside an hour or two where you can be alone with your ideas.
gemini,Work will be the dominant theme later in the week, so make the most of your freedom to come and go as you please now. As a Gemini you like to get out and about and meet new people – so what are you waiting for?,gemini,Mercury, your ruler, links nicely with both Mars and Pluto today, so chances are you will be assertive in the extreme. Just be careful you don’t create confrontations where none need to exist. People are not the enemy – well, most of the time.
gemini,This is a time for reflection, a time for looking back over the previous 12 months or so and learning what you can from both your successes and your failures. Most likely the former outweigh the latter by at least three to one, so cheer up.
gemini,It might be a smart idea to adopt a low profile today. The planets warn there are some angry people out there in the big, bad world, so keep your head down and don’t call attention to yourself. Arguments are the last thing you need. ,gemini,Don’t try to ram your ideas and opinions down other people’s throats – it will be hugely counter-productive. Others are entitled to see things differently than you, so accept that your outlooks clash. It should be easy enough to live and let live. ,gemini,Avoid petty arguments, because the more you get involved in minor disputes the less time and energy you will have for dealing with the truly important stuff. Also, avoid worrying about events over which you have no control. There’s no percentage in it. ,gemini,You will clash with someone whose opinions you don’t much like today, but if you stay calm and think logically you may discover that what they are saying has an element of truth in it. Never be afraid to admit you were wrong.
gemini,You may be tempted to bend the rules a bit today but the planets warn you won’t gain much if you do. Not only that but later in the week your conscience will nag at you. Play by the book – you will still be a winner.
gemini,You may not be happy with some of the changes taking place at the moment but your instincts tell you that you will benefit from them in some way, so keep your doubts to yourself and don’t make waves – you don’t want to sink!,gemini,Your ruler Mercury moves into your sign tomorrow and within a matter of hours you will feel the difference in a number of ways. Put the past behind you once and for all and focus only on the bright days to come, of which there will be many.
gemini,It is time to seize the initiative, declare your independence and start something new. With Mercury, your ruler, moving into your own sign today you can be sure that whatever you begin will be stamped with the mark of success.
gemini,If you are honest about what it is you are hoping to achieve this weekend then others will be honest with you about whether or not they can help. The worst thing you can do now is to keep your plans to yourself. ,gemini,Your ideas may seem outrageous to those who do not share your vision but if they make sense to you then nothing else matters. No idea should be considered taboo over the coming week – the fact is you have the power to make it work. ,gemini,If a friend asks you to do something you disagree with today you must have the strength to refuse their request. Even if it puts a strain on your relationship in the short-term in the long-term they will admit it was the right thing to do. ,gemini,Under no circumstances agree to do someone else’s work for them today. Yes, of course, you would most likely make a better job of it but that’s not the point. They should be doing things for you, not the other way round.
gemini,Travel and social plans will go well today and if you can find a way to combine the two they will go even better. News from afar is likely too, perhaps from someone you last saw on less than friendly terms. Time to make up. ,gemini,Whatever else you do today do not put money before love. If you want to impress someone who means a lot to you then do whatever it takes and don’t worry how much it may cost. Whatever the price it will be worth it.
gemini,It might be a good idea to take it easy for the next few days, or what passes for easy in the Gemini universe. When Mars moves into your sign early next week there will be no holding you back, so get plenty of rest now.
gemini,Lady Luck will smile on you this weekend but you must not allow that to mislead you into thinking that you can do what you like and get away with it. Just because one good thing happens does not mean you can take silly risks. ,gemini,One of the best times of the year for you begins on Tuesday when Mars moves into your sign. You will be a lot more active and a lot more ambitious, but more importantly you will put your own needs first for a change. ,gemini,You don’t like to be suspicious but if someone offers you something for nothing today it will pay you to find out if they are up to something. Chances are the offer is on the level but you can never be too careful. ,gemini,You may not be in the mood for compromise today but you should make the effort anyway. Even with Mars now moving into your sign there will be some things that you can only do hand-in-hand with others. Don’t be too individualistic.
gemini,The planets warn you could easily go over the top and offend or annoy someone you really need to stay on good terms with. Don’t let that stop you taking risks but make sure others don’t end up paying for your mistakes.
gemini,You are coming to the end of one of the toughest times of the year and when the Sun moves into your sign a week from now your confidence will come flooding back. Between now and then you are advised to take it easy. Don’t exert yourself.
gemini,Wherever you go and whatever you do Lady Luck will smile on you today. But don’t use that as an excuse to go places or do things that put you at some sort of risk. You may be lucky but you are not invincible.
gemini,Things could get a bit tense and a bit frustrating this weekend and you certainly won’t be happy with the restrictions other people place on you. Be that as it may you should take the path of least resistance. It’s not worth fighting about. ,gemini,Any day is a good day to help someone in need but if you show your generous side this week you are sure to get something in return in the near future. And don’t think you won’t need it: you know how quickly luck can change. ,gemini,There is something you must deal with today that you would like to pretend does not exist. But it does exist and you have no choice in the matter, so get on with it and get it done. Loved ones will thank you for it later on. ,gemini,Mars in your sign gives you a huge sense of optimism and self-belief but it does not mean you will be free of the consequences of your actions. Think before you act over the next 24 hours – it could save you a lot of trouble.
gemini,The Sun moves into your birth sign tomorrow and if you are smart you will spend the next 12 to 24 hours tying up loose ends. After that it’s all systems go, and you will be going places and doing things you never thought possible.
gemini,A new solar year begins for you today and you must start it in the right frame of mind. All the bad things that happened in recent months are no longer of any concern. Only the good things that are going to happen matter now.
gemini,Chances are you will splash out on something that catches your eye today, only to regret it over the weekend when you realize how much it has cost and how little you now have available for other activities. Return it and get a refund.
gemini,You will find yourself caught between extremes over the next 48 hours, unable to decide which direction to move in next. But who says you have to move anywhere? Why not stay where you are and let the world come to you? ,gemini,Nothing is too much for you now. No effort is too great. Just make sure that you benefit personally from all the hard work you put in. Your generosity may be inspiring but it could inspire some people to profit at your expense.
gemini,You may feel as if you have lost your way a bit of late but there is no need to change direction. From Wednesday onwards things will start to look a bit clearer, although it is still your responsibility to keep your eyes open. ,gemini,Get routine matters out of the way as early as you can because later in the day you will get an invite of some sort that you won’t want to turn down. Take your responsibilities seriously, but not so seriously that you cannot enjoy yourself. ,gemini,Will you be a heroic failure or a huge success? That depends on how soon you go after the target that is in your sights. Hold off until the weekend if you can because that’s when the universe will be more on your side.
gemini,Don’t waste time worrying about something that is about as likely to happen as the Sun rising in the west. The planets warn you are wasting time and energy fretting over matters of minor importance. Look at, and learn from, the bigger picture.
gemini,You will get some good news today, the kind of news that makes you want to dance and sing. Actually, the news itself may be nothing special but it will confirm that your recent worries were entirely groundless – as, deep down, you always knew.
gemini,Honesty is essential over the next 48 hours, especially when dealing with people in positions of authority. No matter how intricate the tales you weave they will see through your scheming with ease. Lies and exaggerations will not be appreciated. ,gemini,This is not a good time to make a decision about a relationship. Even if you are absolutely certain what the right course of action is it will still pay you to hold off a few days and see how things develop. You may be surprised. ,gemini,Get the week off to a good start by refusing to worry about a relationship issue. Tomorrow’s full moon is sure to resolve the situation, after which you can move on, either alone or together. It’s probably not as bad as it seems. ,gemini,If you find yourself backed into a corner today you will have to talk your way out of trouble. This is one of those occasions when, if you sound sincere, even your rivals and enemies will find it hard to criticize you.
gemini,If you recently made some kind of error then hold up your hand and admit it. No one will think less of you because of it and punishment is unlikely to be severe. Swallow your pride and accept your share of the blame.
gemini,If you push yourself hard now you will accomplish more in the next 24 hours than most people manage in 24 days. You won’t lack for energy and you won’t lack for passion – and if you use your brains you won’t lack for anything. ,gemini,If you have found it difficult to get your message across of late then it should be easier today and over the weekend. Travel and social activities are also under good stars now, so get out and about and make sure you get seen.
gemini,You may fall out with someone you usually get along with quite well over the next 48 hours. If you are sensible and don’t take what they say too seriously chances are you will be friends again come the start of the new week. ,gemini,The more you try to change people the more they stay the same. The sooner you accept that fact the better and once you have done so you will have a lot less trouble with those who seem to delight in taking an opposing view.
gemini,Be careful what you say as the new week begins because with Jupiter, planet of excess, moving through the communications area of your chart you could easily go too far. Never forget that words can hurt as well as heal. ,gemini,Anyone who thinks you are too set in your ways will be required to think again as you make strenuous efforts to bring your life up to date. But don’t follow the latest fad or fashion for the sake of it. Be progressive, not slavish.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, turns direct tomorrow, so if there is something you need to say you should wait to say it until after then when the words will come more easily and others will be more prepared to listen.
gemini,This is a good time for social activities of one kind or another, so why not throw a party and invite all your friends. You may even get the chance to get back on good terms with someone you fell out with earlier in the year.
gemini,You are perfectly within your rights to refuse a request from a friend or employer or work colleague. According to the planets you need to avoid anything that might be too physically or mentally demanding over the next 24 hours.
gemini,You will get the chance to make your mark this weekend but that does not mean you have to rush into anything. An offer that comes your way may seem too good to turn down but there could be an even better offer coming along behind it.
gemini,There have been so many changes of late that you probably need to catch your breath and the good news is you will get a period of stability to offset the chaos of the past few weeks. Give your mind and body time to heal.
gemini,Make sure your time is your own today because if you have to do things for other people you won’t be happy and you won’t be productive. If you feel the need, slip away for a bit and don’t tell anyone where you are going.
gemini,A new moon in your sign is a wonderful omen that, among other things, gives you huge self-belief. You know it is not a case of IF you will succeed but WHEN you will succeed, and with that kind of confidence it won’t be long.
gemini,If you did not do something remarkable yesterday you will certainly do something remarkable today. Even if you are one of life’s rare shy and retiring Geminis you will find ways to show the world what you can do — almost anything you please!,gemini,Recent cosmic activity has tested you to the limit and because you have been on the go from morning to night you may now be exhausted. If so, take the next few days off. The universe can go on without you for a bit.
gemini,Because the Sun leaves your birth sign this weekend it is unlikely you will be able to finish a number of things you started in haste. It is though still possible to complete one really important task. You know what it is, so get on with it.
gemini,You need to start thinking seriously about your cashflow situation. The Sun’s entry into the money area of your chart tomorrow means you can and you must face up to financial reality – and that means earning more and spending less.
gemini,You have a choice this week: you can stay at home and worry about what has gone wrong, or you can go out and have fun with your friends. Laughter really is the best medicine, so seek out people who bring a smile to your face.
gemini,Are your money problems real or imagined? According to the planets you are worrying for no good reason, so don’t do something drastic today just to give your cashflow a boost – chances are it does not need it. ,gemini,Try not to be too over-confident today. The planets, and your ruler Mercury in particular, warn you could be in serious trouble if you gamble unwisely, especially if other people’s money as well as your own is at stake!,gemini,Others may say you are aiming too high but the planets indicate that if you move confidently in the direction of your dreams they will come true – and maybe quicker than you imagined. All things are possible, at least for you. ,gemini,Mercury in your sign makes this an ideal time for forward planning, for thinking ahead. What you decide over the next few days will be what you bring into being over the next three or four weeks, so think carefully. Is it what you really want?,gemini,Don’t waste time trying to work out what went wrong with a relationship. It isn’t worth the effort. It is more than possible that a new love will soon be crossing your path – but you may not notice if you are still lamenting what might have been.
gemini,Try not to exaggerate the negative aspects of your cash flow situation over the next few days. It could lead to all sorts of problems if you start making crisis decisions where, in fact, no crisis exists. Don’t worry, you will find ways to make ends meet.
gemini,You have so many plans, but will they ever amount to anything? At some stage this week you will have to admit that some of your ideas are too outrageous to be taken seriously. But others will work and it is those you must focus on. ,gemini,You will be quite vocal in your condemnation of someone’s activities over the next 24 hours, but before you go accusing them of immoral behavior remember there are a few skeletons in your own closet you might like to keep hidden! ,gemini,You will allow your heart to rule your head today. You don’t care about facts and figures, you care only about having a good time with the people you love. Your attitude to life in general will be much more relaxed.
gemini,Someone has taken advantage of you once too often and you need to make sure they don’t take advantage of you in the future. Deep down you know if you don’t get tough with them now they will let you down again and again.
gemini,You have started at least one and maybe several new projects in recent weeks – now all you have to do is keep them going. Watch out for rivals who would like nothing better than to see your efforts fail. Be vigilant.
gemini,This is going to be a busy week and the less you try to do the more work will land in your lap. At some stage, for the sake of your health, you will have to call a halt. Not even a livewire Gemini can do it all.
gemini,Try not to take anything too seriously today. With so many changes taking place in your world you need to make a conscious effort to stay calm and be flexible in your approach to life’s little problems – and, yes, they are only little. ,gemini,You have done a lot of thinking in recent weeks and now it is time to put what you discovered, about yourself and about the wider world, to good use. Big ideas are all very well but it’s what you do with them that counts.
gemini,You may be under the impression that you can say and do what you please but don’t be so sure. You may be under divine protection but that does not mean you can step out of line and be protected from the consequences every time.
gemini,You must take care of duties and responsibilities that should have been taken care of a long time ago. You have put them off long enough – now it is time to knuckle down and get ahead of the game for a change.
gemini,Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart will help you find ways to ease your cash flow problems. It will also open your eyes to the fact that you have been letting certain people take advantage of you, financially and otherwise, for too long.
gemini,You won’t care what you say or do this week so long as it has the desired effect. When discussing serious issues with family and friends you will deliberately take an opposing view just to get the argument going. You enjoy stirring things up. ,gemini,Try not to worry about money matters today because there is nothing you can do to change things one way or the other. Instead, use your imagination to visualize being rich and secure. What you imagine today will be your reality tomorrow.
gemini,If you need to persuade someone to give you something today you may be successful but they may feel resentful that you put them on the spot. If possible, wait until the moon is new on Thursday, then they will happily hand it to you.
gemini,You are in an adventurous mood and have no intention of sitting around in the same old places, with the same old people and doing the same old things. You crave excitement and you are sure to get it before the end of the week. ,gemini,The new moon indicates that if someone makes you an offer of a financial nature it is most likely on the level and should be seriously considered. You won’t be happy if you dilly-dally and a rival beats you to it. Act now.
gemini,You will find it exceedingly easy to guess what people are planning over the next 24 hours – their body language makes it so obvious. Add to that the promptings of your inner voice and you can’t go wrong – unless you want to, that is. ,gemini,You need to slow down a bit and pay more attention to what is taking place on the home front. Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart bodes well for family relationships, so make it a priority to heel rifts with loved ones. ,gemini,Money matters should worry you less when the Sun and Mercury, your ruler, change signs in midweek. If you get the urge to travel over the next few days by all means go for it. Even a journey of just a few miles could lead to something special. ,gemini,Try not to take life so seriously this week. Over the next few days you will look back and realize just how silly it was to get annoyed about things which, in the greater scheme of things, are of no real importance at all. ,gemini,If you are going to criticize someone today make sure you stick to the facts, because if you exaggerate your complaints they will, quite rightly, complain that you are getting personal for no good reason. It might be best to say nothing at all. ,gemini,If you must take risks at least make them risks that won’t cost you an arm and a leg if they go wrong. The planets warn it might be wiser to keep your money in your pocket than to gamble it on things you don’t know much about.
gemini,You will find it difficult to keep your nose out of other people’s business today. The Sun’s change of signs brings to the fore the inquisitive side of your nature – you want to know everything about everyone, and you want to know it now! ,gemini,You are about to be offered something that will do you a lot of good but for some strange reason you may be reluctant to accept. Have no fear. With the Sun and Mercury on your side this weekend you are under cosmic protection. ,gemini,You are about to be offered something that will do you a lot of good but for some strange reason you may be reluctant to accept. Have no fear. With the Sun and Mercury on your side this weekend you are under cosmic protection. ,gemini,You will find it difficult to get along with certain people this week, especially people on the work front whose attitude annoys you. Of course, you don’t have to like colleagues to work with them, but it helps. Find ways to reduce the tension. ,gemini,Today’s Mercury-Neptune link means you must watch what you say. Not everyone is as good at taking criticism as you are at dishing it out, and if you upset the wrong person you could make an enemy – maybe for life!,gemini,Friends and loved ones will go out of their way to assist you today, so don’t just sit there pretending that everything is fine. No matter how independent-minded a Gemini you might be you still need a helping hand now and again.
gemini,The same old answers from the same old people no longer satisfy you – something deeper is going on and you are determined to find out what it is. Be careful. Having found it you may realize that ignorance is sometimes a blessing. ,gemini,The best way to get over your current negative mood is to throw yourself into an activity that you really enjoy. It does not have to be anything important, just something that takes your mind off your worries, such as they are.
gemini,Both at home and at work you will act in ways that are completely out of character today, but no harm will come of it so long as you keep telling yourself that it’s all a game. Take nothing too seriously and nothing too serious will happen.
gemini,You need to remind yourself that what is right for you may not be right for someone else – and that what is right for them may be wrong for you. You may not approve of somebody’s actions but it is not your place to judge.
gemini,Keep your plans to yourself during the early part of the week, especially if they are the sort of plans that your rivals would like to disrupt. If you let slip your intentions those who wish you ill will find ways to make things tough for you.
gemini,Don’t worry if certain things have not been running smoothly of late because what happens over the next few days will not only bring problems to a head but also provide the means for you to solve them. All experience is good experience. ,gemini,Don’t worry if you have been unable to get through to those you love of late because today’s Venus-Jupiter union will make words redundant. They will see by the look in your eyes that your feelings for them have grown, not diminished.
gemini,You have given a lot in recent weeks and you will be expected to give even more today. But that’s okay. Where affairs of the heart are concerned there is no limit to your generosity and, somehow, the more you give the more you get.
gemini,There is no point trying to control each and every situation you find yourself in – you will wear yourself out if you try. Some things are simply too big for even a Gemini to change and the sooner you accept that the happier you will be.
gemini,Something in your life is coming to an end and must be helped on its way. If you try to hold on to it any longer it will be snatched from your grasp by forces much greater than you know how to deal with. Bow to the inevitable.
gemini,Whatever it is you are worrying about you need to get over it because it is a complete and utter waste of your time. With Mars, planet of action, changing signs today you will soon get the chance to do something positive about your problems.
gemini,You will be much in demand socially this week but you will also have to deal with a family issue of some kind, so don’t make promises you may not be able to keep. Loved ones may need sympathy but more than that they need practical advice. ,gemini,It may not be easy turning down an attractive, and profitable, proposal but turn it down you must because the planets warn it will result in more work and more pressure than you can handle. Always put your own wellbeing first.
gemini,Even if you expect the unexpected over the next two or three days there will still be something that catches you out. The good news is it will be something you like, something that adds to, rather than detracts from, your enjoyment of life.
gemini,Some sort of domestic strife is likely today but, at the same time, you are feeling extremely good-natured, so it should be easy enough to deal with. The only reason you disagree about something is because you are approaching it from different angles. ,gemini,Focus your attention on one specific thing today and ignore all the other interesting things that may be taking place around you. It may not be easy but it must be done if you want to get an important task finished before the weekend.
gemini,Today’s new moon will make it easy for you to get your point of view across. However, with major planets moving retrograde at the moment you would be wise to spell things out as simply as possible. Not everyone sees as clearly as you.
gemini,If the places and faces you see every day no longer inspire you then it must be time for a move. Cosmic activity in the most open area of your chart makes you eager for new experiences. This is the ideal time to travel, so pack your bag.
gemini,Make the most of your freedom over the next few days because a week or so from now it will be much harder to come and go as you please, especially on the home front where loved ones’ needs will have to come before your own. ,gemini,Some rather intense cosmic activity will encourage you to deal with the kind of events you usually go out of your way to avoid. Chances are you will deal with them so well that later on you will wonder what all the fuss was about.
gemini,No matter how many great ideas you have in your head what is the point unless you actually do something with them? The planets are now encouraging you to do something special, something that gets you noticed by all the right people.
gemini,Something delightful will happen today. Most likely someone you are close to, a friend or relative or neighbor, will do something unexpected and for no better reason than to make you feel good. There are still some really nice people in the world.
gemini,No matter how much you want to help other people you will help them more if you help yourself first. What good will you be to others if you are constantly worrying about paying the bills and making ends meet? Financial security must come first. ,gemini,You may be tempted to start again at something that is not going as well as you expected but if you do it may never get finished. This is one of those occasions when your best course of action is to plod on and hope for the best.
gemini,After several weeks in which you have been free to come and go as you please you will now have to stay close to home and pay more attention to the needs of partners and loved ones. But why should that be such a hardship?,gemini,It may be wise not to start anything new over the next few days. Chances are something will happen this week that leads to a major change in your ambitions. You may even reject everything that has gone before and head in a new direction.
gemini,You may be having second thoughts about the direction your life is taking but this is not the time to make major changes. Stay on the path you have chosen and don’t give up just because certain things do not make sense. They will, eventually. ,gemini,At some stage today you will start to wonder if maybe the powers that be have got it in for you, but common sense should tell you it is your state of mind that is making things seem tougher than they really are. Life will get easier very soon.
gemini,If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, even if certain people don’t want you to have it. Today’s events will also remind you that some of the best things in life don’t have to be worked too hard for. ,gemini,Some things are possible and some things are not and if you don’t know the difference then what happens today will leave you in no doubt at all. Don’t condemn yourself if you make a mistake: at least you tried something different. ,gemini,Don’t be fooled by someone who wants you to believe that your paths have crossed purely by chance. Be friendly by all means but don’t be taken in by any offers they might make – almost certainly they are designed to make them rich and you poor.
gemini,A full moon in the most ambitious area of your chart means you are sure to get excited about something this weekend, but be careful you don’t get carried away because if you lose your sense of perspective you could lose important friends too.
gemini,You will find it easy enough to make someone look silly but you should think twice before doing so because the results could be as bad for you as they are for them. The best way to deal with annoying people is to ignore them. ,gemini,There will be major changes over the coming week and they will be the kind of changes you can do little about. The good news is that tomorrow’s Venus-Mars union indicates that more enjoyable times are on their way, so hang in there. ,gemini,By all means go out and take on the world today but be warned: with so many planets moving retrograde at the moment the gains you make now could be taken away from you later, so don’t get carried away by your own brilliance.
gemini,Sometimes it can be difficult to know whether to laugh or to cry and what happens today will certainly leave you with mixed emotions. If you feel depressed, look up a friend you have not seen in a while. They’ll make you smile.
gemini,Are your plans realistic? If they are you will make great progress over the next few days. If not, you will be forced to think again about what you are doing. You may achieve more in the long-term if you make changes now.
gemini,Something dramatic is likely to happen today and the chances are it will either happen to you directly or happen to others in such a way that it affects you as well. No harm will come of it so long as you keep your wits about you.
gemini,Whatever you have been planning in secret now is the time to let everyone know about it. The planets indicate that what you are working on will be a success, but how big a success could depend on how willing you are to take risks.
gemini,You will hear a lot of gossip this week, and most of it will be enjoyable, but if you hear something that rings untrue almost certainly it means that someone is trying to mislead you. Don’t take anything you see or hear too seriously. ,gemini,You may be tempted to use force to get your way, both at home and at work, but that would be a mistake. Others will respond better if you coax them rather than coerce them. Make sure there is something in it for everyone.
gemini,You won’t hesitate to speak your mind today and not everyone will like it. Your words will be short, sharp and to the point, and you won’t care a bit if others get upset. Just make sure that what you say is backed up by facts. ,gemini,Mercury, your ruler, is on fine form at the moment and you certainly don’t lack for confidence. Social occasions and travel plans are especially well starred, so don’t sit there doing nothing, get out into the world and enjoy yourself. ,gemini,It will pay you to go along with what other people want to do today. The more you bow to their wishes now the more likely it is they will support you later on when you want to go off by yourself and do your own thing.
gemini,You must be decisive today, especially on the home front where loved ones will be expecting you to give some kind of lead. What you must always remember is that despite your occasional minor differences you are part of the same team. ,gemini,Try not to keep your feelings bottled up inside. This weekend’s solar eclipse urges you to express yourself as forcefully as possible. If there is something important you need to say, now is the time to let it all out – the louder the better!,gemini,A relationship will either be repaired or destroyed this week – it could go either way. If it is time to say goodbye, do so in the right spirit and move on without regret to whatever comes next in your life. The future is always better than the past.
gemini,You may have to devote the daylight hours to work-related matters but once the Sun goes down your thoughts will be on having fun. As far as romance is concerned a secret crush you have is unlikely to stay secret much longer.
gemini,If you have a favor to ask of a friend or family member, now is the time. The planets indicate that for reasons which may not be entirely clear everyone wants to help you today. You would be foolish not to take advantage of it. ,gemini,Not everything will go the way you want it to go today but those things which do work out right will far outnumber those things which don’t. A domestic or romantic dispute can now easily be resolved – IF you are willing to say sorry first.
gemini,Your priority now must be to get out into the world and do what Geminis do best – have fun. Career and money worries can be left until another day, or another week, or another month. Okay, go the whole hog – leave them for another year!,gemini,You enjoy the limelight and you will certainly get the chance to put on a show over the next 48 hours. It’s good that you like being the center of attention because it will happen often over the next four or five weeks. ,gemini,If you feel restless and ill at ease don’t worry – you will get the chance to ring the changes when the Sun moves in your favor this coming Tuesday. What you have to leave behind will be eclipsed by what awaits you in a new environment. ,gemini,No one has the right to interfere in your affairs but certain people will continue to do so unless and until you tell them to mind their own business. If you do that right now you will be free to come and go as you please.
gemini,There is a danger today that you will overreact to criticism and retreat into your shell. That would be a shame because there are so many possibilities and opportunities available to you now. You don’t have to be so precious. Toughen up.
gemini,You will be eager to change things for the better over the next few days and that’s good because the planets indicate that whatever you start now will result in major gains for you over the coming six months. Lady Luck is on your side. ,gemini,Take advantage of the good things that life has to offer and don’t doubt for a moment that you deserve each and every one of them. You have done so much to make life good for others, now let them do something for you.
gemini,The Sun in Libra does wonders for your confidence but you must not take too much for granted because other aspects warn you could easily overextend yourself. You have what it takes to win big but first you need to be aware of your shortcomings.
gemini,Things will change so fast over the next few days that your head will spin. The one and only thing you need to remember is that ultimately things always happen for a good reason. That may not be obvious to begin with but give it time. ,gemini,Disagreements with people you usually get along with quite well are likely over the next two or three days but don’t be alarmed as it is really no big deal. However, if you do say something hurtful it might be wise to unsay it again as quickly as possible.
gemini,Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Libra may be boosting your confidence but there are still some things that won’t come easy. Don’t take anything for granted because the moment you do is the moment when things start going wrong.
gemini,Jupiter in the domestic sector of your chart is good for family relationships, so make it your priority over the next few days to heel rifts with loved ones and relatives. Don’t wait for them to make the first move – make it yourself.
gemini,If you have got complicated plans on the go then it might be wise to postpone them for a day or two. Mercury’s link to the Sun today suggests either that something is missing or that you have not thought things through enough. ,gemini,You are taking something or someone too seriously and what occurs over the next 24 hours will help you see things in perspective. It will also remind you that life is too short to waste time on matters that won’t mean a thing a month from now.
gemini,You will get every opportunity to show that you have what it takes today and over the weekend. You need to remember though that being the boss is not just about giving orders – it is also about making others understand and respect you.
gemini,This is one of the most dynamic and creative times of the year, so whatever you find yourself working on over the next few days the chances are it will be a resounding success. It might even bring you fame and fortune.
gemini,The past is over and done with, so let it go and move on. If you can do that this week you will discover a peace of mind that has been lacking of late. Above all remember that yesterday’s mistakes are the building blocks of today’s successes.
gemini,You can be easygoing to a fault but you cannot expect others to be as accepting of the current situation as you are. Whatever friends and colleagues say or do over the next 24 hours don’t let it spoil your buoyant mood. ,gemini,There is no point worrying too much about money matters today because there is nothing you can do about them one way or the other. Instead, visualize what your perfect situation would be. What you imagine today will be your reality tomorrow. ,gemini,A friend may not have been very supportive of late but that does not mean they are turning against you. It’s more likely they have worries of their own to contend with and have had less time to devote to you. They will make it up to you. ,gemini,There will be times today when you feel out of touch with what is going on around you. Everyone else seems to be tuned in to events that mean nothing to you. Don’t worry, you are not missing much. Others envy you for being so independent. ,gemini,What you have to do and what you want to do are two different things but that’s too bad. The good news is that with communications planet Mercury moving in your favor again your powers of persuasion will soon be back to help you out.
gemini,You have sensed for quite some time that something in your family or financial world is not working as it should and needs to be changed. Now, with Jupiter and Pluto on your side you can take the necessary steps to make things right. ,gemini,Forget about what happened yesterday or last week or last year. The only thing that matters now is what you are going to do next. And with Tuesday’s new moon very much on your side the simple fact is you can do as you please. ,gemini,You have done a lot of thinking in recent weeks and now it is time to put into effect what you have discovered both about yourself and about the world you inhabit. Your confidence is high at the moment, so change should come easy to you.
gemini,You will one day be glad that you were forced to make certain changes, and if you stop struggling and work with them today you will not only benefit financially and professionally but you will enjoy yourself too. What’s not to like? ,gemini,You have carried a lot of responsibility on your shoulders of late but over the next two or three days you need to find ways to lessen the load. A burden shared is a burden halved, so get loved ones to help you. ,gemini,Focus on career and work-related matters today. If you knuckle down and get things done you will make the kind of impression that earns big rewards. Employers and other powerful people are eager to see you succeed, so don’t let them down.
gemini,You might like to change the world for the better but all you can really do is change yourself for the better. Act only from the highest of principles today. Not only will you feel good about yourself but you will be an example to others too.
gemini,Chaos is likely to reign this weekend but if you stay calm and don’t overreact there is not much that events can do to actually harm you. You must though expect partners and loved ones to be rather touchy. Maybe you should disappear for a while! ,gemini,You have pushed the boundaries both physically and emotionally in recent weeks, but you cannot keep pushing them forever. Your time is precious and so is your energy and your task for the coming week is to find ways to conserve them both. ,gemini,You expect nothing less than perfection, of yourself and of other people, but the planets are now urging you to be less demanding. You don’t have to push yourself to your limits and beyond. Others would like you to be more laidback too!,gemini,If you find yourself in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable then get up and leave. Don’t worry that it might be interpreted as being rude: the only thing that matters is your own peace of mind, so don’t suffer in silence.
gemini,Let your thoughts roam where they will over the next 24 hours. There are no limits to what you can imagine and there are no limits to what you can achieve. If others think that your ideas are bizarre, agree with them and change nothing. ,gemini,Work and health matters will take on extra importance as from tomorrow, so now would be a good time to think more deeply about what you are doing and what sort of effect it is having on your physical, mental and emotional well-being. ,gemini,There will be times today and over the weekend when it feels as if your get-up-and-go has got up and gone. Maybe it’s because you are trying to do too many things for too many people. It’s time to put your own wellbeing first. ,gemini,You won’t find it easy to keep your feelings under control this weekend and nor should you want to. Next week you will look back and wonder what got into you but you will also have to admit that it was a lot of fun! ,gemini,Even a Gemini has doubts occasionally and because this week’s full moon takes place in the most sensitive area of your chart you must expect to be less confident than usual. The good news is that by Thursday at the latest the gloom will be gone.
gemini,Do not allow yourself to get discouraged just because there is still a yawning gap between your dreams and your reality. Throw yourself into an activity that you really enjoy. If nothing else it will take your mind off your worries, such as they are. ,gemini,Be careful you don’t get carried away with too many big ideas today. And don’t get so caught up in the grandeur of the bigger picture that you miss small but important details. Those details are going to matter, especially where work is concerned. ,gemini,Have you bitten off more than you can chew? It certainly looks like it. At some point today you will have to admit that you have been aiming too high. No matter, it’s not the end of the world. Even Geminis get it wrong sometimes. ,gemini,If a relationship of a practical nature is to be a success you are going to have to give ground on certain things. No matter how independent-minded a Gemini you may be you must make an effort to meet others halfway today.
gemini,No matter what you have done wrong you won’t be punished for it – provided you hold up your hand and admit your mistake. According to the planets your latest transgression is too big to ignore but still small enough to be forgiven.
gemini,Ignore any tales of woe you might hear over the next 48 hours because they are designed to trap you. You may want to help those in need but, sadly, there are people in this world who will happily take advantage of your kindly nature. ,gemini,It might pay you to bend the truth a little over the next few days, especially if there is money at stake. You don’t have to lie exactly but try to direct other people’s attention to what you want them to see. Help them get the message. ,gemini,You may disagree with what certain people say or do over the next 24 hours but don’t get worked up about it. Chances are they are hoping you will get angry so they can use it as an excuse to move against you.
gemini,Keep lines of communication open over the next 24 hours because you are going to need them. You don’t have to pretend that you like certain people but you do have to work with them and that means you have to talk to them too – sometimes.
gemini,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means it will be difficult, maybe impossible, to get through to loved ones over the next 24 hours, so don’t waste your time trying. They will come around when they are ready.
gemini,There is no point trying to keep something secret from those who know you best because they can read you like a book. No matter how embarrassing it might be you must own up to what you have done. Chances are they won’t even care.
gemini,Don’t keep your hopes and dreams to yourself – let everyone know what it is you desire. The more people understand what it is you are hoping to achieve the more likely it is you will get assistance from them when you need it.
gemini,Try not to call attention to yourself this weekend, especially on the work front where you could find yourself taking on extra tasks and responsibilities. Get on with what you are doing quietly and calmly, and hopefully you won’t be singled out. ,gemini,There is a danger that you will become so sensitive to other people’s feelings over the coming week that you will put their needs ahead of your own. You must always look out for number one. A little bit of selfishness is not a bad thing.
gemini,You would be wise to limit the number of things you work on as the new week begins. You may be eager to make an impression but don’t let your enthusiasm get the better of you. There’s no rush – you still have plenty of time.
gemini,You may be tempted to play things by ear today but the planets warn you are likely to regret it. You will do best if you have a specific aim in mind and a workable plan that will get you from A to B by the shortest route.
gemini,Even if you feel on top of the world physically it will pay you to slow down a bit today – and take better care of your health. Everyone has limits, even Geminis, and the planets warn you are getting dangerously close to your own. ,gemini,Those feelings of self-doubt that have been holding you back are sure to be swept away today, tomorrow and over the weekend. Mars in Libra promises great things if you can overcome your fear of losing. You are and always will be a winner.
gemini,You have been a little too cautious of late – which is not like you at all – but as from today you will go to the other extreme and take risks left, right and center. Whether or not you are right to do so remains to be seen.
gemini,There are times when you can do as you please and get away with it but the planets warn this isn’t one of them. If you cut corners or take liberties this weekend someone who is bigger and stronger is sure to cut you down to size. ,gemini,Something is bothering you and you need to decide what you are going to do about it. If you clear your head of angry thoughts and see the situation for what it is rather than what you fear it might be the answer will come soon enough.
gemini,Just because something has always been done a certain way does not mean that you have to do it that way every time. Just because something is trendy or fashionable does not mean it is right. Go your own way and do your own thing. ,gemini,It may feel as if you are running out of time but it isn’t true. What you need to understand is that time never runs out – there will always be another chance, and another after that, a bit further down the road. Don’t put yourself under so much pressure. ,gemini,The more others say bad things about you today the more certain you can be that your own actions are having the desired effect. If you encounter opposition – and you will – you must not back down. Let others know that you will not be cowed into silence.
gemini,It may seem as if you do not deserve the good things coming your way but it isn’t true. Yes, luck may be a factor but it all evens out in the end. That’s why certain people are upset: deep down they know you are better than they are. ,gemini,By all means work hard but once you have reached the targets you have set yourself you must reward yourself with plenty of rest and relaxation. Also, don’t be too eager to confide your fears to people you don’t know for certain that you can trust.
gemini,Do you act on what your mind tells you or do you act on what your emotions tell you? Hopefully it is the former as the only way out of your current dilemma is to realize that you must cut your losses and start again from scratch.
gemini,Be more open about your feelings this week. Let those who care about you know that you care about them too. Sometimes you can be so secretive that you make it hard even for loved ones to know what is going on in your heart or your head.
gemini,This is generally a positive time for you but you still need to be cautious in certain areas. Be especially wary of people who flatter you because they are obviously looking to help themselves in some way – at your expense, of course.
gemini,This is a good time for relationships, especially those that come from the heart. Don’t hold back today: give everything you have got – and you will get it all back and more in the days, weeks and months to follow. Love always multiplies. ,gemini,It may seem as if the whole world is against you but common sense should tell you that isn’t true. Try not to fall into the trap of thinking that those who disagree with you are enemies. They could in fact be the best friends you have. ,gemini,There are a lot of changes in your world at the moment and some of them are a bit worrying. But no matter how great the upheavals may get you have nothing to fear. If you face up to life’s challenges you will come through unscathed.
gemini,It does not matter what feuds you had with certain people in the past, the only thing that matters now is that you work together on something that you both believe in. You can do a lot of good if you join forces with like-minded people. ,gemini,Gemini is an Air sign and sociable by nature but sometimes you need to spend time by yourself, if only to get your thoughts together. You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party every weekend, so take some time out if you require it. ,gemini,If you want to get ahead you may have to take a few risks. Fortunately, most of them will pay off and the one or two that go wrong won’t do you any great harm. Don’t let fear of failure hold you back. Who dares wins!,gemini,Don’t push yourself harder than you need to. Cosmic activity over the coming week in the area of your chart that governs your wellbeing encourages you to share your workload with partners and colleagues. They will help if you ask them nicely. ,gemini,A friend or work colleague will try to make a big deal of something that you think is of little or no importance today. Strive to see the situation from their point of view but don’t let their negativity start to rub off on you. ,gemini,You don’t seem to be short of admirers but don’t let it go to your head. Also, watch out it does not affect your health. If you accept each and every social invitation that comes your way you will exhaust yourself before the end of the week. ,gemini,Everyone wants something from you. Everyone wants you to give. Maybe you need to remind them that you have a life of your own to lead and don’t have to be at their beck and call every minute of the day. Time to be brutal. ,gemini,No matter how well intentioned your words may be others are sure to take them the wrong way, so be careful what you say. Twenty­four hours from now everything will be back to normal and everyone will be on your side again.
gemini,If you are typical of your sign you always seem to be on the go, but even a Gemini needs to slow down once in a while and cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart invites you to indulge only in what makes you feel good.
gemini,Don’t complain too loudly if what you get this week is not what you want because it will make others think you are ungrateful. The fact is they owe you nothing and you can count yourself lucky they think enough of you to at least give you something. ,gemini,You may not be much in the mood for work today but that’s okay. Your mind is focused on more personal issues and until you have got them sorted out you won’t be able to give the professional side of your life the attention it requires.
gemini,Why is it that everyone but you seems to have got it wrong? Why is that no one can see what you can see? Whatever the reason may be all you can do is carry on with your own way of doing things. Others are not your responsibility. ,gemini,There is a real chance that you will come into money before the end of the week, but you may sabotage the situation if you get suspicious and wonder what other people’s motives may be. They are not trying to trick you, they are trying to help you. ,gemini,If you need to make a new start of some kind now is the time to speak up and let others know what it is you intend to do – and that your intentions are serious. But don’t get so serious that you forget how to have fun. ,gemini,If you have fallen out with a partner, loved one or friend, or even a work colleague, this is the perfect day to get back on good terms with them. It may mean having to admit that you were in the wrong but it will be worth it. ,gemini,Nothing will faze you this weekend. You are at your best when challenged and current aspects indicate that you will be challenged several times over the next 48 hours – and will come through each and every test with your head held high.
gemini,You are in a practical state of mind at the moment and that will help you to get lots done as the new week gets under way. Don’t just do things for yourself though, be available for friends and family members who need assistance.
gemini,You will get conflicting advice from a dozen different directions over the next 24 hours but deep down you know what must be done, so get on and do it. Sometimes you just have to trust your instincts and hope for the best. The best will happen.
gemini,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Sagittarius will bring home to you the fact that you cannot always be top dog. It will also remind you that if you want to get things done you must be ready to work with others as part of a team. ,gemini,There is no point blaming yourself for events over which you have no control. What has occurred in recent days will have happened anyway, so stop beating yourself up and start focusing on the things in your life that you can exercise some influence over. ,gemini,Is your family more important to you than your work? That is the question you will have to answer today and it won’t be easy. Eventually you will have to find a stable balance between your home life and your more worldly ambitions. ,gemini,Geminis are supposed to be daring. Geminis are supposed to take risks. So what happened? Somewhere along the way you seem to have forgotten that life is meant to be a great adventure. Make today the day when you rediscover your true nature again.
gemini,For some strange reason you seem compelled to take the kind of risks that cannot possibly pay off. The current cosmic set-up warns that you are in one of your more irresponsible moods. Try to think what the consequences might be before you act.
gemini,Being a Gemini you don’t often hide yourself away but if you feel the need to escape the hurly-burly of everyday life now is the time to take a break, or even a vacation. Get as far away from your usual environment as you possibly can.
gemini,Don’t dismiss out of hand what someone suggests today, even if it is the kind of thing you would usually prefer to avoid. You need to take a different approach in certain areas, especially on the home front where things have got a bit dull of late. ,gemini,What happens today and later in the week will bring to light something you have been trying to hide from yourself. If you want to get over it now is the time to face up to your demons. They are not as terrifying as you imagine. ,gemini,You will give freely of your time and energy today but take care that your generosity is not abused by people who would happily let you do it all. Sometimes you can be too easygoing for your own good. Give only to those who deserve your help.
gemini,You may go over the top a bit today if you think you are being cheated out of what you deserve. Before you start firing off accusations in all directions make sure you have got the evidence to back them up, otherwise you could look foolish.
gemini,Can you trust what other people tell you? Most of the time you can but today’s full moon warns that what you hear over the next 24 hours may be only half of what you need to know. Today, at least, it’s okay to be suspicious.
gemini,If you are too eager to make up your mind about something or someone today you may have to change it again later. The facts may seem obvious enough but with changes planet Uranus strong in your chart things are not as simple as they seem.
gemini,An affair of the heart will go extremely well over the next few days. On the work front, however, be wary of someone who approaches you with a proposition that sounds too good to be true. It could cost you money and damage your reputation.
gemini,This is already a good time for you but it will get even better when Mercury, your ruler, changes signs towards the end of the week. Social activities and travels plans are under excellent stars at the moment, so get out and about and have fun.
gemini,With Mercury, your ruler, squaring up to Mars, planet of conflict, it is odds on you will find yourself falling out with someone today. Nothing bad is likely to come of it so long as you don’t say or do anything that cannot be taken back later. ,gemini,This is one of those days when you will get more done if you don’t try too hard. Also, you might want to take yourself a little less seriously. In fact, forget about work altogether – go out with your friends and have a good time. ,gemini,As from today you will be back in command and eager to make up for lost time. But don’t be so eager that you neglect to use your brain. Mars remains in your fellow Air sign of Libra only until the weekend, so make sure you plan ahead. ,gemini,If you are the kind of Gemini who learns from other people’s mistakes you will start 2016 with a major advantage over your rivals. Let others rush in without a second thought or a backward glance – you will benefit from their errors.
gemini,Don’t worry too much if you exchange some less than kind words with a partner or loved one over the next 48 hours because it’s really no big deal. Everyone falls out once in a while, even those who like or even love one another. ,gemini,What happens next will remind you that if you want to get on in life you have to work with the forces that are trying to guide you. Deep down you know you will have to go in a certain direction eventually, so why not go now? ,gemini,This is a trying time for you and with your ruler Mercury beginning one of its retrograde phases today things may look a little gloomy. You won’t find it so easy to reach out to the world but that’s okay. Try looking in at yourself for a change.
gemini,There may be a lot of stress in your life at the moment but you will find ways to handle it. One way, of course, is to take nothing too seriously. If you can’t laugh at yourself and at life in general then you’re doing it wrong. ,gemini,It is too late to back out of something you thought would be easy – you must go through with it and hope that it does not take too much out of you. Strive to make a good job of it and, next time, don’t volunteer so eagerly. ,gemini,Your luck will change for the better over the next few days but to make the most of it you need to start looking ahead and making plans. You also need to believe that you deserve it when good things come your way. No one deserves it more!,gemini,As far as loved ones are concerned you can do no wrong at the moment. You could, of course, take that as an excuse to misbehave but if you are wise you will find ways to let those you care for know that you are there for them too. ,gemini,Take a long, hard look at your philosophy of life and decide how it can be improved. One way is to stop imagining that you are automatically entitled to the good things in life. Like everyone else you have got to work for them.
gemini,You are very much flavor of the month at the moment and must not hesitate to take advantage of other people’s good feelings toward you. Travel will broaden your horizons and bring new opportunities, so be ready to move in a new direction.
gemini,It may look as if someone you work or do business with has been cheating you but the planets warn you cannot trust your senses at the moment, so don’t say or do anything provocative, at least not until you can see things a little more clearly. ,gemini,Any promises you made in recent weeks will have to be made good today and tomorrow. If you find you cannot deliver then you won’t be popular – worse, you may have to pay compensation of some kind. Don’t promise so much next time. ,gemini,Don’t just sit by yourself watching the world go by, get out there and take part. Choose your friends carefully but don’t get so hung up on other people’s good points and bad points that you don’t leave yourself time to have fun. ,gemini,Be very careful what you choose to believe today because the planets warn you will be more open than usual to negative propaganda. Anyone who tries to tell you that you must follow their lead is not to be trusted. Listen only to your own inner voice.
gemini,There is no need to apologize if you make a mistake – in fact you should carry on as if nothing has occurred. Your rivals are waiting for a chance to put you down and the moment you say sorry is the moment they will pounce.
gemini,You seem to be having second thoughts about a deal that up until now you have been so confident about. The planets warn if you pull out now it will create a lot of bad blood – but, one way or another, you have to make a decision.
gemini,Love will come back into your life over the next few weeks – and you will feel more in tune with the world around you generally. Don’t wait for other people to tell you how much they care – tell them how much you care first.
gemini,Do something positive with your time and energy today. The good news is that beneficial cosmic activity will raise your spirits and make you believe that all things are possible. But while the planets may set the scene, it’s up to you to play the part.
gemini,One of the most positive times of the year begins for you today. You will be constantly busy over the next few weeks, dealing with people who inspire you and issues that bring out the best in you. How far can you go? As far as your imagination lets you.
gemini,There is excitement in the air at the moment – you can feel that something special is going to happen. The Sun in Aquarius over the next few weeks will bring new opportunities your way, and give you the confidence to make something of them. ,gemini,You have been ignoring certain warning signals and pretending that nothing can go wrong. The planets warn if what you ignore can in some way affect your earning power it could cost you dear over the weekend. Get your act together before it’s too late.
gemini,There is only one way to deal with your fears and that is to face them. The planets urge you to be brave and face up to what has been causing you so much anxiety. Make this the day when you start fighting back – and fight hard.
gemini,Push all your worries to one side this week and go out and enjoy yourself. Others may say you are avoiding your problems, and maybe you are, but this is one of those times when avoiding problems may turn out to be the best way of dealing with them.
gemini,Something that costs a bit more than you wanted to pay will turn out to be an excellent investment, while something you get on the cheap will turn out to be a waste of money. Everything is the wrong way round at the moment.
gemini,If you are not planning a trip of some sort then you should be. Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs long-distance travel will inspire you to expand your horizons. Don’t tie yourself down to home and the office.
gemini,The Sun in Aquarius endows you with limitless self-confidence, but other aspects warn you must not take too much for granted. It would be easy to fall into the trap of believing that nothing can possibly go wrong – and that’s just when it will. ,gemini,You need to make some serious savings. The simple fact is you are living beyond your means and sooner or later you will have to make the necessary adjustments. They will be even more painful in the long-term if you don’t make them now. ,gemini,You may be tempted to cut corners today in order to get yourself an advantage. Don’t. Even if you succeed you won’t feel good about yourself. And if you don’t succeed your rivals will take delight in your embarrassment at being caught out. ,gemini,Don’t live in the past and don’t dwell on your mistakes. As an open, outgoing Gemini you should be looking to the future. Others may not be so positive but your optimism can be and should be an inspiration to everyone you meet. ,gemini,You have been putting a lot of effort into various projects without getting too far, but don’t lose heart because the planets indicate you will see results very soon. Keep plugging away and almost before you realize it you will be a major star.
gemini,It seems you have been avoiding a task you think will be unpleasant but if you tackle it today it really won’t be so bad. Friends and family members will help if you let them know that you need assistance. Don’t forget: they can’t read your mind. ,gemini,What someone tells you today may sound reasonable but can you be sure they know what they are talking about? Just because someone calls themselves an “expert” does not mean you should accept what they say. Checks the facts for yourself and draw your own conclusions.
gemini,You have something to say and certain people are unlikely to welcome your words. That’s up to them but for you the truth is sacred and you won’t keep quiet just to make others feel good. Whether or not it offends their sensibilities is not your concern. ,gemini,Don’t worry if you find yourself in a minority of one, and don’t let it change what you are doing. Being the kind of person who stands out from the crowd it is inevitable that you will be criticized by those who would prefer everyone to think and act alike. ,gemini,The only thing that is holding you back is your reluctance to hurt other people’s feelings. It’s good that you should think of them first but you also need to think of your own needs and desires. It’s not all about you, but it mostly is!,gemini,Be careful you don’t get caught up in mass hysteria. Others can rant and rave and pull their hair out by the handful if they so choose, but you must remain calm. No matter what happens over the next 48 hours it’s not the end of the world.
gemini,You will have plenty to say for yourself over the next few days – no change there then! In true Gemini fashion you will speak your mind fearlessly in situations where others are too scared to venture an opinion. Good for you.
gemini,No matter how busy you may be you must find time to think about serious issues. Yes, working and earning a living is important but there are also some BIG questions that need to be dealt with, the type that can only be answered by looking within.
gemini,Why are some people so irritable? Whatever the reason – and there may be no reason at all – you won’t change them, so don’t waste time trying. Today’s influences will bring out the worst in those who lack self-control, but it will bring out the best in you. ,gemini,The overall message of the planets is one of optimism and good fortune, so why are you worrying so much? What happens over the next two or three days will finally convince you that fear is not only a useless emotion but also a dangerous one.
gemini,Be careful when talking to people who may not share your ideas or your outlook on life. Not everyone will approve of your willingness to question the accepted wisdom and while you may not care what they think they can still do you harm. ,gemini,Expand your horizons and get to know more about the world. A long-distance trip would be an ideal way to make use of today’s cosmic influences but if that isn’t possible at least broaden your mind. There is always something new to learn.
gemini,If you are carrying a grudge against someone then it’s time to let it go. Yes, of course, they deserve your displeasure but that’s not the point – the point is that you are the one who is suffering from it, so forgive and forget and move on.
gemini,Just because you are the life and soul of the party most of the time does not mean you don’t have days when you like to sit quietly and think about the meaning of life – and this is one of them. You’ll be back in party mode tomorrow.
gemini,If you are planning a surprise for a loved one be careful who you confide in because this is one of those days when information could easily slip out. It may not spoil the occasion but it could take the gloss off it a bit. ,gemini,Some people talk for the sake of talking but you’re not one of them, are you? You need to cut short meaningless gossip today and focus only on what is of genuine importance. Don’t worry if you hurt others’ feelings – only your feelings matter. ,gemini,Keep a cool head today and don’t let anyone tempt you to do something silly. The planets will put some rather way-out ideas into your head over the next 24 hours but, on this occasion, they are the kind of ideas you must reject. ,gemini,This is an important time for career matters and you are sure to get several opportunities to show what you can do. Seize them and use them. If you allow these chances to pass you by they won’t come around again for a very long time. ,gemini,You may be convinced that a certain course of action is correct but it will still pay you to wait a while before committing yourself. You should certainly let Monday’s full moon come and go before making any decisions you can’t get out of.
gemini,You will tread on a few toes over the next two or three days but maybe that is no bad thing. Both at home and at work you must make sure everyone knows that you will not be deflected from the course you have chosen to take.
gemini,You have been astonishingly ambitious of late but something will happen this week that makes you wonder if it is worth all the effort. No matter how disillusioned you may be you must not give up the struggle because people are counting on you. ,gemini,It seems you are trying so hard to please one person that someone else feels they are being neglected. If you want both relationships to survive you are going to have to be more even-handed. As from tomorrow that should be a bit easier.
gemini,Money and possessions are important, of course, but they cannot on their own make you happy, so forget about your cashflow problems and focus on affairs of the heart. Don’t worry about making ends meet – it’s meeting the right person that matters. ,gemini,Be aware of someone’s doubts but don’t let them influence you too much. The important thing is that you have confidence in yourself and with your ruler Mercury in one of the better areas of your chart you won’t lack for self-belief. ,gemini,If you get the chance to travel today you must take it, even if it means breaking other promises or plans. People you meet while on the move, both in your own neighborhood and further afield, will bring you luck – and maybe love too!,gemini,It does not matter what obstacles fate puts in your path, you have what it takes to get past them. Don’t worry if the task in front of you looks huge – once you get to grips with it you will realize it’s not really that big at all. ,gemini,Over the coming week you will see with total clarity what it is you are here for and what it is you have to do. You can accept the challenge and fulfill your destiny, or you can reject it and wonder always what might have been.
gemini,You need to stop worrying what other people think about you. You are who you are for a reason and no one has the right to demand you be anyone or anything else. That won’t stop them trying, of course, but they can’t force you to listen.
gemini,It seems you are trying so hard to please one person that someone else feels they are being neglected. If you want both relationships to survive you are going to have to be more even-handed. As from tomorrow that should be a bit easier.
gemini,Try something you have never tried before, something risky and maybe even a little bit outrageous. Others may not approve but, if anything, that will make you even more determined to go through with it. You enjoy pushing limits and rocking boats.
gemini,Things may not have worked out the way you hoped they would but there is no need to worry about it and even less need to change direction. What happens over the next 24 hours will put everything right and you will soon be smiling again.
gemini,Why are you so defensive? Every time someone says something you take it as a personal slight. You are, of course, overreacting but the good news is this phase won’t last for long – a few days from now you will have forgotten all about it.
gemini,You want to hurry things along and get a project rolling but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. If you are absolutely certain that what you are planning cannot fail then by all means go ahead. If not, take some time out. ,gemini,You enjoy saying things that shock and as Mars moves into your opposite sign you won’t hesitate to upset a few people. Just remember that when you dish it out you have to be ready to take it as well. You won’t have it all your own way. ,gemini,Something will get under your skin today – something you just can’t leave alone. It may be something interesting, it may even be something important, but don’t shout and scream about it. This is something for you alone to investigate and make use of.
gemini,You have done some remarkable things of late but there could be a price to pay if you push yourself too hard. The planets urge you to be less relentless in your pursuit of fame and fortune. You are who you are and that’s more than enough.
gemini,You will get the chance to show your leadership qualities today and people in positions of power are sure to be impressed. You have everything it takes to reach the top, so stop thinking and dreaming and start acting. Only you can make it happen.
gemini,Some Geminis are ambitious and some are not but all Geminis like to be noticed and what happens over the next 24 hours will give you the opportunity to step into the spotlight. Unveil your special talent and put on a show. ,gemini,This is one of those occasions when you must push your own needs and desires to one side and do what you can to help those who, for whatever reason, are incapable of helping themselves. Friendships and family ties come first today.
gemini,No matter how ambitious you are the planets indicate it’s time for a reality check. What happens this weekend will remind you there is more to life than getting to the top. There is learning, there is laughter and, most important of all, there is love.
gemini,You need to get your act together and start making things happen. The important thing is that you make a beginning, no matter how small or limited it might be, because once you have started your momentum will carry you through.
gemini,By all means help a friend who has made a mistake but make sure they know it is not going to become a regular occurrence. If they carry on making the same errors you may have to withhold your assistance until they get the message.
gemini,Mercury, your ruler, at odds with Jupiter, means that someone in a position of authority will try to bend you to their will today. Don’t let it happen. There are times in life when you must make a stand and this is one of them. ,gemini,Stick to methods and routines you are familiar with and don’t be tempted to try something new just because you want to look fashionable. Your rivals will be delighted if you get it wrong and make a fool of yourself. Don’t give them the satisfaction. ,gemini,There have been a few storm clouds in your life of late but the outlook is improving and a week or so from now there will be plenty of sunshine in your life. On the work front, don’t get confrontational and antagonize people in positions of power. ,gemini,You have worked hard in recent weeks and your efforts have not gone unnoticed. Employers and other important people are impressed by your attitude and there could be a promotion coming your way in the near future. Life is looking up for you now. ,gemini,You would be wise to wait until the Sun changes signs tomorrow before making your next move. According to the planets you have been focusing too much on one particular objective and need to consider other options. Take your time and get it right.
gemini,Not everyone will agree with what you have to say this week but the confident way in which you express yourself will convince most people that you know what you are talking about. Let’s just hope you are not making it up as you go along!,gemini,Everyone makes mistakes, even a Gemini, so if you have messed things up in some way just admit it and move on. The less seriously you take what happens the more you will find you enjoy your life. Laugh and the world will laugh with you.
gemini,If there are things going on in the world that you would like to change then by all means get involved. If you want to make a difference you must join forces with like-minded people. Together you can start making good things happen. ,gemini,The more you try to persuade others that your way of looking at things is best the more likely they are to reject your advice. Today’s lunar eclipse is there to remind you that all you can do is live according to your own beliefs. You don’t need converts. ,gemini,There is only so much you can do on your own and that is especially true today. With Mercury, your ruler, strong at the moment you will find it easy to persuade others to do things for you. Why go it alone when you don’t have to? ,gemini,You have a fascination with conspiracy theories and while what you hear today may sound outrageous something about it rings true. Could you be off the mark? Yes. Could you embarrass yourself? Yes. But that won’t deter you in the slightest. ,gemini,It may not be easy to put yourself in other people’s shoes and see things from their point of view but you must try. The planets indicate if you make the effort over the next 48 hours you will be rewarded in unexpected ways.
gemini,According to the planets you may have got the wrong end of the stick about something and if you act on your misguided ideas the results could be disastrous. Check the facts, then check them again, and again, before making your move.
gemini,You will need to be on your guard today, especially where money matters are concerned. Mercury’s link to Pluto, planet of wealth, warns that some people will make promises they won’t be able to keep – so try not to believe everything you hear. ,gemini,No matter how hard you try to be fair with other people today it is highly unlikely they will be fair with you. But why should that bother you? With your ruler Mercury linked to genius planet Uranus you can easily outwit them.
gemini,You may be in one of your more playful moods at the moment but you are advised to avoid making jokes about issues that certain people do not find funny. Their sense of humor failure, while amusing in itself, could affect you adversely at work. ,gemini,The planets warn this is not a good weekend to make changes or take risks, especially if you are low on cash. Be especially wary of get-rich-quick schemes. Act on the assumption that they are designed solely to part you from your money.
gemini,There are so many reasons for you to be happy, and there will be one more early in the week when someone you have not seen for a while comes back into your life. Those old feelings you had for each other are still there! ,gemini,You need to build alliances with people who share your outlook on life. If the world needs changing – and it does – the only way it is going to happen is if those who are committed to making things better get together and work as a team.
gemini,The more someone tempts you with some kind of get-rich-quick offer the more you must resist. The planets warn that if you follow their lead you will end up losing a lot more than you gain, and not just financially.
gemini,If you want to get things done over the next 24 hours you will need to be crafty – your middle name! You don’t have to lie to those you live and work with, but you do have to keep your true motives hidden. Your future could depend on it. ,gemini,No matter how sure you may be that what you are doing is correct it would still be wise to get a second opinion. Most likely there is a small but important detail that has been overlooked, one that could trip you up financially later on. ,gemini,Others may frown at your behavior but only because they wish they could be as carefree and optimistic as you. The more certain people try to convince you that life is a serious business the more you should go out of your way to have fun.
gemini,How you arrived at a certain conclusion does not matter – the only thing that counts is that you know it is the right thing to do. Seek out people who share your outlook over the coming week. Together you can make things happen.
gemini,This is an excellent time for anything to do with communications, so if you have emails to send or instructions to issue get cracking. Also, if you have a message you want to give to the world now is the time to go public with it.
gemini,Something that comes at you out of the blue today will please you no end. Good news to do with love or money, or maybe both, is a certainty and you may even start to believe that your luck is on the turn at last. Maybe it is.
gemini,You have loads of confidence but it may incline you to be a bit reckless. The planets warn there is a danger you could take too much for granted, so think before you act and find ways to learn from other people’s mistakes. ,gemini,What happens today may come as a surprise but it will be the kind of surprise you enjoy. Mercury, your ruler, linked to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will do wonders for your popularity. Find ways to turn that popularity into cash. ,gemini,No matter how tough life may have been in recent weeks it will get easier over the next few days – that is a promise from the stars. It would help, of course, if you made an effort to get your thoughts in some sort of logical order. ,gemini,The message of the planets this weekend is that you need to be more relaxed about your ambitions. It is good to aim high but it is not good to put yourself under pressure day in and day out. There are more important things in life.
gemini,Partners and loved ones will be demanding today and during the early part of the new week and you would be wise to do what they ask of you. You will soon be back in control but for now you are advised to go with the flow.
gemini,If you don’t feel like working up a sweat today then . . . don’t. You won’t be able to stop completely, of course, but you can delegate your more tiresome duties to other people. Ask nicely and they will go out of their way to assist you.
gemini,Like everyone else you’ve had your share of successes and failures but the question is: what have you learned from them? Look back over recent months and evaluate what has been good and bad in your life. And don’t judge yourself too harshly.
gemini,You seem to be rather anxious of late but the good news is that your anxiety has no basis in reality. The even better news is that once Friday’s full moon has come and gone you will quickly be back to your outgoing and optimistic best.
gemini,You should spend more time thinking now than actually doing, because the Sun’s transit of the most introspective area of your chart will help you give shape to your plans. You don’t have to be on the go constantly Gemini! ,gemini,You have never been a stickler for routine, so you won’t mind too much if your schedule is messed up today. You may even enjoy it. You don’t want to get bogged down in details, you want to be out there having a good time.
gemini,The line between love and hate can be narrow and with Mars moving retrograde in your opposite sign you may not realize that you have crossed it. If you speak or act in ways you regret this weekend you must make amends quickly.
gemini,You seem to fear the worst for some reason. Maybe it’s your sixth sense warning you of impending doom, but more likely it is because you have allowed yourself to be influenced by negative attitudes. Keep telling yourself that it’s all good, because it is. ,gemini,You may honestly believe that you are capable of almost anything, and maybe you are, but some people out there have the power to limit your success if they think you are getting too big for your boots. A little bit of modesty will go a long way. ,gemini,Friends and relatives can see your problems better than you can see them yourself, so don’t be annoyed if they try to give you advice. If you do as they suggest you might even save yourself a lot of trouble – or is trouble something you enjoy? ,gemini,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart is playing havoc with your ability to think straight at the moment. Slow down your thoughts over the next 24 hours and don’t be tempted to get carried away on outrageous flights of fancy.
gemini,Someone else’s ideas and opinions may seem appealing but you have got a mind of your own and must use it. Trust what your inner voice tells you over the next few days – it’s more reliable than a thousand so-called “experts.”,gemini,You will learn something about a friend or colleague today that is interesting to say the least but don’t let anyone else know about it, at least not yet. If you spill the beans now you will do your reputation for integrity no good at all.
gemini,You won’t have to do anything special as far as affairs of the heart are concerned – loved ones will go out of their way to make you feel good. And it is no more than you deserve – you have made them feel good many times in the past.
gemini,The more you ask for over the next 24 hours the more you will get over the coming week, but don’t ask for too much or you may get more than you can handle! Along similar lines, go easy on the food and drink. ,gemini,You may not be given to flights of fancy but cosmic activity in the most imaginative area of your chart urges you to let go of your limits and inhibitions and do something out of the ordinary. Help yourself, and help other people too.
gemini,Any day can be a new beginning and with so many positive influences at the moment this is one of those times when success is guaranteed. First, of course, you must get off your backside and actually do something. What will that be?,gemini,You will be looking for ways to expand your income over the next few days and you are more likely to find them if you take advice from those who have the experience to guide you. If nothing else you can learn from their mistakes.
gemini,If you give in over something trivial today it will send the wrong signals, especially to those you have to deal with on the work front. This is one of those occasions when you must act tough even if you don’t feel tough. ,gemini,You will find that your ability to talk to people, and be understood, opens doors for you today and over the weekend. This would also be a good time to remind a loved one that you will always be there for them.
gemini,The decisions you take this weekend will have far-reaching consequences, so think before you act and only act if you absolutely have to. You need to get the balance right between being cautious and being adventurous. Steer the middle way.
gemini,You will find your voice and say something wonderful over the next few days. If you have not got anything of a social nature planned for early in the new week you need to get planning quick because your popularity will be sky-high.
gemini,It may surprise you that a friend is suddenly so difficult to get along with, especially as you have been on such good terms of late, but they have their ups and downs, just like you. Give them the time and space they need.
gemini,Your fate is in someone else’s hands at the moment but there is no reason to worry about it. Some people enjoy being generous and one such person will go out of their way to smooth your path through life and make you smile. Lucky you. ,gemini,Someone will point out where you have been going wrong and if you are as smart as you think you are you will listen and learn. Put your ego to one side, stand back from yourself and see the wisdom in what they are trying to tell you. ,gemini,Why so distrustful? Why so suspicious? Whatever the reason you need to get over it or you could miss out on a wonderful opportunity. If someone approaches you with an idea or proposal don’t turn them away – it could be just what you need. ,gemini,You don’t have to explain yourself to anybody and with your ruler Mercury on good terms with passion planet Pluto today you won’t hesitate to shout at anyone who says you should. If you start making excuses for yourself there will be no end to it!,gemini,Everyone else seems to be having fun but you can’t work up much enthusiasm for life. Don’t worry. Things will change dramatically a week or so from now when the Sun moves into your sign. Until then, keep a low profile. ,gemini,The Sun’s move into your birth sign on the 20th will mark the start of a more positive phase. Between now and then though, conserve your physical, mental and emotional strength. Don’t waste your energy on issues that are of no importance. ,gemini,You may want to stand back from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and be alone with your thoughts for a while but too many people have a call on your time and your energy. Give up any ideas you had of a peaceful start to the week.
gemini,You may be tempted to focus on details today but if you do you will miss the bigger picture and that would be a shame. The fact is a number of important things are coming together, so keep your wits about you and keep your eyes open. ,gemini,Yes, of course, you would like to turn the clock back and undo the mistakes of the past, but that isn’t possible, so don’t waste your time dreaming of what might have been. If you learn from your mistakes you will grow stronger.
gemini,All things are possible for those born under the sign of the Twins and if you don’t quite believe that now you will certainly believe it tomorrow and over the weekend as the Sun moves into your sign. Start making plans – and make them big.
gemini,A new solar year begins for you today and what you do over the next 72 hours will to a large extent determine how good, or how bad, the coming year is going to be. Whatever you have to do or choose to do, do it with love. ,gemini,It seems like everyone is trying to get you to see things their way and it is beginning to annoy you. Today’s full moon means you will get advice from all directions, but you don’t have to take it. You know what needs to be done. ,gemini,The Sun in your sign opposes Mars this week, so you must be extra careful not to let minor disputes become major disagreements. That applies to all areas of your life but particularly to relationships. Don’t turn a good friend into a dangerous enemy. ,gemini,Everything seems so busy at the moment but when Venus moves into your sign tomorrow the pace of life should settle down. Not that a little bit of stress is such a bad thing – it tends to bring out the best in you.
gemini,Now that the Sun is moving through your sign your confidence will return and you will be looking for ways to make your mark. And with love planet Venus also moving in your favor today it’s unlikely you will be doing it on your own!,gemini,You must keep your wits about you today – and your emotions in check. While others are running round in circles you will stay calm and be in a better position to see the pitfalls that they, in their excitement, have managed to miss. ,gemini,No matter how calm you may look on the outside, on the inside you are a raging ball of anger. Someone, somewhere will be on the receiving end of your frustrations today and it’s unlikely to be a pleasant sight. They won’t cross you again! ,gemini,As Mars moves back into the work and wellbeing area of your chart today you may find you have some extra energy to play with but that must not be used as an excuse to overdo it. Don’t overload your body, or your mind, over the next 24 hours. ,gemini,The Sun in your sign makes this the ideal time for new beginnings. If there is an area of your life in which you would like to sweep away everything and start again from scratch then go for it. You are limited only by your own imagination.
gemini,You can do no wrong now and your confidence is through the ceiling. Get out there and show the world, including the critics and the cynics, who you are and what you can do – just about anything if the planets are to be believed. ,gemini,The Sun in your sign gives you the courage and the confidence you need to make the kind of changes you know are necessary. Don’t worry what others might think about what you are doing – seize this opportunity or you will always regret it.
gemini,You seem to be getting a lot of positive signals from someone but you are not sure if you can trust them. According to the planets you cannot afford not to trust them, because in some way, shape or form your fate is in their hands. ,gemini,You may get a bit emotional over the next 24 hours – someone or something will upset you deeply. Later, when you have recovered your composure, you will realize how silly it all was, but for now, if you must, have a good cry.
gemini,Don’t worry if someone you are fond of is cold and distant today – it is not because of anything you have done. They are going through one of those phases when the world seems more gray than it actually is. Do what you can to cheer them up.
gemini,The more someone tries to scare you into doing something today the more you must dig in your heels and refuse to go along with their plans. They don’t seem to realize you are not the sort who can be bullied – you’re far too smart for that.
gemini,The more someone tries to scare you into doing something today the more you must dig in your heels and refuse to go along with their plans. They don’t seem to realize you are not the sort who can be bullied – you’re far too smart for that.
gemini,The new moon in your sign means you are supremely confident in your abilities – you believe there is nothing you cannot do. But don’t forget that you are human and have limits like everyone else. Know what they are and work with them.
gemini,Don’t worry if you find it hard to put your thoughts into words today because once Mercury moves into your sign at the weekend your communication skills will bloom. Between now and then just make sure you know what’s going on.
gemini,You will gain a lot more respect if you are not quite so respectful to people who are being rude to you. That is not an invitation to be rude yourself but there is no law that says you have to be nice to everyone you meet.
gemini,Just because others are behaving badly does not mean you have to do the same. On the contrary, the planets warn if you go too far today you will regret it before the end of the week, so steer a middle course in everything you do.
gemini,Someone is dragging their feet (again) and almost daring you to do something about it. And this time you will. The reason they are taunting you like this is because they have noticed how easygoing you have been of late. That needs to change.
gemini,What happened yesterday and the day before that is in the past and is of no importance – the only thing that matters is what you are going to do today and tomorrow and the day after that. So what are your plans exactly?,gemini,It may seem as if you don’t have a care in the world, but deep down you have worries like everyone else and one of those worries will come to the surface over the next 48 hours. Don’t ignore it, deal with it and have done with it. ,gemini,Mind planet Mercury joins the Sun in your sign this week, so any doubts you may have had about what you are doing will be swept away quickly. In the days ahead you will take giant strides in all areas of your life. ,gemini,What happens today will catch you by surprise but you can profit from it if you stay calm and act quickly. If you get the chance to invest in an idea that sounds like fun then take the risk – it could pay off in a big way.
gemini,Your mind is sharp as a knife and anyone who thinks they can put one over on you is going to be disappointed. Just make sure that what you say about other people is true: there is no point making enemies for no good reason.
gemini,You may think you are in a strong enough position to force your will on others but the planets warn your strategy could backfire. Don’t be too pushy today or you could end up dancing to someone else’s tune, and that would be embarrassing. ,gemini,You will be tempted to take drastic measures to put right a situation that has been worrying you for quite some time. That’s fine, but make sure you think things through carefully before you proceed, or you could end up making matters worse. ,gemini,Make sure you get what you deserve today, both emotionally and financially. Others will happily give you less than you have earned if they think they can get away with it, but they won’t get away with it if you stand up for yourself. ,gemini,By all means reach out to other people but be aware that today’s Saturn-Neptune link means you probably cannot trust them. If what someone tells you is precisely what you were hoping to hear it could be they are not being honest with you.
gemini,Although the Sun leaves your birth sign tomorrow you must not slow down – keep the momentum you have built up in recent weeks going strong. This is also a great time to be making plans, both in your personal life and in your career.
gemini,There are some things you can change and some things you cannot and if you don’t know the difference then you need to find out. You can, quite easily, make life easier for yourself by changing less but, for some reason, you find that difficult to do. ,gemini,You seem to be under a lot of pressure at the moment, but it comes mostly from yourself, not other people. Try to be more relaxed about what you are doing, at home and at work. Treat yourself kindly and others will treat you kindly as well. ,gemini,Everyone makes mistakes, yes even a Gemini, so don’t beat yourself up if you make an error of judgment over the next 24 hours. Your rivals will, of course, point out your faults and failings but there is little they can do to actually hurt you. ,gemini,Try not to dwell on what might have been. What’s done is done and cannot be undone and the sooner you accept that the sooner you can get on with your life. Life is still good, especially on the work front where you have much to look forward to. ,gemini,There are times when it all comes together, when everything makes sense, and while it has probably not quite reached that level yet don’t worry because it will very soon. It will happen quicker, of course, if you think positive at all times.
gemini,Listen carefully to both sides of a story you hear over the next 48 hours because although the first version you hear may sound compelling the second version will make you think again. Don’t assume that because someone is a friend they are telling you the truth.
gemini,Whatever illusions you have been working under regarding your financial situation they will be smashed beyond repair over the next few days – and that’s good. It’s time to see your position for what it is, not what you wish it might be.
gemini,What happens over the next 24 hours will be important but far more important is how you choose to react to it. That applies especially to money matters and business negotiations where, if you lose your temper, you could lose out financially too. ,gemini,Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even a Gemini – so don’t be too hard on yourself. The important thing is that you learn from your errors, so look at your shortcomings openly and honestly, then resolve to do something constructive about them.
gemini,Wishful thinking can be fun but it can also be dangerous. You must focus on the realities of your situation today. You may have no end of confidence in yourself but confidence alone will not be enough – you also need more practical aims. ,gemini,You can either go along with what others expect of you to keep them happy, or you can do what your conscience tells you is right even though you know your name will be mud. Since when have you cared what others think of you?,gemini,You may be eager to get things done but your options for action are limited. Which of course is frustrating but it is also the planets’ way of telling you to slow down. If nothing much seems to be happening why not take things easy for a while?,gemini,You will go from one extreme to the other this weekend: first you will be hugely emotional, then you will bottle up your feelings and pretend they do not exist. The former approach is by far the less dangerous. Let it all out.
gemini,Money matters will eat up more of your time than you would like during the early part of the week but that’s okay. The most important thing now is that you get your financial house in order while you still hold the purse strings. ,gemini,There will be changes in your financial situation over the next few days and most likely they will be big. Whether they are “good” or “bad” changes is not important – what matters is that you seize the opportunity to make a new start.
gemini,There are so many ways you can improve the quality of your life but the most important is to stop worrying what other people think about you. You are who you are for a reason and no one has any right to suggest you be anything else. ,gemini,No effort is too much for you now. There are some days when, no matter how tough the tasks you have to take care of, everything comes easy to you, and this is one of them. Identify what it is you wish to accomplish – then just do it.
gemini,What happens over the next few days should ease your money problems considerably, so stop worrying and let fate take its course. However, don’t be so laid-back that others see you as an easy touch. Keep your cash in your pocket. ,gemini,If you want something enough you will find a way to make it happen. Money matters are under excellent stars at the moment, so don’t be afraid to take a risk when everyone around you is telling you to stick with what you know and trust.
gemini,Any doubts you may have about a financial matter will be swept away this weekend. With the Sun in the money area of your chart linked to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, you know you cannot lose. A positive outlook will lead to positive results.
gemini,There is a luck factor working in your favor at the moment and when Mercury, your ruler, moves in your favor on Thursday it will seem as if you have been dealt the perfect hand. But, of course, it is still up to you how you play it.
gemini,Keep a cool head and don’t let anyone tempt you to do something silly. Mercury, your ruler, at odds with Uranus, will put some strange ideas into your head and, on this occasion, they are the kind of ideas that could cause trouble. Be careful.
gemini,Before you say something outrageous it might be wise to consider how other people are likely to take it. To you it may be nothing more than harmless fun but others may not be quite so easygoing about it. Engage your brain before you speak.
gemini,The planets warn that if you spend more than you can afford today you may find yourself in debt and worrying about how you are going to make ends meet. You need to get your financial house in order, not demolish it further! ,gemini,You enjoy being on the move but today it will pay you to stay right where you are. Get your thoughts together and quieten your emotions too. A busy phase is about to begin and once you start you won’t want, or be able, to stop.
gemini,Try not to be too hard on yourself if you have not yet accomplished what you set out to do. There is no set date by when you have to be rich, famous or whatever else it is you think you should be. Keep at it.
gemini,The planets will encourage you to forget about your cashflow problems and focus on more important matters, such as romance and your creative ambitions. Don’t worry about making ends meet this weekend – it’s meeting the right people that counts.
gemini,The approaching full moon will compel you to take the kind of drastic action you usually prefer to avoid. The most important thing is to realize that, as far as your finances are concerned, nothing can be taken for granted any more.
gemini,You must resist the urge to go on a spree because the approaching full moon warns there will be unexpected bills to pay. At this time of year more than most you must make sure that your finances are in good order. Spend only on essentials.
gemini,You may prefer to avoid confrontation but that won’t be possible while the moon is full. You need to face up to what has come between you and a friend and find a way to deal with it. There may be a few tears before bedtime!,gemini,It would appear that in some way or other you have failed to live up to the impossibly high standards you think you must live by. You need to be a bit more forgiving of yourself today. Despite what some people say you are only human! ,gemini,Life moves in cycles and this part of your Sun cycle is about to change. Hopefully you have resolved outstanding financial issues because over the next few weeks you will want to have fun – and you will find that easier if you have cash in your pocket. ,gemini,Anything to do with your mind will go well for you over the next few days. You are equipped to compete at the highest level, so go for it. Use your imagination and find some way to make your brain power pay – and pay big. ,gemini,Upheavals of one kind or another are to be expected this weekend but try not to react in a negative way. Some people may be rude for no good reason but is it really worth going head-to-head over? You’re big enough to take it. ,gemini,You must be positive. You must believe in yourself. The Sun in one of the more open and outgoing areas of your chart will make it easy for you to impress people and boost your earning power – but the effort must come from you.
gemini,There may seem to be no obvious reason to what happens today but in the greater scheme of things there is a purpose behind it and your task now is to find out what that is. Gemini are naturally curious, so get digging and find out the truth.
gemini,If you are bored with your social scene then change it. There is a really interesting party going on somewhere close by right at this moment and if you make an effort you will find it. Or why not throw a celebration of your own?,gemini,It would be nice to believe that everyone you work with is on your side but you know that probably isn’t true. Watch out for those who envy your position over the next 24 hours – the planets warn they will do anything to trip you up. ,gemini,The most important thing today is to find a way to settle a long-running dispute once and for all. If you allow it to drag on it will distract you from more important matters. Even if it is you who is owed an apology, make the first move. ,gemini,There are times when it is wiser to keep your thoughts to yourself and this is one of them. Even if friends and family members pester you for an opinion you should bite your tongue. Find ways to move the conversation onto safer ground. ,gemini,You will have a lot to say for yourself over the coming week and while most of it will be positive some of it may upset those who don’t take kindly to constructive criticism. Too bad. You are in no mood to pull your punches.
gemini,You will have a lot to say for yourself over the coming week and while most of it will be positive some of it may upset those who don’t take kindly to constructive criticism. Too bad. You are in no mood to pull your punches.
gemini,Cosmic activity in the communications area of your chart means you have plenty to say for yourself and, being a Gemini, you will say it long and loud. Just make sure that what you say is positive and progressive. No one loves a moaner.
gemini,Your powers of persuasion will reach a new high today and tomorrow. Your way with words will win everyone round to your way of thinking and, more importantly, your way of doing things. Take a more hands-on approach if you feel it is necessary.
gemini,Do you act on what common sense tells you or do you act on what your emotions tell you? Actually they should be telling you pretty much the same thing: that it’s time to cut your losses and start again from scratch. It’s all or nothing. ,gemini,It may be in your power to take what it is you desire but the planets warn if you do you will inevitably suffer some kind of long-term setback. If you cannot possess it through fair means it may mean you are not supposed to have it. ,gemini,If a friend needs a shoulder to cry on today you must offer it with no thought of criticism or judgment. Yes, they may deserve whatever has brought them to this point but you don’t need to labor the point, they know that already.
gemini,If you know what it is you are after there is every chance that you will get it this weekend. Whether or not it is good for you remains to be seen but your drive and single-mindedness will see to it that no obstacle stands in your way.
gemini,The truly important things in life, such as love and friendship and fun, will come into focus over the next few days and the not-so-important things, such as money and ambition and status, will be seen for what they really are – illusions.
gemini,You will get upset over something trivial today and will no doubt go over the top emotionally. Don’t be too hard on yourself for it when you finally cool down because you are only human, and on this occasion you were right to get mad.
gemini,The things you valued yesterday are not the same things you should value today, so let go of the past and make room for new opportunities to come into your life. Don’t ever be afraid to move with the times – the future is where it’s at.
gemini,Don’t make too many demands on yourself, nor on other people, over the next 24 hours because you should now be slowing down – and calming down. The coming weekend will be rather exciting, so take it easy while you can.
gemini,No matter how much you own and earn material things like money and possessions will never buy you true love. Let partners and relatives know how much you care for them today and don’t be surprised if they get a bit tearful.
gemini,You may sympathize with a friend’s problems but don’t immediately jump in to put things right for them. Sometimes it is better to let others find their own solutions and this, it seems, is one of those times. Only step in if things really start to fall apart. ,gemini,Try to be more open about your feelings. Let those who care about you know that you care about them too. Sometimes it is hard for even loved ones to know what is going on in your head and in your heart. Spell it out for them.
gemini,You may be right to be suspicious of someone you live, work or do business with but now is not the time to go public about it. It will look to others as if you are being sneaky and it could be your reputation that suffers the most. ,gemini,You will be at your most generous and forgiving today – you will do anything for anyone no matter how much it might cost you personally. Don’t worry if some people try to take advantage of you – that’s for their conscience to deal with.
gemini,You won’t be able to sit still over the next 24 hours, you have to be on the move. You seem to subconsciously understand that you will accomplish more if you get out and about and meet as many new people as you possibly can.
gemini,Travel and social plans are much on your mind at the moment but don’t expect them all to work out as you expected or you may be disappointed. This is a time of rapid change in your life, so stay flexible in all situations. ,gemini,You have a way with words but the planets warn you could go too far today and say things that turn everyone against you. Think before you speak and only speak if what you have to say is positive. Any fool can rant and rave. ,gemini,Be wary of people who flatter you over the next 24 hours because they are hoping to feather their own nests at your expense. That will only happen if you allow it to happen. You don’t need flattery, you know you’re the best.
gemini,A friend or relative is feeling a bit neglected at the moment and you must make it your business to cheer them up. Let them know that they are loved and valued and that you will always be there for them. And mean it too, of course!,gemini,If you need to win your way back into the good books of someone you have fallen out with then now is the time to kiss and make up. You can charm your way past their defences with ease and soon you will be best friends again.
gemini,The more the critics say that what you are doing is misguided the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. The fact is you don’t need anyone’s advice – your own inner voice will guide you, if you have the guts to trust it.
gemini,After all the coming and going of recent weeks you could probably do with a bit of rest but it’s unlikely you will get it. The Sun in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means loved ones will need your assistance – a lot!,gemini,You are in one of your more assertive moods at the moment and that’s good because you will have to deal with people who respond best to a firm hand. Compromise is nice but every now and again you need to remind people that you are the boss.
gemini,If there is something you feel strongly about then make sure the world knows about it – don’t keep it locked up inside. It’s possible you are being too sensitive but in the long-term no harm will come of it – and it will remind others that you are human too. ,gemini,You will need to be a lot more flexible in your working regime over the next few weeks. You will also need to make allowances for the fact that you are not getting any younger. Be kind to yourself, both physically and emotionally.
gemini,Something that used to mean a lot to you but which you have neglected of late will soon become important to you again. It will also become apparent that if you want to make a success of it you must become a true professional. No more half measures.
gemini,Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that nothing can go wrong for you now because that almost guarantees something will. You may be tough but you are not invincible, so be sensible and limit your goals to what you know you can do.
gemini,Even if you are one of those rare Geminis who carefully watches what you spend you will most likely go on a spree this week. Try to buy only those items that come with a no questions asked 30 day money back guarantee, because you will need it.
gemini,Your confidence will soar today and a problem that only a short time ago seemed to be difficult if not impossible to solve will now seem so easy. It’s all about attitude: with the right outlook on life there is nothing you cannot do.
gemini,It may seem as if certain people do nothing but complain but some of what they say is worth listening to, so be patient and open your ears. Try to put yourself in their position – the view may be very different to what you had expected. ,gemini,It may seem as if everyone but you is having fun but don’t be too negative about it. Stay focused on serious things over the next 24 hours, especially on the home front where you will need to deal creatively with differences of opinion. ,gemini,You may have found it difficult to confide in people of late but the cosmic picture is beginning to change and you can, if you wish, let others know what has been bothering you. Don’t make too big an issue of it though.
gemini,What seems such a small problem is giving you a king-size headache at the moment. Which suggests you may have lost your perspective. Focus on the things that really matter, such as your family, your friends and the pursuit of happiness.
gemini,The planets indicate that it will pay you to be more open with partners and loved ones over the next seven days. You may think you are being cute keeping things from them but it will be you who misses out in the long-term. ,gemini,Focus on what you are good at and don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have to do things just to impress other people. If someone encourages you to take unacceptable risks today you will know they are not a true friend.
gemini,You may not be emotional by nature but you are capable of showing those you care for how much they mean to you. Open up and say the kind of words that at other times might get stuck in your throat, starting with “I love you”. ,gemini,You may find it difficult to work up much enthusiasm today but that’s okay. You have been extremely busy of late and will be busy again when Jupiter changes signs later in the week, so by all means take a well-deserved break now. ,gemini,Both family and work matters are under favorable stars at the moment and whatever you focus on over the next 24 hours will turn out well. Just make sure your aims really are your aims and not the aims of loved ones and colleagues. ,gemini,The entry of Jupiter into your fellow Air sign of Libra today marks the start of a 12-month phase where you will be dynamic and creative in the extreme. Whatever the disappointments of recent months, put them behind you and start having fun. ,gemini,You may need to back off a little over the next 48 hours, especially on the work front where if you come on too strong you are likely to make enemies you could do without. It’s good that you are passionate but you don’t have to be pushy.
gemini,You seem to believe that someone is trying to undermine you. It may not be true but play safe and protect yourself anyway. The most important thing, of course, is that you don’t take anything you are told as gospel. Always check “facts” for yourself.
gemini,Other people clearly have the upper hand at the moment and if you are wise you will devote at least some of your time to pleasing them. You don’t have to do everything they demand of you but show willing whenever you can.
gemini,Don’t let your anger get the better of you today or you could make a serious mistake. The planets warn that someone may be deliberately provoking you because they know how close your temper is to the surface. They want you to lose control.
gemini,The approaching lunar eclipse warns you could get a bit touchy over the next two or three days. And that bit could become a lot if you suspect that someone is trying to take away your privileged position. You may have to fight to keep it. ,gemini,If you are thinking of making changes, either at home or at work, make sure you get advice from someone you can trust before you take the first step. You may not in fact have to do anything, because the eclipse will make changes for you. ,gemini,Just because you have the power to make people do what you want them to do does not mean it is right, or even sensible. Partners and colleagues will respond much better to words of encouragement than they will to orders and demands.
gemini,A wellbeing issue of some kind needs to be dealt with. Most likely you have been burning the candle at both ends again and are feeling the effects, in which case you would be wise to listen to what your body is trying to tell you. ,gemini,The winds of fate are about to blow you in a new direction. Don’t struggle against what is happening because it will make it seem as if you are up against powers that are beyond your control. Maybe you are but they mean you no harm.
gemini,Don’t worry if you seem to be missing out on something exciting because not only will it not be as thrilling as others claim but it may actually be bad for you. The most important thing now is that you take good care of your own health. ,gemini,For too long you have kept your feelings in check but now you can and you must let them out. The results could be spectacular! The Sun’s change of sign will encourage you to believe that you can get away with anything – and maybe you can. ,gemini,Not everyone can be as quick off the mark mentally and physically as you, so make allowances and try not to make too much of a fuss if someone you live, work or do business is a bit slow at what they are doing. Cultivate a more laid-back attitude. ,gemini,Don’t let anyone tell you that what you are dreaming of cannot be done because they don’t have the first idea what they are talking about. It may be impossible for them but that does not mean it is impossible for you. Go all out for glory. ,gemini,If there is someone you have a fancy for then you must let them know about it today or during the early part of next week. There is no guarantee that they will return your affections but they will at the very least be flattered by your interest.
gemini,In recent weeks you put personal relationships on the back burner while you took care of more mundane issues, but as from today that will change. Most likely you will go right the other way and lavish your attention on one very special person.
gemini,It’s not like you to imagine you have secret enemies but for some strange reason you have been looking over your shoulder a lot of late. What have you done that might make others want to hurt you? Most likely nothing at all.
gemini,You seem to be jumping at the sight of your own shadow of late. The planets indicate there is nothing to worry about, so stop fretting. Also, stop beating yourself up about things you should have done but did not. They no longer matter.
gemini,All experience is good experience so don’t worry if something goes wrong over the next 24 hours. Where work and money matters are concerned what at first seems like a setback or a loss may in fact turn out to be the opposite. ,gemini,You are worrying about something you have no way of changing. What you need to understand is that fate will take its chosen path no matter what you may think about it, so go with the flow and trust it will turn out okay – because it will.
gemini,There will be social invitations aplenty this weekend, and that’s good because some of the people you meet are going to be useful to you, personally and professionally, between now and the end of the year. Make your popularity work for you.
gemini,Creative activities should be going well for you now and if they are not it can only be because you are not trying hard enough. Forget about everything else this week and focus on the one thing that means the most to you emotionally.
gemini,You will find yourself in a challenging situation today – and will come through with flying colors. The fact that you are quicker mentally than most of your rivals gives you a distinct advantage. You will be acting while they are still thinking. ,gemini,Your differences with a certain individual are glaringly obvious and you have no choice but to do something about them. A parting of the ways is not inevitable but if that is what you decide to do then follow through on it with no backward glances.
gemini,Sometimes it is better to back away from a fight rather than follow through and get yourself hurt and this is one of those occasions. If you do go head-to-head make sure employers and other important people are on your side! ,gemini,Keep reminding yourself that you are human and keep reminding yourself that mistakes are a fact of life – yes, even for Geminis. According to the planets you are being too hard on yourself, so ease off and find ways to enjoy life again. ,gemini,This is a positive and profitable time for you but there may be occasions when you wonder if you really deserve all the good things coming your way. All you can do is assume that fate in its wisdom knows what it is doing. ,gemini,You will have a really good idea this weekend, but you must keep it to yourself for the time being. If you let your rivals know what you are planning they may steal your idea and profit from it themselves. Don’t let that happen.
gemini,An excellent Mercury-Jupiter link during the early part of the week suggests you will meet some amazing people – and they will think you are pretty amazing as well. Get out and about as much as you can – this is no time to hide at home. ,gemini,You will take a fancy to one person today and heartily dislike someone else. The only problem is that you may get it round the wrong way and end up liking the person who is no good for you and disliking the person who is!,gemini,Anything is possible for you now that Mercury, your ruler, is energized by Jupiter, planet of expansion, but that does not mean you have to do everything. If you want to make serious progress you must focus your energy in a single direction. ,gemini,No matter how open and outgoing a Gemini you are most of the time this will be one of those days when you want to be left alone with your thoughts. You have every right to demand that others do not invade your personal space. ,gemini,There are a lot of rumors flying about the place at the moment and if you feel they are damaging your credibility you must do something about them. On the other hand, you do enjoy being in the spotlight, so maybe it’s a price worth paying. ,gemini,When the Sun changes signs a week or so from now your workload will increase, so the fewer things you have on the go now the better. If you have a bit of time on your hands today treat yourself to a break – you deserve it. ,gemini,Can you trust the advice you receive from friends and colleagues? Maybe, but is it worth taking the chance? What they tell you may in fact bear little relation to the truth, so dig in your heels if they try to force you to act.
gemini,The more you get out and about now the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Before the week is over you will have made friends with someone who shares your taste in the arts – and for exotic adventures!,gemini,Be careful what you say as the new week begins because others may cut you out of their plans if they get the impression that you are being too negative. Sometimes you can be a bit too critical for your own good. Strive to stay positive.
gemini,You often get your way through sheer force of personality but the cosmic picture warns that compromise is a must over the next few days. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your opposite sign today that should be no problem at all.
gemini,At some stage today you will rediscover the passion you had for something that for some reason went missing a short while ago. This time keep track of it and make sure it takes you all the way to success. Aim high, then go higher still.
gemini,If you are feeling more tired than usual you must take it as a warning that you have been doing too much. Something will happen today or over the weekend that reminds you that you have limits like everyone else. Respect them.
gemini,The Sun’s move into the work and wellbeing area of your chart this weekend means you would be wise to slow things down, even if you have to cut back on certain activities for a while. Speed isn’t everything, as you’ll soon find out. ,gemini,Attitude is everything. If you think that a task will be boring then most likely it will be. However, if you approach the same task with confidence and a sense of adventure you will find ways to make it fun. Life is what you choose to make it.
gemini,No matter how much certain people may question you they have no right to know about your private affairs. The planets warn that any personal information you let slip now will be used against you later on, so be careful what you say.
gemini,You may be tempted to act first and ask questions later but is that a wise choice? Play to your strengths and take plenty of time before deciding on your next course of action. If others get impatient that’s just too bad.
gemini,There will be a surge of activity in your social life today, and your love life will be a bit special too. This is also a brilliant time for artistic and creative activities. Paint a picture. Write a song. Give your imagination permission to soar. ,gemini,Don’t be put off if someone approaches you in an overly familiar or aggressive manner today – it is just their way of breaking the ice. Be a bit more adventurous in your social life Gemini – you never know where it might lead. ,gemini,Take your pleasures where you find them today. Be bold, be brave and be ready to move in a new direction at a moment’s notice. Also, be ready to deal with an upsurge in romantic feelings as love planet Venus moves through your opposite sign. ,gemini,The smallest thing is likely to set you off this weekend but losing your temper could actually be a good thing. By all means blow your top – if nothing else it will remind others that you are not the kind to be crossed.
gemini,You don’t lack for energy but are you using it in the right way? Most likely you are wasting a lot of it on issues that are not worth the effort, so be more selective in your endeavors. Make every thought, every word and every action count.
gemini,A mistake you made a long time ago will come back to haunt you today, but it’s really no big deal. If you think about it logically you will realize there is nothing much to be ashamed of. At least you tried something different.
gemini,Most of the time the world is well aware of who you are and what you can do but in recent weeks you have not been so much at the center of things. Why that is so is a matter for debate but don’t let it stay that way. Get noticed again.
gemini,Don’t leave anyone in any doubt about how you feel. Make sure those you share your life with know that you are being open and honest about your emotions, because that will encourage them to be open and honest with you as well.
gemini,You may be tempted to get angry with someone who has let you down professionally but a safer course would be to forgive and forget. Act as if nothing important has happened. To be honest it hasn’t – you are overreacting to a minor event. ,gemini,You should be looking ahead now and thinking of ways you can turn the tables on people who have given you such a hard time of late. It does not have to be anything too personal or drastic. Living well is often the best revenge. ,gemini,Take a supervising role rather than get your own hands dirty. Others will be happy to do what you ask of them, provided they feel that you value their efforts. Say the right words and push the right buttons and you won’t have to do a thing for yourself.
gemini,One of the best times of the year begins for you in just a few days when Mars enters your fellow Air sign of Aquarius. You will become a lot more adventurous over the next few weeks – yes, even more so than you are now!,gemini,You have started a lot of new things of late but there is simply no way you are going to be able to follow them all through to completion. You will have to decide this week what is worth carrying on with and what needs to be junked.
gemini,You may think highly of yourself, and with good reason, but self-regard alone won’t bring you the success you crave. In fact, if you make a silly mistake you could end up looking foolish. Be aware of your weaknesses as well as your strengths.
gemini,If you are tired of the same old faces and places then get up and get away and head somewhere new. Long-distance travel will bring opportunities to expand your mind and maybe boost your bank balance too. Learn to love your adventurous side. ,gemini,Your confidence may have taken a few knocks in recent weeks but with Mars on your side again your will to win won’t be held in check for long. Yes, those challenges were tough but adversity has a way of building character.
gemini,The obstacles ahead of you may be daunting but you have what it takes to get past them. The approaching full moon may lead to a few moments of doubt but generally speaking your confidence will soar. It could be your chance to shine.
gemini,You need to stand up to those people who seem determined to make you feel bad about yourself. You are who you are for a reason and no one has the right to demand that you change the way you look at the world.
gemini,What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so don’t dwell on the past. That, in a nutshell, is the message of the stars for you now and if you heed it you will feel the benefits. Live each day as it comes and never, ever look back. ,gemini,You will be easily influenced by what other people say and do over the next few days, which could be good but could also be bad. If you are not certain what to think or what to believe you can always refuse to make a choice.
gemini,You alone control your destiny, so don’t let other people muscle in and make decisions for you. That is going to be even more important a week or so from now when the Sun moves into your opposite sign. Fight hard to keep your independence.
gemini,You want to break free of habits and routines and modes of behavior you know are holding you back. So what’s stopping you? One big push could be all it takes to change your life for the better over the next few days. Go for it! ,gemini,You need to get to the root of a worrying issue associated with your work or your health. The Sun changes signs early next week, after which you will have more important things to worry about, so deal with it now, not later.
gemini,You appear to believe that someone who has always been friendly in the past has now turned against you. Before you say or do anything silly consider the possibility that you have simply jumped to the wrong conclusion. No one is out to get you.
gemini,No matter how good your intentions may be you must not cut corners or, worse, do something that is actually illegal. Even if you get away with it your conscience will nag at you. You’re a good guy by nature, so play by the rules. ,gemini,Don’t worry if you have not been getting along with a certain person because you will soon be friends again. You have more in common than you realize and will discover that your opinions were not nearly as far apart as you had previously believed.
gemini,The Sun’s move into the partnership area of your chart today will bring a subtle change in the way others deal with you and react to you. Hopefully it will be a change for the better but, if not, you must fight your corner.
gemini,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Sagittarius means you will be helped out by some people and let down by others. It does not matter what excuses the latter group offers, you must cut them out of your life completely.
gemini,It does not matter how many little things may have gone wrong in the past, the big things are all going right for you now, so stop worrying. Jupiter, planet of good fortune, is still very much on your side, so think lucky and be lucky.
gemini,You may not be as free to come and go as you please as you would like but it’s not the end of the world. The planets indicate that if you let others make the running now they will wear themselves out before the end of the month.
gemini,You won’t lack for courage today but you have got to make sure it is well directed. This is the perfect time to take a creative or artistic project to a much higher level. Believe in yourself and you will find it is really quite easy. ,gemini,Mercury, your ruler, is now on excellent terms with Uranus, planet of the unexpected, so there is no reason why you should not let those who love you know what you are thinking and feeling. But don’t go from one extreme to the other and say too much. ,gemini,The next few days could see the start of a new relationship but it could also take an existing relationship to a higher level. Either way, what happens around the time of the new moon on Tuesday will give your love life a much-needed boost.
gemini,If you start the week in the right frame of mind you will find it much easier to deal with what happens later on. You can make yourself happy or you can make yourself sad over the next few days – it takes the same amount of effort.
gemini,Let loved ones know how much you care for them. They know already, of course, but it never hurts to labor the point and as today’s new moon falls in the relationship area of your chart your words will go down very well indeed. ,gemini,You won’t be able to hide your thoughts and feelings from other people today, so don’t even try. Your face will betray you even when you think you are lying convincingly, so you might as well open up and let the world know your secrets. ,gemini,Resist the urge to make up your mind about something today because chances are you don’t yet have all the facts. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career where your rivals are deliberately keeping information from you. ,gemini,Your mind is full of big ideas and, yes, some of them are outrageous. Don’t let anyone tell you that you are aiming too high because Jupiter is on your side and that makes all things possible – at least for someone as adventurous as you. ,gemini,You need to get to the bottom of a situation that has been worrying you for quite some time and the good news is you are on the right track. Pluto, the planet that keeps things hidden, is about to let you in on a secret. ,gemini,With Venus, planet of harmony, moving into the sympathetic sign of Aquarius this week you can be as adventurous as you please and know that nothing bad will come of it. Forget about yesterday’s failures, it’s only tomorrow’s triumphs that count. ,gemini,You must find a way to bring some kind of romantic or domestic quarrel to an end, even if it means having to admit that you were in the wrong. This is one of those feuds that is not worth the time and energy it takes to keep going.
gemini,Keep things simple and refuse to be rushed. The more complicated you allow your life to get the more confused you will become – and that makes you an easy target for those who want to profit at your expense. Err on the side of caution.
gemini,Today’s Mars-Uranus link means you could go over the top without realizing what you are doing. What seems like perfectly acceptable behavior to you may not be acceptable to those on the receiving end, so try to see your actions through their eyes.
gemini,You will be amazingly dynamic today and tomorrow and over the weekend. Be careful though that you do not exhaust yourself. Set your sights high but don’t try to do everything at once. No matter how fit you feel you will burn yourself out.
gemini,There are good days and there are great days and this has the potential to be one of the very best. With the Sun and Jupiter on excellent terms over the next 24 hours you have nothing to worry about and everything to look forward to. Yes, really!,gemini,You will have to defend yourself quite forcefully against an attack on your reputation this weekend, but once the shouting is over you should sit down somewhere quiet and ask yourself if maybe your critics have a point. How well do you know yourself?,gemini,You will get the wrong end of the stick about something this week and end up saying or doing something you later regret. If you do make a mistake don’t make it worse by refusing to admit it. A quick apology could save a lot of grief.
gemini,No one will be immune to your charms today. Your way with words will win others over and even if they resist to begin with it is only a matter of time before they give you what you want. Affairs of the heart are especially well starred.
cancer,This should be an enjoyable time for you but if you are behind in your chores you may decide to give the fun stuff a miss and catch up on your workload. Do give yourself the occasional break though, if only to recharge your batteries.
cancer,It may be better to give than to receive but sometimes you wonder why it seems to be you who does all the giving while others do all the receiving. Never mind: within a matter of days your generosity will be rewarded.
cancer,If you change your mind about something today you will most likely have to change it back again later in the week, so stick with the decision you recently made and see it through to the end. What happened to that resolute Cancer nature?,cancer,If someone is difficult to get along with today you should make it your business to find out why. Most likely it is nothing too serious and may even be something you are able to help with. Then they’ll adore as well as respect you!,cancer,You have much to do over the next 24 hours, so start early and don’t expect to get home until late. When your head hits the pillow tonight put all the worries of the day behind you. Tomorrow will be just as trying, so get some sleep. ,cancer,You may be behind in your schedule at the moment but don’t worry about it. If anything you should be aiming to conserve your energy now, if only because by the early part of next week you will be working harder than ever.
cancer,You will encounter someone of an aggressive nature today but if you are smart you will resist the urge to hit back. With Mars moving into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart you must stay in control of your emotions.
cancer,A task you have to do may seem tiresome but once you get into it you will find it is not as tedious as you thought it would be. Having said which, get it out of the way as quickly as possible – there are still more fun things to focus on. ,cancer,Jupiter in your sign is giving you plenty of big ideas but because the planet of expansion is moving retrograde at the moment you must take care. If your ideas are too big you may over-extend yourself and cause big problems.
cancer,You don’t lack for confidence and you don’t lack for ideas but there is a danger today that you could mislead yourself about the true state of your affairs. Think positive by all means but don’t let wishful thinking take a hold on you.
cancer,Feuds and power struggles are best avoided, even if it means you have to go off and be by yourself for a while. Do not, under any circumstances, make the mistake of taking sides – in the long-term they may both turn on you.
cancer,It may be true that someone is saying awkward or embarrassing things about you but there is no reason to get paranoid and start thinking everyone is against you. Whatever you have done you are still most people’s number one.
cancer,You will get exactly what you deserve today: no more and no less. Jupiter in your sign links with Saturn in a way that guarantees you get out of life in direct proportion to what you’ve put in. And you’ve put in a lot.
cancer,Loved ones may be a bit touchy over the next 48 hours, so watch what you say and don’t be tempted to stir things up. If they really do get too miserable to bear just go some place where the vibes are more to your liking.
cancer,A full moon in the most sensitive area of your chart this week is liable to have you believing that small setbacks are of huge significance. You’ve been to this place before in your mind – do you really want to go there again?,cancer,As some of your views are a bit controversial there could be some interesting skirmishes today. But don’t make a scene if someone who disagrees with you challenges your grasp of the facts. Stay calm and prove them wrong,cancer,Do others have your best interests at heart? Maybe they do, maybe they don’t but why leave it to chance? Money matters and business issues are a minefield, so tread carefully and make sure you are not being cheated.
cancer,It may seem as if someone is trying to undermine your position, and maybe they are, but there is no need to worry about it. In a matter of days something will happen that removes them from the scene, while making you more visible.
cancer,You would be wise to be on your guard over the next 24 hours as the planets warn someone you work or do business with is being more than a little deceitful. Don’t judge others by what they say, judge them by what they do.
cancer,It seems you have come in for a bit of criticism of late and although not all of it was deserved you have to admit some of it was. The question is: have you learned from your mistakes? You should find out the answer this weekend.
cancer,You may find that everyday tasks become even more of a chore over the next few days but don’t worry. Whatever challenges you are called on to face you will handle them, if not with ease, then at least with courage and confidence.
cancer,It would be wise to take what other people say with a large pinch of salt today – most likely it is the exact opposite of what they really mean. Don’t trust anyone but yourself over the next 24 hours. You don’t need advice anyway.
cancer,Although the Sun in Capricorn brings partnership problems to the fore, Mercury in your opposite sign will make it easier for you to see things from the other person’s point of view. Make sure they see your point of view too though.
cancer,Try not to jump to conclusions today or tomorrow because most likely they will be wide of the mark. Mars and Uranus together warn that your logic circuits cannot be trusted – and your intuition may be temporarily faulty too.
cancer,Your problems are not as bad as you think, so quit worrying. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn will bring relationship matters to a head over the next few weeks, but there is no need to panic – you will survive.
cancer,This is one of the best times of the year for partnerships and for affairs of the heart in particular. With the Sun, Venus and Mercury all moving through the relationship area of your chart your charm and charisma will work wonders.
cancer,Don’t judge yourself by other people’s standards because they are simply not high enough. The planets suggest there is nothing you cannot do if you want it enough. Plant a new seed this weekend and watch it bloom in the new year.
cancer,A new moon at the very start of the year urges you to express yourself fully and emotionally, even if you are the kind of Cancerian who does not usually like to let others know how you feel. If you open up now it could prevent trouble later.
cancer,Whatever you do someone is sure to moan about it. In fact, over the next few days you will have to put up with so many petty complaints that you may want to scream. Close your ears and pretend the critics and cynics don’t exist.
cancer,Fight for your rights. Stand up for yourself and what you believe in. The only reason certain people are willing to oppose you is because you have given them the impression that you are weak. Time to set the record straight. ,cancer,Stop trying to control each and every situation you find yourself in and just let things happen. That is the message of the stars for you now and if you follow it you will be extremely happy. Others will be happy that you are not so uptight too.
cancer,Try to give loved ones a bit more freedom today and tomorrow. It’s not enough just to say that you trust them you’ve got to show it too. Besides, the more you try to control other people the more you encourage them to break away.
cancer,You may be feeling sorry for yourself at the moment, especially if you feel rejected by someone you have feelings for. Most likely you’ve got completely the wrong end of the stick, so buck up your ideas and stop being so feeble!,cancer,With Venus and Mercury nicely aligned this week you will want to be friends with everyone. You will also find it easier to make the first move in personal relationships. You have been keeping your feelings to yourself for too long.
cancer,You are about to make a hugely important decision, one that could change the course of your life. It may not be the change itself that worries you so much as how others are going to react. Don’t worry, they’ll get used to it.
cancer,You may not enjoy what happens today, not least because you have no control over events, but if you just accept it and refuse to be upset then maybe it won’t be so bad. One thing you can always control is the way you react. ,cancer,Why are you so pessimistic about your prospects? You may not have got everything you wanted in recent months but there is always tomorrow and all the days after that. You’ll feel more positive the closer you get to the weekend.
cancer,If someone whose judgment you trust urges you to really go for it today you must act immediately. Too often in the past you have been too careful and missed out – now go to the other extreme and throw caution to the wind.
cancer,Be completely honest with everyone you deal with today, even if it means you hurt their feelings in some way. If you lie to them, even with the best of intentions, they will find out later and take it as a sign you cannot be trusted.
cancer,You can quite easily wriggle out of what you are expected to do this week, but you won’t be popular and your conscience will most likely nag at you. Why not just knuckle down and get it out of the way as quickly as you can?,cancer,Even if you disagree with someone on a point of principle you can still work together, so stay on good terms and seek a compromise solution. You may not be able to have things all your own way, but if you give a little you’ll gain a lot.
cancer,Think before you act over the next 24 hours, especially if your actions are likely to affect other people. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn means what you do to others will come back to you tenfold, for better or worse.
cancer,What happens tomorrow, when the moon is full in your sign, may seem extreme but who says life is supposed to be fair? The simple fact is others have the power to make the rules and you don’t, so adapt and survive. You’ll do okay.
cancer,You may have a hard time controlling your emotions today but in a way that’s good because, as usual, you have been keeping your feelings bottled up inside. Shout and scream if you have to – and even if you don’t have to!,cancer,You can and you should make yourself known to important people over the next 24 hours. People in positions of authority will be open to your ideas and before you know it you could find yourself promoted. All you need is self-belief.
cancer,Sometimes, once you cross a line there is no going back. Bear that thought in mind today before you do something you may not be able to undo later. Remember too that what seems amusing to you could be taken seriously by other people.
cancer,You may be tempted to own up to what you have done but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. Most likely the person you are planning to confess to does not want to know about your sins. Say nothing and live with your guilt.
cancer,This is an extremely important time for money matters, so think before you act and act only in your own best interests. You will, however, have to work closely with other people. You won’t get where you want to go on your own.
cancer,Someone you do business with will put you on the spot and force you to choose between your ideals and your earnings. Just remember that if you compromise your principles once you will be expected to compromise them again and again.
cancer,Someone older and wiser will give you some excellent advice today, and if you are smart you will listen and learn. Don’t forget that there are more important things in life than material success, not the least of which is doing the right thing.
cancer,The more you say the less others will listen, so give your tongue a rest and use your eyes and ears to find out what is going on. Something you see or hear over the next 24 hours will give you something worth talking about later on.
cancer,Someone will come to you for advice about a personal matter and although you don’t want to get involved you know you can’t turn them down. But make sure they know it is only advice. The ultimate responsibility rests with them.
cancer,You may not be as forceful or as fearless as you have been of late over the weekend but that is probably no bad thing. The planets indicate it is time to slow down and stop trying to be first past the post in everything you do. For now.
cancer,A new beginning is possible but to make the most of it you are going to have to get rid of all the things you no longer need. You are carrying a lot of excess physical and emotional baggage. Now is the time to lighten your load.
cancer,Current cosmic activity makes you sensitive to changes in your environment, to the extent that you will sense when something is about to happen hours before it actually occurs. With that kind of advantage how can you possibly fail? You can’t!,cancer,Your confidence is high and you are intensely ambitious, but the planets warn that someone you think of as a friend is jealous of your success and plotting against you. Watch your back and watch what you say – don’t make it easy for them.
cancer,What you say and do now will, to a large extent, determine the level of material and professional success you will enjoy over the next few months. Don’t say and do what you think will please those in positions of power. Please yourself first.
cancer,Try to take things easy today because if you tire yourself out, physically or intellectually, it may take a while to recover. You don’t need to be as intense as you usually are. Everything will turn out for the best no matter what you do.
cancer,Some people think you are the best thing since sliced bread – and they’re right, you are. But don’t let all the flattery and adulation go to your head because there are other people who would like an excuse to take you down a peg or two.
cancer,The planets suggest that someone is about to make you an offer that is too good to be true and in your haste to be a success you might just fall for it. They say there is a sucker born every minute – make sure it’s not you.
cancer,It may seem as if you are at the mercy of events, that you are being swept along by forces over which you have no control, but is it true? Maybe you are taking too negative a view of your ability to influence events.
cancer,The most important thing over the next 24 hours is that you know when to speak up and when to stay silent. Important people will be either hugely impressed or hugely annoyed by what you have to say, so make sure you say the right thing.
cancer,Inspiration will come easy to you today, but no matter how fast your mind is working, don’t try to turn ideas into reality until later in the month. Carry a notepad — either real or electronic — with you wherever you go and keep your “To Do” list topped up. ,cancer,As Mercury turns retrograde today you should take nothing for granted. But the world should not take you for granted either. Do something completely out of character, something no one would ever expect of you. Sometimes it’s good to shock.
cancer,Whatever kind of news you receive over the next 24 hours you are advised to keep an open mind. A couple of weeks from now you will have more important issues to deal with, so don’t take what you hear now too seriously.
cancer,What seems so important to you now won’t seem so important to you from the early part of next week. It’s not so much your attitude that has changed as your values: Ideas seem more exciting than making money and gaining possessions.
cancer,Don’t worry too much if not a lot is going right for you at the moment. Later in the week the tide will turn in your favor and you will be in control of your own destiny again. You have little to fear and lots to look forward to.
cancer,The answer to your money worries will appear soon, so stay calm and don’t do anything drastic. Sacrifices will have to be made but they won’t cause you too much pain, so long as you use your head — and the talents you were born with. ,cancer,What other people don’t want you to know is exactly what you need to know right now, so start asking questions and don’t stop until you have found answers that make sense. Some of the things you discover will shock you.
cancer,Your mind may be working fast and you may have come to conclusions that satisfy you but can you be sure they are correct? Go deeper than your mind. Listen to your inner voice and act on what it tells you, even if you don’t understand it.
cancer,What looks confusing now will seem perfectly logical come the start of next week, so promise yourself that no matter what happens over the next two or three days you won’t let it worry you. That applies especially to money matters.
cancer,The planets will open your eyes to new possibilities over the next 48 hours and you won’t be slow to take advantage of them. You have all the energy and enthusiasm and self-belief you need – now all you need to do is get busy.
cancer,Try not to put yourself under unnecessary pressure as the new week begins. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will give your energy a boost but it’s not an invitation to go to extremes, either in your personal life or in your work.
cancer,Don’t waste time telling the world what you are going to do – just get on and do it and show you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Rarely have you been in such a no-nonsense mood. Rarely have your stars looked so good.
cancer,You may want to give voice to your feelings today, but is that really such a good idea? The planets warn you won’t do your cause much good if you let your resentments out for everyone to see. Act as if everything is fine — and it will be. ,cancer,The time has come to move on, with no regrets, no backward glances and no promises that if things don’t work out you can always go back again. Draw a line in the sand, step across it and embrace the new you and the new future you have planned.
cancer,Whatever activities you had lined up for the next 24 hours you may have to think again because unforeseen events will change everything. You may also have to let go of a creative or artistic idea you were attached to. It isn’t going to work.
cancer,You don’t have to ask permission to come and go. It’s your life and you are entitled to live it how you please, and if certain people are not happy with that fact then maybe it’s time to ease them out of your life. Liberty is paramount.
cancer,You are entitled to believe whatever you want to believe and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is not your friend and you must not waste time arguing with them. Make sure you use your right to think, speak and act as you see fit.
cancer,What happens over the next few days will introduce you to new ways of thinking and news ways of making sense of the world. What you discover will make you realize that a lot of what you were taught to believe was nonsense. Better late than never.
cancer,The Sun in Pisces boosts your confidence and make it easier to take chances. Not that you should push your luck at every opportunity but you do need to be a bit more adventurous. If you get the chance to travel then take it!,cancer,Even the experts get it wrong sometimes and if your hunches tell you that someone who occupies a position of power and influence does not know what they are talking about then by all means ignore them, and any advice they may give you.
cancer,You will need to close your ears to criticism today. It does not matter how good a job you do someone, somewhere will pick holes in your methods or techniques. Ignore them and carry on as before. You’re bigger and better than they are.
cancer,Be on the lookout for money-making opportunities but don’t go rushing after them the moment you spot them. As Mercury, planet of intellect and communication, turns direct again today you can afford to take your time and get it right.
cancer,Anyone who thinks you will sacrifice principles for profit has no idea what kind of person you are. You know the difference between right and wrong and you will follow the former no matter how much time and effort it takes.
cancer,Jupiter in your sign is an incredibly good influence but as the planet of expansion has been moving retrograde for some time you may not have noticed all the good things it’s been doing for you. You will begin to notice over the next few days.
cancer,Never doubt for a moment that you have what it takes to succeed. Never doubt for a moment that you belong at the top with the best. Today’s Sun-Pluto link will inspire you to believe that all things are possible. For you they are.
cancer,You seem to have made up your mind about an issue and the more others try to get you to see it in a different light the more determined you are to follow your own interpretation. That’s fine – so long as it’s the correct interpretation.
cancer,Everything is going so well for you at the moment that you may get a bit suspicious and wonder if it’s some kind of cosmic trick. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a genuine lucky streak, so make sure you enjoy it.
cancer,You have been a bit to cautious of late but now that Jupiter is moving in your favor again you will find the confidence to take a few risks. If you have not done it already you should be planning your next big adventure. In fact, make it huge.
cancer,The journey you have started on may be long and hard but you are determined to reach the end, and with Jupiter on your side again there is no doubt you will succeed. Do you believe that? You should. Self-belief is half the battle.
cancer,You have every right to express your opinions, even if – especially if – your opinions offend people in positions of power. Just because they are so high and mighty does not mean they are right. Free speech is sacrosanct, regardless of “facts”.
cancer,This is not the time to dwell on mistakes. The Sun in Pisces boosts your confidence and encourages you to aspire to new heights, both personally and professionally, so put the past behind you and make the coming week a huge success.
cancer,This can be and should be one of the most productive times of the year. The harder you work at making your dreams come true the quicker you will reach the goals you have set yourself – and then you can set yourself a few more.
cancer,The more others say you can trust them today the more cautious you should be. In any and all kinds of negotiations you must – repeat, must – get promises in writing at every stage. If you don’t, they will most likely turn out to be worthless.
cancer,There is no point dwelling on past mistakes. If you recently did something wrong then learn from it what you can, then put it behind you and move on. You’ll make mistakes tomorrow too, of course, but your successes will far outnumber them.
cancer,Speak up and let the world know what you are thinking. Some very important people will be listening to what you have to say today and if they like what they hear it won’t be long before the offers start coming in. It pays to be ambitious.
cancer,You won’t want to stay in one place or with one group of people over the next 48 hours. It does not matter what chores and duties need to be done, leave them until you are more in the mood. Be free to come and go as you please.
cancer,You will find plenty to be optimistic about over the next few days and when the Sun crosses the career angle of your chart on Thursday the ambitious side of your nature will come to the fore too. You’re going places – and fast.
cancer,Believe it or not there is a reason for everything that happens in life and that fact won’t change just because you can’t work out what it might be. Your task today, and for the coming week, is to trust in the universe, and in yourself.
cancer,Listen to what your conscience tells you today and ignore anyone who gives you conflicting advice. Too much of what others say is based on fear and ignorance and wishful thinking and is therefore of no lasting value. Listen to your heart.
cancer,Important people are watching you closely, so make sure they like what they see. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart tomorrow will energize you and make you more ambitious than usual. Let the world know what you can do.
cancer,If you want to move up in the world then now is the time to get yourself noticed. It does not matter how much talent you have, what truly matters is that you have a clear goal in mind and that you go after it with everything you’ve got.
cancer,The most important thing today is that you make sure the facts and figures support your point of view. If you make claims, either socially or at work, that others find easy to show are false it won’t do your reputation a lot of good.
cancer,If you are serious about changing habits and routines that have outlived their usefulness you could not pick a better time to start. It’s not only old habits that could be on the way out – you may decide to change your whole way of life.
cancer,You are always ready with a helping hand but an overly generous approach may not work in your favour over the next seven days. Just this once maybe you should ask yourself if others deserve to have you looking out for them.
cancer,You will be able to twist people around your little finger today – no one will be immune to your charms. Is it right to use your talents in this way? Of course it is. All is fair in love, war and getting ahead in your career.
cancer,You need to understand that not everyone thinks and feels the same way as you. You may not be able to see things from another person’s point of view but you do have to recognize that they have a point of view – and that it’s valid.

cancer,Others can sense your self-confidence and because of that they want to do things for you – and who are you to refuse any offers? It will certainly give you more time to work on a creative project that should be finished very soon.

Don’t worry, they don’t expect you to get it “right”, they just want to see if you panic. ,cancer,If there is a creative or artistic project you have been struggling to finish the next four or five days will be critical. Either give it your all and get it done or give up on it altogether and move on to something new.
cancer,If someone you have feelings for seems unresponsive today don’t think it means you are drifting apart. Most likely they just need to spend some time by themselves for a while to think things through. Give them the space they need.
cancer,If you need to make a decision concerning your career wait until the end of the week. The planets warn if you make it today you could end up moving in completely the wring direction. What’s the hurry? Take your time and get it right.

cancer,Certain people may try to make you feel bad by pointing out your shortcomings but no one is perfect, not even you, and the fact that you got something wrong is merely evidence that you tried to do something – when so few do.

cancer,You may want to help those less fortunate than you but think twice before volunteering for a task you know very little about. Others may be impressed by your enthusiasm but they won’t be so impressed if you make a mess of the job.

cancer,Your confidence is high at the moment and will rise even higher over the next few days. Friendships and group activities are under excellent stars, so get out into the world and see and be seen. Your positive attitude is an inspiration.

cancer,It seems you are on some sort of personal crusade. If your cause is worth fighting for – and it is – you should have no trouble at all attracting the support of friends and family and colleagues, but don’t be too pushy about it.
cancer,Keep things simple over the next 24 hours and you won’t go far wrong. You know what it is that you want, you know where it is you can find it and there is nothing anyone can do to deny you your heart’s desire. It’s all good.
cancer,Something you have been worrying about for ages won’t bother you any more. Most likely that is because you are starting to focus on issues that really matter rather than issues that, in the greater scheme of things, are of no importance at all.
cancer,It’s not easy being a role model but if anyone can do it you can. Be on your best behavior today and take pride in knowing that others think you are worth following. Set a good example and only do what is inspiring and uplifting.
cancer,There is a danger that you will try to make the facts fit your assumptions – and if you do the consequences could be dire. Always strive to see life as it is, not as you wish it might be. Then and only then can you make a difference.
cancer,It seems you have been taking one particular friendship a bit too much for granted and if you let the situation carry on this way you may drift too far apart to ever get back together again. Give them a call and meet up for a night out.
cancer,You can easily make a good impression with your employer or others in positions of authority this weekend. Don’t forget though: just because you know what you are capable of does not mean everyone else knows. Spell it out for them.

This person has done so much for you in the past, so help willingly, not grudgingly.
cancer,The things you fear the most are the things from which you have least to fear. Keep repeating that fact to yourself because you need it to seep into your subconscious. The planets indicate that nothing out there in the world can possibly hurt you.
cancer,No matter what happened and who was to blame there is no point regretting what happened yesterday because you cannot go back and change it. What you can do, of course, is to make tomorrow better. Make that your aim.
cancer,What you hear today may annoy you but is it worth getting worked up about? Of course not. If you allow yourself to get angry by what other people say about you they will have succeeded in their aim. It’s only words after all.
cancer,Do what you want to do rather than what other people expect you to do. Having said that, you will gain more in the long-term if, at least some of the time, you join forces with like-minded people. Your goals and their goals are similar.
cancer,Trust your instincts and keep on trusting them even when the powers that be say you’ve got it all wrong. Listen to what your inner voice is trying to say and then act on what it tells you. You don’t need any other advice.

cancer,Mind planet Mercury in the most introspective area of your chart means you are more concerned with what is going on in your own head than what is taking place in the wider world. Good. The more you think the better you’ll do.
cancer,It is even more important than usual this weekend that you think in a positive way – and feel positive too. Whatever imaginings you allow into your mind they will quickly become your new reality, so you must avoid negative thinking.
cancer,You are a sensitive person by nature and with the Sun joining mind planet Mercury in the most receptive area of your chart this week even minor setbacks could send you into a tailspin. Try to keep a sense of perspective – and laugh often.
cancer,You may think you are doing great but beware: too much self-regard could be a dangerous thing. The planets warn that if you are too full of yourself today you could make a silly mistake and end up looking rather foolish.
cancer,You don’t have to be number one all of the time, even though as a cardinal sign you are used to being one of life’s leaders. If you want to get ahead this week you must look for compromise solutions. They’re easy enough to find.
cancer,Now that the Sun is moving into the most receptive area of your chart you will find it easier to deal with the sensitive side of your nature. For one thing you won’t have to pretend that you never need a shoulder to cry on.

cancer,This is an important time for you because what you decide over the next few weeks, and especially over the next few days, will form the basis of your reality for the coming year. Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts.
cancer,Because today’s new moon falls in the most sensitive area of your chart perhaps your best course of action over the next 48 hours is to withdraw from the world for a bit. Start planning for the coming 12 months – they’re sure to be special.
cancer,Social activities are under excellent stars today and the best way to unwind and relax is to seek out people who think and act is similar ways to you. If you are looking for love you could find it with someone who shares your cultural interests.

cancer,There is a danger that you will believe the powers that be have got it in for you. Nothing could be further from the truth. Your only real enemy at the moment is your overactive imagination, so stop thinking so hard!,cancer,You won’t have to try too hard to make an impression today.

cancer,You have been holding on to a habit or routine that has been outdated for quite some time – in fact it has been holding you back. Now is the time to get rid of it once and for all. Replace it with something more up to date.
cancer,You don’t care in the slightest what other people think of you or of your methods. Having said that, you do need to listen to advice today – if you don’t you could make the kind of mistake that takes a lot of time and money to put right.

cancer,Something that once seemed beyond you is now very much within reach and you can easily make it your own over the next 24 hours. Once you’ve got it, don’t hold it too tightly. Too much possessiveness is rarely a good thing.
cancer,A friend will offer you some excellent advice but because it is not what you were hoping to hear you may ignore it. Almost certainly tomorrow’s full moon will make sure you regret it, so don’t let your ego get in the way of the facts.
cancer,If you allow yourself to be talked into doing something you don’t really want to do today you will regret it for weeks, maybe even months, to come. There is no easy way to tell people that you can’t help them out. Just say “no”.
cancer,There is a danger that you could try to force others to do what you think is best for them, even though they clearly don’t want to do it. Even if you succeed in the short-term you could cause bad feelings that will hold you back in the long-term.

cancer,Do you have a clear idea of what your long-term ambitions are going to be? If not you would be wise to get your thoughts in order over the next few days. You must be realistic about your plans – vague daydreams won’t come true.
cancer,If you change something that does not appear to be working today chances are you will regret it come the weekend when the Sun moves into your birth sign. You really don’t need to change a thing – everything is fine as it is.

As the Sun moves into your sign today one of the very best times of the year get under way.

Each day can be a new beginning, so forget about yesterday and the day before and focus on the here and now. Excellence is the next five minutes.
cancer,Give yourself permission to dream and give yourself permission to believe you can do amazing things with your life. Also, make sure everyone knows what your special dream is, because there will be people you meet along the way who can help you.
cancer,Refuse to take no for an answer, both in your personal life and in your career. If you demand to be taken seriously there is no doubt at all you will accomplish great things over the coming year. Don’t be a “nice guy” – be the one who makes things happen.
cancer,There may be times over the next 24 hours when it feels as if you are the only one who does not know what is going on, but is that such a bad thing? Being out of the loop could actually work in your favor today.
cancer,There will be times over the coming year when the emotional part of your nature dominates the logical part of your nature. Try to get them working together: let your heart guide you to begin with, then switch to rational mode when making things happen.

cancer,Close your ears to criticism and let your heart lead you. The more others tell you that you are on the wrong course, that you should turn back, the more you should keep to the path you are on. Listen to your inner voice, always.
cancer,As your ruling planet Mercury moves in your favor on your birthday this year you will move at lightning speed in both mind and body. It’s as if you are making up for all those times when you held back for some reason. Give it everything you’ve got.
cancer,For best results today don’t limit yourself to tried and trusted ways of doing things. Use your imagination to dream up new ideas and new ways of living, laughing and loving. Ultimately, your outer reality is created by the inner you.
cancer,Don’t expect everything to run smoothly or go according to plan today. It may well be that a colleague is jealous of your success and will say things that are designed to undermine you, but there is no need to take them seriously.
cancer,Don’t worry if you upset someone today because the planets indicate you need to let others know you won’t be pushed around. It may mean the end of a friendship but that’s a small price to pay for securing your freedom.
cancer,If someone has let you down or betrayed your trust then say what has to be said and do what has to be done, then put it behind you and move on. It may not be easy to forgive and forget but in the long-term it’s by far the best policy.
cancer,Act in haste now and you will almost certainly regret it later. Despite what others may tell you there is no need to rush. On the contrary, you will accomplish more if you let things happen rather than try to make them happen yourself.
cancer,If you let your fears get the better of you today you will regret it later when you realize what a great opportunity you have allowed to pass by. If you see an opening, go through it. It might be the chance you have been waiting for.

cancer,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign means you need to take a more even-handed approach to partnership matters. The most important thing to learn is that success depends on co-operation. No, you really can’t do it all on your own.
cancer,Partnerships and relationships will be immensely important to you over the next 12 months. They are more likely to run smoothly if you don’t try to turn each and every encounter into a trial of strength. Life should be about cooperation, not competition.
cancer,The more you help other people the more you will help yourself. That has always been true but over the coming 12 months it will become obvious on a much higher level that your fate is bound up with the fates of those around you. Strive to do good.
cancer,The coming year will be hugely busy and there is a danger that you might reach too high or push too hard. Having said that, life is supposed to be an adventure, so why shouldn’t you raise your sights ever higher? Life is what you choose to make of it.
cancer,You know what needs to be done now all you have to do is do it. Of course, being a shy Cancer, you can be indecisive, but deep down you know that if you don’t act now a golden opportunity will pass you by.
cancer,If you go out of your way to help people in need your good deeds will come back to you many times over. If, however, you go out of your way to make life difficult for others your own life will be more difficult than necessary.
cancer,You will be attracted to people who are different, who are mavericks, who don’t play by the rules. There is a lot you can learn from them but don’t forget you are a Cancerian and conservative by nature. To be happy you must be true to yourself.
cancer,Some of the things you do over the coming 12 months will leave people shaking their heads in disbelief – and that’s good. You have been far too predictable for far too long and it’s time to shake things up a bit. Don’t aim to be average, aim to be awesome.
cancer,Neptune and Mercury combine on your birthday to endow you with the kind of creative and imaginative powers that can change your life, and maybe the world too. But don’t get impatient and expect everything to happen at once. Genius needs time.

cancer,The most important thing over the coming year is that you make the effort to see life as it is rather than as how you imagine or wish it to be. Only then will you be able to make serious progress, helping both yourself and other people do more and do better.
cancer,The focus of your life is about to change quite dramatically but that’s no bad thing. One thing that is certain to change is your money situation which, you would be the first to admit, needs sorting out. No more spending sprees!,cancer,Look ahead to where you would like to be a month or even a year from now and start doing the things that can make it happen. The more you focus on the direction you want your life to take the more likely it is to come about.
cancer,The best way to deal with your current problem is to not deal with it at all. Just leave it alone. Let it be. You may want to take charge and put the world to rights but the planets say that isn’t going to happen, so relax.

cancer,A new moon in the financial area of your chart means there will be changes in your money situation. Whether they are good changes or bad changes remains to be seen but in the long-term you should gain more than you lose.
cancer,What is right for you may be wrong for other people and if you keep that fact in mind this week you won’t go far wrong. More to the point, you won’t waste your precious time and energy trying to convert people to your point of view.
cancer,The planets are trying to warn you that if you don’t make an effort to slow down you could end up crashing into an obstacle that has no give at all. Even a Cancerian needs to accept that they are not immune to failure, or pain.
cancer,You need to leave behind the hustle and bustle and find yourself a place where you can be alone with your thoughts. The more you contemplate the meaning of life over the next few days the more life will bless you later in the year.
cancer,You need to do something about your cash flow situation but you need to make sure it is the kind of something that does not risk everything. Is your position really so desperate? Or have you convinced yourself that things are worse than they are?,cancer,Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have not yet reached the heights you were aiming for. There is no time limit by which you have to be rich, famous or whatever else it is you think you should be. Besides, you always get another chance.

cancer,You are under no obligation to be nice to people you don’t much like but if they are people whose assistance you might need in the near future it would be a wise move to stay in their good books, at least for the time being.
cancer,Your mind will expand in understanding and you will know in a flash what it is you have to do. After that it is up to you: you can accept the challenge and be special, or you can reject it and be mediocre like so many others.
cancer,The approaching full moon warns that if you carry on spending money at the present rate you will soon be out of cash. Maybe it’s time to be honest with yourself about how wasteful you have been lately – and why you have been so weak.
cancer,Sometimes you lack self-belief but the danger today is that you will go right the other way and try to prove yourself by undertaking a task that is clearly too much for you. Get the balance right: only do what you feel comfortable with.
cancer,Money may not be everything but it has its place in the world and with a little bit more of it you would be able to do some of the things you have often dreamed about. It’s time to start using your talents in a more focused way.
cancer,A craving of some sort will reach a peak and if you want peace of mind you will have to acknowledge your desires and do what you can to satisfy them. It’s really no big deal – everyone needs something to make them feel good.
cancer,It may be your style to avoid confrontation but something needs to be brought into the open where it can be discussed. Face up to what has come between you and a friend or lover or relative and find a way to deal with it.
cancer,It should be obvious by now that a friend or family member needs your assistance – so what are you waiting for? You know from your own experience how difficult it can be to ask for a helping hand, so make the first move.
cancer,So what if something has not worked out the way you expected? That’s life. You cannot have things your own way all of the time but you will always get another chance, so why worry? Look forward today, not back.
cancer,You may lose your temper today with someone who lets you down or disrupts your schedule – and they deserve it. Don’t feel guilty if you go over the top a bit because, sadly, that seems to be the only language they understand.
cancer,Mars and Pluto will combine over the next 48 hours to give your ego and energy a much-needed boost. You won’t lack for self-belief, so much so that you honestly believe all things are possible. Aim high, then go even higher.
cancer,You can’t seem to make up your mind which direction you should be moving, which is of course frustrating, but who says you have to make a decision? Maybe the planets are trying to tell you to sit tight and wait for a sign.
cancer,Keep your money in your pocket this weekend, because if you make one wrong move you will have to make several more moves to get back to where you were at the beginning, and that’s a serious waste of time and energy.
cancer,You may be reluctant to let loved ones know what is upsetting you but until you do no one will be able to help you. Everyone needs assistance once in a while, even a Cancer, so let those who care for you know what’s going on.
cancer,You need to get routine matters out of the way as early as possible, because the second half of the day will bring some lovely surprises. If a social invitation arrives out of the blue you must take it – it could change your life.
cancer,There is no point being careful all of the time but, on the other hand, if you go too far you may regret it. If a loved one warns you are sailing too close to the edge you should take heed and rein yourself in a bit.
cancer,There are times when you need to spend some time alone and such a time is now. You have a lot to think about and you can’t think straight with so much noise going on around you. Find a quiet space you can call your own.
cancer,The Sun’s change of signs at the weekend will get your mind moving a bit faster and maybe expand your vision as well. You will certainly begin to see the good things you somehow missed over the past few weeks. There’s plenty of them.
cancer,You know there are no shortcuts to success but with Mars, planet of action, moving in your favor now you have what it takes to reach the top. Make an extra special effort over the next few days. It will be worth it.
cancer,Your money worries should decrease a bit now but that does not mean you can forget about making changes. On the contrary, they are more necessary than ever, not least because you’ll get more social invitations – and that means more expense.
cancer,The pace of life will speed up quite dramatically over the next few days, so pace yourself sensibly and don’t get so caught up in the whirl of social activities that you leave precious little time for anything else. Focus on what matters.
cancer,Your way with words will help you out of a tight corner today. Just because it was fairly easy to talk your way out of trouble this time does not mean it will be so easy again. Next time, try not to be so provocative!,cancer,With Mars, planet of ego, moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you could not care less what other people think. If something appeals to your sense of adventure today you will go for it no matter what others say.
cancer,Some people just rub you up the wrong way and you will have to deal with at least one, and maybe several, such persons today. The important thing is that you realize you cannot change them – no more than they can change you.
cancer,If you get a bit snappy with the people around you today that’s a clear sign you need to let off steam. The best way to do that is to get physical. It doesn’t have to be excessive but it does have to get your heart pumping.
cancer,Your self-belief is a bit fragile at the moment and whatever the reason for that – and most likely there is no reason at all – you will turn the corner over the next few days and soon you’ll be smiling again. Worry is a useless emotion. ,cancer,Any sacrifices you have to make today will come easy to you – and make a huge difference to people you care for. You will get the most satisfaction though from showing a loved one how to better take care of themselves.
cancer,Don’t be tempted to take on too much work today because if you do your standards may have to be lowered. No matter how much others may offer you to do more you must be strong and resist the temptation. It’s not just about money.
cancer,Today’s positive cosmic influences will smooth your path and make it easy for you to get from A to B with a minimum of fuss. Travel and social activities will go very well for you over the next few days. Having fun is what it’s all about.
cancer,Sit back, stop worrying and enjoy the ride. That is the message of the stars for you today and if you are smart you will heed it. Looking back you will realize you got worked up about certain issues for no good reason.
cancer,The planets will bring you into conflict this weekend with someone you usually get along with. Everything will be okay if you resolve to get past it quickly. Don’t let bad feelings linger. You have too much to do to waste time on petty vendettas.
cancer,Honesty is the best policy this weekend, especially if you are trying to help a friend or family member in some way. You won’t help them in the slightest if you tell a white lie just to make them feel better. Say what has to be said.
cancer,This week’s cosmic influences will bring you into contact with a wider range of people than usual and there will be no end of chances to put your point of view across about issues that are important to you. Just don’t be too pushy about it.
cancer,A problem that has been annoying you for weeks, maybe even months, can easily be resolved, provided you are willing to listen to advice. Sometimes it is easier for an outsider to point out our mistakes, no matter how embarrassing that might be.
cancer,Just because you failed at something does not mean you are a failure. The planets indicate that though you may have failed at one thing in recent weeks you have learned enough to make sure that next time you will succeed. Go for it.
cancer,If you have doubts about a project others are trying to get you involved in then by all means steer clear of it. Whatever they may say to the contrary there is something about it that does not feel right. Always trust your instincts.
cancer,This is generally a positive time for you but don’t take too much on trust or you may miss out on a golden opportunity. If you neglect something today it could come back to haunt you in the not too distant future.
cancer,This should be a day to remember for all the right reasons. New friendships will be made with ease and existing relationships will improve dramatically. The more you open up to others the more they will open up to you.
cancer,On the surface you appear calm but deep down your emotions are raging – and with good reason considering what you’ve had to put up with. Sooner or later you will have to make a stand against your critics. Make it sooner, like right now.
cancer,You may be bored with your present routine and desperate to break out of a rut but you also know you stand to lose quite a lot if you make the wrong choice about what you do next. Don’t be hasty, something good will come up very soon.
cancer,According to the planets you should follow a course you have navigated profitably before rather than set out in a new direction. Despite what some people may say to the contrary there is no need for any type of major change.
cancer,If what you previously thought was a brilliant idea has come to nothing, abandon it. You may be tempted to give it another go but is it worth it? Probably not. There are more interesting things you can spend your time on today.
cancer,Because recent months have been hectic for you there were a number of things you wanted to do but never quite got round to. Now you can begin to move in a more agreeable direction. Focus only on what brings a smile to your face.
cancer,Be careful that something you say to a loved one does not hurt them emotionally, Yes, of course, you have every right to express your opinion, but you also have a responsibility to think about what the consequences might be.
cancer,There will always be good days and bad days but there will be a lot more of the former if you change the way you assess what is “good” and what is “bad”. You can be far too hard on yourself at times. Laugh more.
cancer,You will find yourself attracted to someone whose outlook on life is very different to your own. If you begin a relationship will it work? Maybe, maybe not, but you won’t know until you try, so make this the weekend when you start finding out.
cancer,It will take more than logic and good sense to change a colleague’s mind about something this week – they are clearly determined not to budge. Why is that do you suppose? Could it be they know something you don’t? Find out.
cancer,You are torn between doing something you enjoy but which won’t bring much in the way of financial success, and doing something you don’t enjoy which could be profitable. You know the answer already: be true to your instincts – go for enjoyment.
cancer,Life could be a bit of a battlefield today. A lot depends on how you deal with your emotions, especially when people whose way of doing things you despise insist that you follow their example. Your principles may not allow you to do that.
cancer,A change of direction of some kind will be forced on you over the next few weeks and if you are smart you won’t try to fight it. You can sense that better times lie just ahead, but first you will need to give up your old ways.
cancer,The choices you make over the next few days will have a major impact on your social or professional reputation, so make them wisely. Above all don’t let other people rush you into cutting corners or cutting back on essentials. Do it right.
cancer,Take advantage of the Sun moving through Libra – one of the more laidback signs of the Zodiac – to sit back and relax. If you have not got something done by now chances are it will never see the light of day, so forget it.
cancer,Try to steer clear of other people’s problems over the next 48 hours, especially those of an emotional kind. Sometimes it is kinder to let those you love learn from their own mistakes, and this appears to be one of those occasions.
cancer,No doubt there is a valid reason why you feel you need to go on the attack, but make sure you pick the right fights over the next few days. Also, try not to annoy people it is in your interests to stay on good terms with.
cancer,You seem impatient to get rid of something that has been a central part of your life for years. Is that such a good idea? It may appear to have outlived its usefulness but the planets indicate there is something important it can still do for you.
cancer,You need to think deeply about important matters today but you also need to keep whatever conclusions you reach to yourself, at least for the time being. The breakthrough you desire will happen in its own good time – you don’t need to push it.
cancer,This may be an emotional time in your life but there are people who love you and are always there for you and if you are smart youwill call on them today. Not only will they ease your fears but they will make you laugh as well.
cancer,A positive attitude in the face of adversity is often enough to turn the tide, so look on the bright side today and don’t worry about tomorrow. The surge of confidence you feel should be enough to see you through this difficult phase.
cancer,You will find yourself attracted to an idea that is, to say the least, a little bit unusual over the next 24 hours. That’s okay. Even people as traditional as you have moments when their minds leap to a higher level. This could be one of them.
cancer,If you are convinced that a certain course of action is correct then go ahead and do it. Of course, deep down you may not be as convinced as you claim to be, but your Leo flair will see you through – it always does.
cancer,You may have to cause a bit of a scene over the next few days, especially if people expect you to do things you feel uncomfortable with. Far from damaging your reputation your assertiveness will be noted and admired. But don’t push it too far.
cancer,Emotions will run deep over the next few days, both your own and other people’s, so don’t be surprised if there are a few tears. But don’t take them too seriously either. In the greater scheme of things nothing of substance is likely to change.
cancer,Have faith in what your instincts tell you, even when the so-called experts tell you something completely different. What happens over the next few days will prove you right in every way, so stick to your guns – you’ll get the last laugh.
cancer,Don’t be fooled if a rival suddenly appears to give in over something you have been arguing about for weeks. Yes, it’s possible they are sincere but the lunar eclipse suggests otherwise. It will pay you to be suspicious over the next 24 hours.
cancer,You will learn as much from your mistakes today as you do from your successes, so be of good cheer and expect an upturn in your fortunes very soon. Not even a Cancer can get it right each and every time, but you get it right more than most.
cancer,It’s important that you are honest with yourself about the position you are in but you also need to be more optimistic. The fact is your financial situation is nowhere near as bleak as you have been painting it – and a solution is very close at hand.
cancer,A work or career difficulty you encounter this weekend can only be resolved if you approach it from an unusual angle. Whatever else happens don’t lose your temper because that will signal to rivals that they’ve got you on the run.
cancer,You can sense that something important is about to happen, something that will turn your world upside down. There is no reason to feel apprehensive – the planets suggest that whatever changes come about you will benefit in remarkable ways. ,cancer,You must not be careless today. You must maintain 100 per cent concentration in what you are doing, even if you think you know all the moves by heart. Neptune’s deceptive influence could easily trip you up over the next 24 hours.
cancer,The best way to solve a relationship issue is not to issue ultimatums but to show a genuine interest in why the object of your affection seems so negative at the moment. Maybe it was something you said. Maybe you just need to un-say it.
cancer,Why have you been singled out for so much good fortune? Who knows. Who cares. The fact is that both at home and at work others are going out of their way to make life fun for you. Go out of your way to enjoy it.
cancer,You need to be more flexible when it comes to emotional relationships. With so much cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart loved ones may be difficult to handle but will respond favorably if you approach them with gentle understanding.
cancer,You may not be looking forward to a social event of some kind but the planets indicate if you make the effort to enjoy yourself you will be surprised how much fun you have. Go on, get up and dance – you know you want to.
cancer,It does not matter in the slightest what others think about you and what you are doing. If they want to be critical, that’s up to them but you don’t have to listen, or care. Be who you want to be and do what you want to do.
cancer,You are in a practical frame of mind at the moment and that’s good because there are a number of everyday issues that need to be dealt with. Focus especially on money matters over the next 24 hours and remember: cash is king.
cancer,Pluto in your opposite sign of Capricorn may seem to be undermining friendships and relationships but what it is really doing is testing how strong they are. What happens over the remainder of the week will make clear who you can trust, and love.
cancer,So many things in your life need to change and tomorrow’s eclipse means this is the time to gets serious about them. Creatively and romantically you need to identify your highest ideals and accept nothing less than perfection.
cancer,No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been – and there were times when you could have screamed – what comes next will restore your faith in yourself, if not yet the whole of humanity. Today’s solar eclipse will in some way delight you.
cancer,It’s not often you need to be told to keep your feet on the ground but with so much fantastic cosmic activity taking place it will be easy to get carried away. Enjoy the good things that come your way, but never take them for granted.
cancer,As from this weekend relationships will become easier to handle, not least because you are no longer prepared to put up with certain people’s negative behavior. There are times when you need to get tough and this is one of them.
cancer,As a cardinal sign you like to make quick decisions and you would prefer to make a wrong choice than no choice at all. But not everyone is like you and you may feel a bit frustrated today with someone who just can’t get their act together.
cancer,If you measure success in terms of winning and losing then, inevitably, you will never be truly satisfied. Real success means being a better person today than you were yesterday or the day before. Make that your yardstick this coming week.
cancer,The most important thing now is that you simply refuse to settle for the same old way of doing things. Something you see or hear will stimulate your imagination and make you realize there are many ways you can make life more interesting.
cancer,According to the planets you want to do one thing but your subconscious mind says you should be doing something else. What you end up doing is actually of secondary importance. What matters is that you do something – right now.
cancer,If you try to limit someone’s freedom today you could find it rebounds on you. Better by far to give them the space they require and the encouragement they crave. It’s unlikely they will wander too far without your approval.
cancer,What you think is important and what really is important may be easily confused over the next 48 hours, so keep things simple. If you let your mind wander your life could get a lot more complicated than it needs to be.
cancer,You may be eager to push ahead with a plan of some sort but you won’t get far if you try to go at it alone. Take your time, make alliances and do it right. Thursday’s full moon should remove any obstacles still in your path.
cancer,You won’t lack for confidence today but common sense may be harder to come by. Make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for before agreeing to part with cash or support a creative project that is under other people’s control. ,cancer,A creative or romantic problem may seem to have no logical answer but only because you are looking at it from a negative angle. Raise your sights and it will quickly become apparent what needs to be done. Then you must do it.
cancer,Be sensible and stick within your natural limits. It may be tempting to go beyond what you know you are capable of but the planets warn your calculations could easily be wrong – and that could be costly in more ways than one. ,cancer,Be a bit outrageous today. Do something that is guaranteed to shock those who see you as the kind of person who never makes waves. Too many people have been taking you for granted of late. Time to shake them up a bit.
cancer,If your feelings for a particular individual are not as positive as they appear to believe you will do more harm than good pretending that they are. Honesty is essential today and over the weekend, especially in affairs of the heart.
cancer,Be generous with someone who isn’t always so generous to you. It will do you good to treat this person well no matter what problems they may have caused you in the past. Forgiveness cures all ills both real and imagined.
cancer,Today’s Mars-Pluto link in your opposite sign of Capricorn could create a false sense of urgency – you feel if you don’t take action immediately you will miss your chance. That simply isn’t true. Take your time and make your next move the right move.
cancer,Your instincts may tell you that what you are planning to do will be unpopular with certain people but that is a pretty good reason for doing it. You don’t care about being popular, you care only about being right.  ,cancer,Are you happy with who you are and what you are doing with your life? If so, why are you so concerned what other people think about you? You don’t have to conform to a certain way of living simply because you think it is expected of you.
cancer,You can quite easily patch up a relationship which, for one reason or another, has turned sour in recent weeks. Make the first approach and you will be heartened to learn that a loved one is as eager to kiss and make up as you.
cancer,If you approach a work or relationship problem from a predictable angle then you will get a predictable answer. But if you creep up on it you may discover something you had not noticed before – that it’s not really a problem at all.
cancer,Try to see things from a loved one’s point of view before criticizing what they are doing. Different people have different needs and different aspirations, so focus on your own desires this weekend and try not to be so judgmental. ,cancer,Be honest about what you desire, even if there is little chance of getting it. Some things take time to develop and you certainly won’t change other people’s attitudes overnight, but you can put down a marker for the future.
cancer,Don’t waste time wishing you were somewhere else or doing something else. The fact is you are exactly where you need to be and you are doing exactly what you are supposed to be doing. So do it some more, only better than before. ,cancer,A little of what you fancy will do you good today, but don’t go overboard and consume too much or you could make yourself sick. This will be a lively and progressive day but you must strike the right balance between giving and taking. ,cancer,If you are not 100 per cent certain what you want out of life at this particular moment in time, you will be come the start of next week. Over the next 48 hours your head and your heart will be in perfect harmony. Be amazing.
cancer,Your attitude to certain issues has changed so much in recent months and today’s new moon will cause you to question even more of what you believe. That’s good. The more you change the happier you will be in the long-term. ,cancer,You may find it hard to disguise your feelings but why should you want to when they are so loving? Showing you care is not a sign of weakness but of strength – and loved ones need to know you are strong enough to protect them.
cancer,You have been pushing yourself hard of late and if you start this week the way you finished the last one it won’t be long before you break down in some way. The only pressure you are under is the pressure you put on yourself.  ,cancer,Jupiter, planet of expansion, links with Mars today, urging you to rise above the limits you have imposed on yourself. You can and you will accomplish things over the next few weeks that you had previously only dreamed of doing.
cancer,You need to find a solution to either a money matter or a relationship issue. The way out of your predicament is obvious really but it will also be costly. Either you act now and pay now or pay an even larger penalty later.
cancer,You must act immediately on what your instincts are telling you. It does not matter if everyone else seems to be moving in the opposite direction, it matters only that you trust what your inner voice tells you – don’t doubt it.
cancer,Just because one thing you tried went wrong does not mean you are a failure and anyone who says you are is not a friend and must be cut from your life right away. You will always get another chance, and another after that.
cancer,There may be moments this weekend when you regret making a commitment of some kind but the fact is you signed up and now you must see it through to the end. Whether you enjoy it or hate it depends largely on the attitude you choose to adopt.
cancer,Because you are so immersed in everyday matters you don’t seem to realize just how fortunate you are. Take time out of your busy schedule to stand back from trivial issues and see the bigger picture. Your place in that picture is about to get bigger.
cancer,Something you have long taken for granted now turns out to be not so simple after all. Rather than be annoyed, be inquisitive and dig a little deeper into the situation – what you find could send you on a voyage of discovery. ,cancer,You will be called upon to make a daring decision, a decision that only you can hope to get away with. You have a wealth of good ideas but do you have the drive and the determination to do something with them? Of course you do. ,cancer,You may not feel entirely at home with a certain group of people but what you learn from them today will make other areas of your life so much easier to deal with. You are about to gain a new perspective on an old problem.
cancer,There is only one thing worse than allowing yourself to be anxious about a money matter and that is going right the other way and pretending there is nothing wrong at all. A sensible balance is needed if you are to find a lasting solution.
cancer,You seem to be on the defensive at the moment and that’s probably no bad thing. Most likely no one is out to get you but it will pay you to be cautious anyway. Your instincts could be trying to tell you something.
cancer,Don’t let doubt creep in this weekend or it will quickly take control. A full moon in the most sensitive area of your chart makes you easily upset by criticism, so resolve right now to let none of it through your protective Cancerian shell.
cancer,How important are the material things? How much money is enough? These are the sort of questions you will be asking as the new week begins and you may come up with several wrong answers before the right one comes along. Be patient.
cancer,Something shiny and new will catch your eye today and you won’t be happy until you possess it. Whether or not you can afford it won’t worry you in the slightest, as least not right now. Will you regret it tomorrow? Who cares! ,cancer,Don’t scatter your energy in too many directions today or you may fail to reach your number one goal. And that would be a shame because there is so much you can accomplish and so many lives you can change in beneficial ways. ,cancer,As Venus moves into your opposite sign of Capricorn today you will find it easier to be more outgoing and sociable and that’s good because you have been a bit too self-obsessed of late. You’re allowed to have fun – and look for love! ,cancer,There is a possibility that you will come into money over the next few days – and a possibility that you will spend it all in record quick time! Mars in the wealth area of your chart warns that others won’t be pleased by your extravagance.
cancer,Sometimes you can be too trusting for your own good and the planets warn if you believe what a work colleague tells today it will cost you in some way. Either they are deceiving you or someone else is deceiving both of you.
cancer,There is a task you would like to forget about but the powers that be won’t let you, so you might as well get on with it and get it over with. Make a god job of it though or they may make you do it all over again!,cancer,If someone tries to force you to do things you don’t want to do it may be because you have given them the impression you don’t mind taking orders. Now you will have to do something extreme to let them know it isn’t true.
cancer,You need to face up to your problems and you need to let certain people know that you will no longer be their whipping boy. But don’t just say it – do something positive that makes them believe that this time you mean it. ,cancer,This could be a lucky day for you, especially if you are prepared to overcome your own cautious nature and take a risk of some kind. Don’t let anyone tell you that something cannot be done: where there is a will there is always a way. ,cancer,There is no point starting a fight you know you cannot win. For some strange reason you feel you must prove yourself to the world, but that simply is not true. Besides, what does it prove if you end up flat on your back? ,cancer,You will be rather impulsive today and if you make it through to the weekend without some kind of emotional drama you will be very lucky indeed. Or maybe you’re the kind of Cancerian who thrives on a bit of drama now and again?,cancer,If you make an effort to be pleasant over the next 48 hours and you will benefit in ways you had not expected until well into the new year. Others may be difficult to deal with at times but you don’t have to be like them.  ,cancer,Give up the struggle and do what partners and colleagues want you to do. That may sound like an unacceptable loss of freedom but the planets indicate that it will actually be a lot of fun. You don’t have to be in control all the time.
cancer,This promises to be an interesting time and many strange things are likely to happen over the next few days. Chances are you will meet people who challenge your worldview and encourage you to look at life in new and exciting ways. ,cancer,If someone tries to interfere in your personal affairs over the next 24 hours you must let them know in no uncertain terms that you’re not having it. Sometimes you have to act tough right from the start and this is one of those times. ,cancer,According to the planets someone will try to pressure you into justifying what you are doing but there is no reason at all why you should play their game. Do what feels right to you and, if others don’t like it, that’s just too bad. ,cancer,Put your own needs first today and ignore those who say you are being selfish. It’s about time certain people were made to realize that you do not exist simply to make life easier for them. It’s not you who is being selfish.
cancer,It may be obvious that a friend or relative is keeping something from you but there is a very good reason for it. This is one of those occasions when it really is better that you don’t know what is going on. It will keep you from worrying. ,cancer,This is a great time for partnerships, be they personal or professional in nature. With both the Sun and Venus moving through your opposite sign you will find it easy to persuade just about anyone to do your bidding. Take advantage of it! ,cancer,Partners and loved ones are determined to prove their worth, so by all means sit back and let them do the bulk of the work. Let them know you trust them and in return they will find ways to make your life more enjoyable.
cancer,Be careful what you say today because if you are not absolutely clear about your meaning someone could take your words the wrong way and cause a scene. Polish up your communication skills – you are going to need them this week.
cancer,Try not to get obsessive about something that is clearly unattainable or you could face all sorts of problems come Thursday when Mars opposes Jupiter across the financial axis of your chart. Not everything that has value deserves to be valued.
cancer,According to the planets you could easily be panicked into making a move that could be disastrous on all levels. Just because the year is coming to an end does not mean you have to speed things up and take instant decisions. Calm down.
cancer,This is potentially one of the most exciting times ever and if you find that hard to believe right now, don’t worry – what happens over the next few days will surely convince you. A new year, a new challenge and, maybe, a new you too. ,cancer,This could be a challenging day for a relationship of some sort and you will have to call on your powers of self-control not to get too emotional. Someone needs to keep a clear head – and that someone will have to be you. ,cancer,You seem to be coming in for a lot of criticism of late but don’t worry about it. Some people go out of their way to find fault for no better reason than they resent your popularity and success. Give them something more to resent this weekend. ,cancer,Because tomorrow’s full moon takes place in your birth sign you could get a bit emotional. Looking back from the middle of the week you will wonder what came over you, but even a Cancer loses it once in a while.
cancer,A full moon in your birth sign means it’s unlikely you will be feeling your best today but that’s okay because friends and family will go out of their way to cheer you up. There really is no reason why you should be depressed. ,cancer,You need to stay on your toes both physically and mentally, because unexpected events will test you to the limit. The good news is that one of those events will bring with it a golden opportunity, the kind that comes around all too rarely.
cancer,You may feel super confident at the moment but the planets warn you should think long and hard before taking on someone in a position of power. If you feel the need to prove yourself wait until Mars changes signs on the 12th. ,cancer,Start planning your next major career move. The planets indicate that you know what you want and you know how to get it, so move fast and impress people in positions of authority. It won’t be long before you are on the rise.
cancer,You want to make a good impression on employers and people in positions of authority but you also want to tell the truth – and you may not be able to do both. Be honest today, both with others and with yourself. ,cancer,You may spend a bit too much money this weekend but it’s no big deal. Jupiter, planet of extravagance but also of luck, will bring new opportunities to boost your bank balance. Go on, splash out – you know you want to.
cancer,Don’t waste time chasing after something you cannot have and which you secretly suspect may not be good for you even if you did manage to get it. Apply your intensity and intelligence to something more deserving of your attention. ,cancer,You want to do something out of the ordinary, something different, something amazing, something outrageous. Only you can decide what that something is going to be but the planets indicate it will be fun, and change your life for the better.
cancer,Don’t worry if you find yourself moving in the opposite direction to everyone else today because no harm will come of it. Most likely it is they who have got it wrong and you who will be proved right in the long-term. Then you can gloat. ,cancer,Today’s positive cosmic influences suggest you can ask for almost anything you want and partners and loved ones will hand it over with no questions asked. Make the most of it – you know from experience that this kind of luck rarely lasts. ,cancer,You may be short of cash at the moment but you can still find ways to get what you want. Cancer is nothing if not resourceful and if you cannot satisfy your needs one way you will satisfy them another – and it won’t cost you a cent. ,cancer,A few days from now you will look back and wonder why and how you allowed yourself to get so worked up about a relationship matter. Don’t dwell on it though – life always moves on and so should you.
cancer,You will go out of your way to help someone this weekend, both because you feel it is the right thing to do and because you think you may benefit in some way. If you help them now they will help you even more later on.
cancer,When the Sun moves into your fellow Air sign of Aquarius on Tuesday you will find that so many of the things you have been worrying about no longer matter. Actually it’s doubtful if they mattered in the first place.
cancer,If facts and figures don’t add up then you must investigate the matter. Yes, you may annoy a few people but as it’s your reputation and your money that is at stake you cannot afford to take chances. Get to the bottom of it.
cancer,Work and money matters will be top of your agenda today and for the rest of the week and the planets indicate if you work hard now you will make a name for yourself and make a handsome profit before the end of the month.
cancer,Something you had high hopes for seems to have come to nothing and, of course, you are disappointed. But don’t dwell on it too long because there are so many other interesting things you could be doing. Don’t waste tears on yesterday’s news. ,cancer,Don’t worry if you fall behind in your schedule today because you will catch up with ease tomorrow when Saturn compels you to act. It’s nice to be on top of your workload but it’s no big deal if you waste time occasionally.
cancer,Make forgive and forget your motto today. According to the planets it simply is not worth your while continuing some kind of feud – in fact everyone concerned would be delighted if you were to pretend that nothing ever happened.
cancer,The only danger this weekend is that you could rush into something you are not prepared for, simply because you fear that if you don’t get in first you will somehow miss out. That’s nonsense. Take your time and get it right. ,cancer,You will have to put your nose to the grindstone if you are to reach your goals over the next few days. However, as Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your fellow Water sign of Pisces on Tuesday you’ll find ways to relax as well. ,cancer,This is potentially an excellent time for you but you find that hard to believe. Why? Because Mercury is playing tricks on your mind. Don’t worry, a few days from now something remarkable, and most welcome, is going to happen. ,cancer,It may seem as if your fate is in the hands of other people, and maybe it is, but that is no reason to worry. On the contrary, if you let partners take the big decisions today you will benefit both professionally and financially.
cancer,Keep your eyes and ears open today because something you see or hear could be the final piece in a puzzle that has been causing you sleepless nights. No doubt you will kick yourself mentally when you realize how simple it was. ,cancer,You need to get tough today, firstly with yourself for being far too wasteful of late, then with those who seem to believe that you exist only to make life easier for them. Looks like they will be on a steep learning curve. ,cancer,Mars and Pluto are nicely aligned today and you could not wish for a better influence to get things done. It is, of course, up to you what you choose to do with your time and your energy but whatever it is you must do it BIG.
cancer,Venus in your fellow Water sign of Pisces makes it so much easier to get along with people, even those you don’t like for one reason or another. Even if you fall out with someone this weekend you will very soon be friends again.
cancer,There is a chance you will come into money over the next few days, maybe through sheer good fortune or maybe because an investment has paid off at last. Whatever the reason don’t let anyone tell you that you do not deserve it – you do. ,cancer,If you make an effort to help someone in need today it will make both them and you feel better. But why help one person when, by joining some kind of charitable or progressive movement, you could help thousands, or even millions?,cancer,You may be tempted to take some kind of risk today but as there is a full moon in the area of your chart that governs your wealth that may not be a good idea. Do you know all the facts? If not it could prove costly.
cancer,Try one or two things you would not normally attempt today. The results could be spectacular. Of course, the results could also be spectacularly disappointing but that is a risk worth taking and really not much of a risk at all.
cancer,You cannot be expected to make an unbiased decision about something where your own interests are at stake. Either do what is best for yourself or ask a neutral third party to adjudicate on what should be done. ,cancer,Under no circumstances commit yourself to anything of a business or financial nature today. If others try to pressure you into signing on the dotted line that is a sure sign you should wait. There’s no rush, at least not for you. ,cancer,With Venus moving through one of the most open and outgoing areas of your chart this weekend you must not limit yourself to your home or your office. Get out into the world. Discover new places and meet new people.
cancer,Don’t be afraid to try something new this week. If you take an original approach to a familiar problem you will be amazed how quickly you find a solution. That applies especially to money and business matters. You could make a fortune. ,cancer,Try not to let worries and fears get the better of you today. Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means you must consciously and continually strive to stay cheerful. Go on, give it a try – it’s really not that hard. ,cancer,No matter what negative things may happen today or tomorrow you must laugh at them long and loud. This is one of those days when, if you look on the dark side, you will only make matters worse. Think yourself happy.
cancer,Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving in your favor again you won’t have much trouble working out what needs to be done. The most pressing thing, of course, is to get your financial affairs in some sort of order.
cancer,If a friend or colleague tries to take liberties with your kindly nature today you must let them know it isn’t going to happen. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Don’t do other people’s work as well as your own. ,cancer,Don’t give up on something just because it does not seem to be working out the way you intended. That applies doubly if you have spent a lot of money on it. Give it time and you will eventually see a return on your investment.
cancer,Don’t attach too much importance to material things over the next 48 hours or you could get rather emotional when something you value is taken away from you. Real security depends not on what you possess but on your inner strength.
cancer,Travel and social activities will be top of your agenda this week, so don’t tie yourself down to anything that could stop you getting out and about. Your mind will also be open to new ideas, some of them a bit outrageous! ,cancer,What happens today and tomorrow could be rather challenging. People you deal with on a one-to-one basis will try to impose their will on you and the only way to stop them is to stand up for yourself. They will admire your courage. ,cancer,Ignore your critics and get on with what you know you should be doing. The only mistake you made was letting them know what you were planning. Next time keep it to yourself. You can live without their feedback. ,cancer,Do you keep quiet about an issue you have strong opinions about, just so you can keep things calm and not hurt other people’s feelings? No you do not. Speak up and let the world know what you believe. You don’t have to play nice. ,cancer,The planets suggest you will say something shocking today, just for the fun of it. It may be amusing to you but others won’t be so happy about it and your reputation could suffer as a result. Seriously, does it need to be said?,cancer,You could easily lose patience with someone on the work front today, but if you are smart you will hold back from saying anything too negative. They could make things tough for you later if they decide they don’t like your attitude.
cancer,Try to remember that you are negotiating from a position of strength and that others will have to make concessions to you – not the other way round. Sometimes you can be far too soft for your own good. Strike a hard bargain. ,cancer,You can work alone during the early part of the week if you want to but later on you must join forces with those who share your aims and ambitions. If you feel restless then by all means go off and do something completely different. ,cancer,If someone you live or work with needs assistance today, and according to the planets they most likely will, you will go out of your way to help them. But let them know you cannot possibly ride to the rescue each and every time.
cancer,You won’t be in one of your more sociable moods today but that’s okay because you need time to yourself to plan your next move. Don’t let practical considerations make you give up on a long-term ambition. It CAN be done if you desire it enough,cancer,You want to be on the move today. Most of all you want to get away from your usual environment and do something different. But don’t make it anything too energetic – if you can’t do it sitting down it’s most likely not for you! ,cancer,No matter how annoyed you may be with a particular person your sixth sense should be telling you this is not the time to put your feelings into words. Bide your time and hit back only when you have more evidence to make your case.
cancer,No one is perfect, not even a Cancer, and if you accept that fact you won’t waste valuable time worrying that you failed to live up to expectations. The only reason you feel down is because you judge yourself too harshly.
cancer,Push ahead with your plans and show employers and other important people that you must be taken seriously. Work for yourself this weekend rather than for other people. Everything you do must be geared towards your own long-term ambitions.
cancer,You have energy and enthusiasm to spare and that’s good because someone you work or do business with will need your help over the next few days. If you assist them now you will be in their good books for a long time to come. ,cancer,Something you value will go out of your life today and, of course, you will be a little sad. But you know that you need to make room for the even better things that will be coming your way very soon. This is no time for sentiment. ,cancer,If anyone tries to push you around or force you in a direction you don’t want to go they will soon learn the error of their ways. You are in no mood to take nonsense from anyone and if others can’t read the warning signals, well, watch out!,cancer,Make an effort to get out and about and meet as wide a range of people as possible. You may not like everyone you encounter but each and every one of them will have something worth hearing, something you can turn to your advantage.
cancer,Don’t waste precious time and energy on petty arguments today because you should be channeling everything you have got in productive directions. What you do over the next few days will set the scene for the next few months – so make it big.
cancer,Do you follow your instincts or do you follow your friends? That is the question you must answer today and it must be one thing or the other. First, of course, you need to decide what means the most to you: ambition or popularity.
cancer,It seems you are having second thoughts about an opinion you once took for granted, and that’s good because this is the right time of year to ask questions of the “what’s it all about” variety. Who knows, you may even find the answer.
cancer,Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart means you will be thinking seriously about what you do for a living over the next few days. Could it be time for a change of direction? Yes, it could, so go all the way.
cancer,One of the most challenging times of the year will begin when the Sun changes signs on the 20th but between now and then there are plenty of things you can do to make life easier for yourself. For a start, stop worrying about your career. ,cancer,With Mars and Jupiter perfectly aligned today success is a foregone conclusion. No matter how many times you have failed or been rebuffed in the past you will get what you want now – and the more you want the more you will get.
cancer,Your mind is a powerful tool and if you think positive thoughts today and for the rest of the week there is no doubt that positive things will occur. No matter what happens in the world around you strive to rise above it with a smile.
cancer,It appears you have finally realized that you have been wasting a lot of time and a lot of energy on something that is not worth the effort. That something will fade in importance over the next few days. Soon you will have forgotten it ever existed.
cancer,You have some very strong opinions about certain issues and what happens today will confirm that they are spot on. But don’t use that as an excuse not to look at new ideas, because life never stands still and neither should you. ,cancer,You can, if you wish, put off finishing a project that is beginning to bore you, but deep down you know you should press on and complete it. You have come so far and done so much – don’t waste all that time and effort now.
cancer,There may be times over the next few days when it seems you have bitten off more than you can chew and you consider backing away from certain commitments. Get over that idea straight away A promise is a promise – don’t let others down.
cancer,It is quite possible you could come into money this week but it is also possible that you will lose money. Jupiter, planet of luck but also extravagance, warns you need to stay on top of the wasteful side of your nature. ,cancer,You will have no trouble asserting yourself today but with Venus, planet of harmony, moving into the friendship area of your chart why bother being assertive when you can charm your way to success? Everyone wants to be on your side.
cancer,Decide what your number one priority is going to be and stick to it come what may. The planets warn you could easily find yourself talked into doing things today that don’t do you any favors at all, so be tough with yourself.
cancer,There is no need to go to extremes today, even though certain individuals may be urging you to do just that. In all areas of your life, but especially where business and finances are concerned, you must avoid excessive behavior. ,cancer,The Sun moves into the area of your chart that governs your social and professional status today. What it means is that over the next few weeks you will get many opportunities to better yourself – and you must not be slow in taking them.
cancer,This is an important weekend for you and by the end of it you will have made some serious decisions concerning your career or vocation. But it does not have to be about serious things completely – you’re allowed to have fun as well. ,cancer,The bigger the problem the more you like it as it gives you a chance to show your brainpower. In fact it is quite likely that you will spend a large part of the day solving other people’s dilemmas for them. You will certainly be in demand. ,cancer,Try not to be too aggressive today, even if you think it is justified. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money-related matters. In a nutshell: don’t upset people whose support you may need in the near future. ,cancer,You can no longer rely on other people to come to your rescue if you go too far. The only reason you got away with so much recently is because others were there to catch you when you fell. Now the safety net has gone.
cancer,As Saturn links with the Sun today your natural caution will work in your favor, especially on the work front. While others are bigging it up and throwing their money around you will be quietly making plans to secure your own position.
cancer,This is a good day to chat with friends and plan social outings of one sort or another. But don’t take up too many invitations between now and the weekend – you won’t be popular if you have to cancel some of them.
cancer,Don’t let those who say you are behaving in an illogical manner persuade you to change your ways. What you are doing may look silly to them but from your point of view it makes sense – and it is your point of view that matters.
cancer,As Jupiter is moving retrograde in the financial area of your chart you should cut back on luxuries and make sure you get value for money in everything you buy. Your luck will turn later but for now every cent must be made to count.
cancer,You may not be in the most sociable of moods at the moment but that’s okay because the more time you spend thinking and planning the better. Others can party if they want to – you have better things to do with your energy. ,cancer,It isn’t enough that you just feel confident, you must apply that confidence and get important things done. Both in your personal life and at work there are changes that need to be made. Make them now while you are in the mood. ,cancer,It may seem as if you can get away with anything now, and maybe you can, but later in the month you won’t be so lucky, so look ahead, think ahead and, if you are ahead, make sure you stay ahead. Cancer is supposed to be cautious. ,cancer,There is a huge luck factor working in your favor now and if you are smart you will milk it for all it is worth. Don’t worry that you might not deserve some of the good things you get – the universe says it’s your turn to benefit.
cancer,Something unexpected will happen today, something that comes at you out of the blue. It may be annoying if it disrupts your plans but you won’t be negative about it for long: how could you when it makes life so much more enjoyable?,cancer,You’ve had your fill of emotional ups and downs of late but once tomorrow’s lunar eclipse has passed a more positive phase will begin. At last you can stop worrying about other people’s problems and do something about your own.
cancer,You will find it difficult to control your emotions this weekend and someone is sure to say or do something that makes your blood boil. The eclipse not only distorts your feelings but makes it difficult to know what is really going on, so take care.
cancer,You are so close to success – all you have to do is keep doing what you are doing and within a matter of days you will make the breakthrough you have been dreaming of. Soon you will be the person everyone wants to know! ,cancer,If you want to impress employers and other important people then now is the time. Don’t hide yourself away: show them, and the world in general, what you are capable of. Self-confidence plus ambition is a surefire recipe for success.
cancer,You will be tempted to place your trust in a stranger who says the right things, but that does not mean you are doing the right thing. Are things so bad that you have to confide in someone you know nothing about? Trust yourself for a change.
cancer,The decisions you make today will either come back to help you or come back to haunt you later in the month, so make sure they are good decisions and make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for emotionally and financially.
cancer,You will have to deal with a difficult person today and although it might be a pain you are advised not to say or do anything that could turn them against you. According to the planets you will need this person’s assistance very soon.
cancer,You worry too much. The planets suggest that what you have been getting so worked up about in recent weeks is not worth the heartbreak, so pull your attention away from it and focus only on things that make you smile.
cancer,If someone tries to take liberties with your generous nature this week you must come down on them hard. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your career. Under no circumstances take on other people’s work.
cancer,Try not to be too cynical about what is going on around you. Some people can be so negative in the way they look at the world but there is no reason why you should join them. If you think positive you can make positive things happen. ,cancer,There may be a crisis of some sort over the next 24 hours but your confidence is sky high at the moment so chances are you will find a solution. Others will turn to you when their lives go into freefall. Somehow you know what to do.
cancer,This could be and should be a special time for you. Like all Cancerians you want to do things for other people, to make the world a better place in some way or other, and your chance to do so will arrive very soon.
cancer,People come to you with their problems all the time, which is nice in a way, but unless you want the entire day to be taken up listening to sob stories you will need to draw a line. You’re entitled to some privacy.
cancer,A new moon in the career area of your chart means you will be focusing on work plans over the next 48 hours. Others may say you should not be so serious about life but only because they are nowhere near as ambitious as you.
cancer,You cannot do it all by yourself, so don’t even try. If you need help during the early part of the week, and you will, you must ask for it. You will be surprised how quickly friends and colleagues rally to your cause.
cancer,Don’t worry too much about trying to impress other people, just get on with your life and do what feels right. With the Sun firmly on your side again you will get all the approval you could wish for over the next few days.
cancer,One of the most trying periods of the year has come to an end and you managed to survive! You may be in the mood to celebrate but don’t go over the top. The planets warn you need to stay out of trouble today.
cancer,You have every right to believe what you believe and you must make sure others know that. You must also let them know that you have no intention of changing your viewpoint. Why should you when you are so obviously right?,cancer,Someone who is usually very open with you will be secretive for no good reason today, but don’t take it to heart because it is unlikely to have anything to do with you personally. They will be their usual bubbly self again come the weekend.
cancer,You will find yourself up against a stubborn opponent today and you may have to accept that you are not going to shift them. Fortunately, the world is a big enough place for both of you – so long as you are on different continents!,cancer,If there is any doubt that you won’t be able to honor a s this weekend you must let others know as early as possible. They won’t be happy with you, of course, but at least you will have given them time to make other arrangements. ,cancer,Don’t worry if you go too far and say too much over the next few days. Later in the week you will come to your senses and offer your sincere apologies, which others will accept, but in future they won’t be so eager to annoy you. ,cancer,You will find yourself up against someone who is every bit as immovable as you, so the best you can hope for is a stalemate. Don’t waste your time and energy on battles like this that cannot be won – focus on the ones where you have the advantage.
cancer,Try not to worry what others might think of you. If certain people disapprove of what you are doing you should take that as a sign that you are doing the right thing. In fact, the more you shock them the better!,cancer,You don’t lack for ideas or the confidence to use them but you should nevertheless keep them to yourself for a bit. The planets warn this is not a good time to share what you know, not even with like-minded people. Bide your time.
cancer,No matter what happens today you must remember at all times and in all situations that you are not a victim. You alone control your destiny and you alone have the power to change things for the better. Be positive at every turn.
cancer,There are times when you are quite unsociable and this is one of them. By all means spend some time by yourself to think things through and decide what your next major move is going to be. Success is more likely if you plan well ahead. ,cancer,Chances are you will come to the conclusion that a certain person cannot be trusted or relied on and therefore it is pointless trying to get along with them. Your frustration is understandable but your reasoning is wrong. Take another look.
cancer,You will make a big impression over the next few days, but will it be a positive one? Don’t feel guilty if you lose your temper with someone but if you do go over the top make sure you apologize the moment you calm down. ,cancer,The best way to make the most of the Sun in one of the most positive areas of your chart is to believe that all things are possible. Do what your heart tells you is right today, even if everyone else seems to think it is wrong. ,cancer,You know what you want and you know where to get it, so why do you hesitate? Maybe it’s because you fear you don’t have the right to just take it. Maybe you don’t but you know what they say: possession is nine-tenths of the law.
cancer,Be brutally honest today, both with yourself and with other people. The fact is you don’t really care what others think, you care only for the truth, and what you discover over the next 24 hours will affect you profoundly.
cancer,You have nothing to worry about and everything to look forward to, so stop being so fearful and get out there into the world. The planets indicate if you think lucky you will be lucky – so what have you got to lose?,cancer,There seems to be quite a bit of tension in the air at the moment and if you are involved in matters of a joint nature it will pay you to tone down your views and opinions a bit. But only a bit – don’t give in altogether.
cancer,Once again you are worrying about things over which you have no control and it’s a complete waste of time. Yes, certain developments may be unsettling but it’s not the end of the world, so lighten up. Life is still wonderful. ,cancer,There are so many things you want to change but the most important thing that needs changing is your own way of looking at life. Do a bit of self-analysis this week and get rid of beliefs and habits which have outlived their usefulness. ,cancer,If you do a good deed or make some kind of sacrifice for a friend or relative over the next 24 hours you are sure to receive a reward or compensation. The best reward of all, however, is to know that you are appreciated. ,cancer,You will have to do something today that takes up a lot of your time but you know if you leave it to other people they will mess it up completely. Try to convince yourself it’s what you really want to do, even though it’s not.
cancer,Don’t sell your services too cheap. Just because someone may be short of cash does not mean you should lower your prices for them. A job worth doing is a job worth getting paid the going rate for – and your rates should always be high.
cancer,Try not to let praise go to your head today because there is a real possibility that someone is bigging you up just so they can knock you down again. Also, anyone who encourages you to take risks and cut corners is not to be trusted.
cancer,The whole world could be against you today and you won’t care a bit: in fact you will enjoy being the odd one out. You are looking for a challenge, the kind that no one expects you to win. Watch their faces when you succeed!,cancer,Some people seem to delight in finding fault with everything you do and, to put it mildly, it’s beginning to annoy you. In which case you need to start making other plans. You don’t have to stay with them. Maybe it’s time to move on.
cancer,Be as stubborn as you like over the next 24 hours. Don’t give an inch of ground to anyone. This is one of those occasions when you hold all the cards and can do just about anything you please. Who is going to stop you? ,cancer,You will say something today that causes uproar, especially among people who believe that certain things must not be brought into the open. There is no way you are going to give in to censorship, and certainly not self-censorship. ,cancer,With Venus, planet of harmony, moving through your birth sign you don’t feel under so much pressure and can spend more time with those you love. For too long you have kept your feelings under wraps – now it’s time to show them off.
cancer,You have nothing to be worried about and everything to look forward to over the next few days and you need to keep reminding yourself of that fact. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will challenge you to always be positive.
cancer,Don’t do things for other people that they really should be doing for themselves. As the Sun moves into the most sensitive area of your chart today someone may try to make you feel guilty so they can take advantage of you. Don’t let them.
cancer,If you throw yourself into a new project today there is every possibility you will be looking for a way to get out of it tomorrow, so think before you act. There are enough existing projects that need to be finished to keep you busy.
cancer,There are only so many hours in a weekend and if you try to cram everything into the next 48 hours the result could be chaos. The message of the stars is that you should slow down – that way, strangely, you may even get more done. ,cancer,You may be tempted to break rules or cut corners this week but the planets warn that could be a serious mistake. What you gain in time and money you will lose in integrity and reputation, and they will be very hard to get back again.
cancer,Make the most of Venus in your birth sign to remind those you care for that whatever they do is all right by you. Let them know too that you intend to make them feel good about themselves, about you and about life in general. ,cancer,You may not care too much about money and possessions but try not to give others the impression today that you will give them whatever it is they want from you. Be generous by all means but don’t be a fool about it. ,cancer,Do the opposite of what your instincts tell you today. If you feel like speeding up, then slow down. If you feel like slowing down, then speed up. Everything is up in the air at the moment, including your own thoughts and feelings.
cancer,Try not to criticize a colleague for what goes wrong today, even if it is clearly their fault. Most likely they will feel even worse about it than you do, so let them know you don’t blame them and look for ways to resolve the situation together.
cancer,Reality is overrated at times and the planets suggest your fantasies will be a lot of fun over the next few days. Try to remember though that not everyone shares your tastes, especially when it comes to travel and social events.
cancer,You know what you need to do but for some strange reason you can’t seem to make a start. It may be frustrating but there could well be a good cosmic reason why you are being held back. Take the hint and give it more time.
cancer,Don’t take what happens over the next three or four days too seriously. Full moons tend to make people say and do silly things, so if someone you live or work with annoys you with their emotional antics let it pass. It’s no big deal. ,cancer,Your feelings are sure to be intense during the early part of the week, so if there is anything you have to do that requires a clear head it might pay to wait until Thursday or even Friday. Until then it’s unlikely you will be thinking straight. ,cancer,If you expect things to go wrong today they most likely will. However, if you expect things to go right then even the most difficult of situations could work in your favor. It’s not about magic, it’s about your mind creating your world.
cancer,If you find yourself arguing with someone over a subject you feel strongly about today make sure it does not get out of hand. It is not worth putting a friendship at risk simply to win a debate that soon everyone will have forgotten about.
cancer,If you don’t get what you want one way today you will surely get it another – you are in one of your imperious moods, the kind where you can easily intimidate the people you deal with. No one says No to a Cancer – at least not today.
cancer,In recent weeks you had to get serious about your money situation but as Venus moves into the most materialistic area of your chart today you won’t have to make quite so many sacrifices – and those you do make could even be fun. ,cancer,Before you get your purse out and buy something shiny and new you must make sure it is what you need and you must make sure you can afford it. Even then, it may be better to keep your cash in your pocket. ,cancer,Something or someone will have to give over the next few days and it could be you. The planets warn you are pushing yourself way too hard, so slow down, calm down and reward yourself with some well-earned down time.
cancer,If you keep your feelings bottled up inside you now they are likely to explode later in the week, so maybe it is better to let it all come out. That cool, tough guy act is not fooling anyone, except maybe yourself. ,cancer,Act as if important people are watching your every move – because most likely they are. Uranus, planet of the unexpected, is sure to bring career changes of some sort but there is no need to worry because you are the one who will benefit.
cancer,For some strange reason you feel trapped, unable to move one way or the other. But who says you have to move? Who says you have to do anything? Most likely the only restrictions in your life are the ones you have placed on yourself.
cancer,Why so cautious? Why so reluctant to take risks? Whatever the reason you need to get over it because there is some really good news coming your way and come the weekend you won’t be cautious at all – you may even be reckless.
cancer,If you use your imagination today and over the weekend you will find ways to make it pay. But don’t think of that just in the usual financial sense – think of ways you can improve all your relationships, at home and at work.
cancer,Everything in life has a natural cycle and the part of the cycle you are going through at the moment is challenging to say the least. But that’s okay. A week or so from now a new and better phase will begin, so keep smiling.
cancer,Try to be more imaginative over the coming week Try to look at old problems in new ways. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters where the usual way of doing things is unlikely to bring the results you seek.
cancer,You will be both sociable and aloof over the next 24 hours. Conflicting aspects at work in your chart mean you will go from one extreme to the other in the blink of an eye. At least no one can say you are too predictable.
cancer,Your solar year is drawing to a close and a new cycle will begin when the Sun moves into your sign next weekend. What you do between now and then is of huge importance. Be brave: chase that dream you have so often avoided.
cancer,If you are the kind of Cancer who hates to see injustice then now is the time to do something about it. There are so many good causes out there and all of them are crying out for people with your brand of compassion. Get involved.
cancer,The time has come to look back over the previous year and decide which of your ambitions you must leave in the past and which you can take with you into the future. Dream, but be ruthlessly realistic as well.
cancer,Although recent events have had a negative effect on your self-belief you will make up for it when the Sun moves into your sign at the weekend. Today you are advised to wind down, conserve your energy and not take yourself too seriously.
cancer,The Sun enters your birth sign tomorrow and a new solar year gets under way. You may not notice much of a difference to start with but by the middle of next week your confidence will be back and you will be looking forward with real excitement.
cancer,Take as many risks as you like over the next few days – in fact, the more the merrier. This is your time of year and you must make the most of it, and with Mars on your side as well from Wednesday you really can’t lose.
cancer,Today’s Jupiter-Uranus link will put you in a positive frame of mind but there is still a danger that you could overestimate your abilities and do something silly. In all situations, make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for.
cancer,A degree of caution is called for over the next 24 hours. Both at home and at work you would be wise to play safe, even in situations where you feel you are in control. Don’t let the world know too much about your plans.
cancer,You won’t be content to sit back and watch other people snatch the glory today – you want it all for yourself. With Mars moving into your birth sign you intend to be Number One and your self-belief will make it happen. ,cancer,No matter what happens today you must not let anything, or anyone, get to you. Not that anything drastic is likely to occur but if something upsets you in even a small way then common sense could easily fly out the window. ,cancer,What do you fear the most? Whatever it is and however many sleepless nights it may have given you in the past you must now face up to it and overcome it once and for all. Most likely you will discover it really isn’t such a nightmare after all.
cancer,So many of the things you have been worrying about bear little or no relation to reality. Your main task this weekend is to start thinking more positively, because that is the only way you are going to break the negative cycle that is holding you back. ,cancer,Difficulties in one-to-one relationships, be they personal or professional in nature, are likely this week. The important thing is that you maintain a positive outlook at all times and in all situations. This is only a passing phase, so let it pass – it won’t take long.
cancer,You have a great deal of energy at your disposal now but will you use it wisely? There is a real danger that you could squander your resources on things that bring no lasting benefit. Focus on essentials and don’t get carried away.
cancer,Some kind of upheaval is likely today. The good news is that with Mars in your sign you have the courage to deal with whatever crisis might arise. Don’t fear a rival because they have a reputation. You can be a pretty tough nut yourself.
cancer,There are times when everything goes wrong and times when it all comes together and this is most definitely one of the latter. Today’s Venus-Jupiter link suggests s that in all areas of your life you will meet with unparalleled success.
cancer,You have hit all your targets and fulfilled all your ambitions but still there are people who demand you do more. That’s okay. With both the Sun and Mars in your sign there are no limits to what you can accomplish. Climb even higher.
cancer,Don’t listen to what others say you should be doing, just follow your heart and trust it will take you where you most need to go. Life is too short to worry about making the right impression, so just do what comes naturally.
cancer,You may be tempted to give up on something that is proving more difficult than you expected but you must stick with it a while longer. Keep plugging away a few more days and you will get the breakthrough you were hoping for.
cancer,Mars in your sign gives you loads of energy, so if there is anything that needs doing get on with it right away. When dealing with difficult people remember that some respond best to reason and some respond best to pressure. ,cancer,Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start doing the things that will make your life more satisfying and secure. Mind planet Mercury joins the Sun in your sign today, so you will know with crystal clarity what needs to be done. Now do it!,cancer,You are in a generous mood at the moment and that’s good, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking it’s all about money. What others want from you is your time and your attention and your sympathy. Gifts are nice but not essential.
cancer,You may be super confident at the moment but the planets warn you need to be careful who you let into the secrets of your heart. It could be you have a rival for the object of your affections. Don’t let them know how you feel.
cancer,What happens over the next 48 hours will help you make sense of something that previously made no sense at all. Not only will it change the way you look at the world but the world will look at you in a new way too. ,cancer,No matter how wedded you may be to certain beliefs Monday’s Sun-Uranus link will encourage you to accept that there are many ways of looking at life. On the work front especially old routines are very much on the way out. ,cancer,Whatever you suggest, partners and colleagues seem determined to do the opposite. You could try to be smart and sell them a bluff. Suggest they do what you actually don’t want them to do. It’s an obvious trick but it might just work. ,cancer,So many things are going right for you now that you are beginning to believe that the breakthrough you have been dreaming of is about to arrive – and it is. The approaching new moon will bring something wonderful your way.
cancer,You can, if you wish, force your views and opinions on other people today but it’s unlikely to do you much good in the long-term. Besides, the moment you let down your guard they will go back to believing what they have always believed. ,cancer,Others may doubt that you are on the right track but with the new moon on your side you will win them over before the end of the day. This is your time of year and now is the best time of all to do something special.
cancer,It may feel as if time is running out, that if you don’t make a move soon you will miss out on a golden opportunity. But the planets urge you to be aware there are no shortcuts to success; you must work hard for everything you gain. ,cancer,Others will try to persuade you with facts and figures this weekend but you can sense that something is not quite right. No matter how appealing their offer may sound, don’t get involved. Be blunt if you have to. Make sure they get the message.
cancer,As the Sun leaves your sign this week it may feel as if something important is going out of your life, but even if that is true don’t worry about it. Everything in life tends to balance out: what you lose in one direction you will gain in another. ,cancer,The Sun leaves your birth sign on Thursday, which means you still have three days to get started on a project you have been putting off for ages. The fact is if you don’t get on with it now it will probably never get done. ,cancer,You need to keep things simple over the next few days, both at home and at work. Some things are important but most things are not, so go easy on yourself. Why look for difficult answers when easy answers will do just as well?,cancer,Mercury, planet of the mind, leaves your sign tomorrow, so it might be a smart move to get your plans and ideas in order over the next few hours. They may be big and exciting plans but how much are they going to cost you?,cancer,Money matters will be of even more importance than usual today and for the next few weeks. The planets indicate there is a lot at stake financially, so you must do whatever it takes to maximize your profits and minimize your losses. ,cancer,Your powers of persuasion are such that you can get just about anyone to do just about anything for you. Whether you use this power for good or for bad remains to be seen but use it you must – don’t waste it. ,cancer,Your powers of persuasion are such that you can get just about anyone to do just about anything for you. Whether you use this power for good or for bad remains to be seen but use it you must – don’t waste it. ,cancer,Watch out you don’t lose your temper for no good reason during the early part of the week. With Uranus, planet of the unexpected, beginning a retrograde phase small things and small-minded people are sure to annoy you. ,cancer,You are the type who demands perfection of yourself, but the current cosmic set-up is urging you to be less driven and to see that in some areas at least you don’t have to be the biggest and the best – not this week anyway.
cancer,If you need to persuade someone to give you something today you will no doubt be successful, but they will give even more if you wait until Friday’s full moon. Whatever you want they feel it is their duty to provide it for you.
cancer,You could come into a large sum of money over the next few days but you could also end up owing a large sum of money to someone else. If possible, stick with what you’ve got – the status quo is not so bad. ,cancer,You will be inclined to speak your mind today, but be warned: with Mercury linked to power planet Pluto you could be the one who is the topic of conversation if you stray too far from the facts. And what others say won’t be pleasant.
cancer,There is no way of knowing whether a certain situation will turn out for the best, so all you can do is go with the flow and hope that it will. It is highly unlikely that you will be everyone’s favorite today but why should you care?,cancer,Now is not the time to be confrontational, either at home or at work. Others will listen to reason this weekend but they won’t listen to anything that sounds like a threat or sounds like you consider yourself more intelligent or better informed.
cancer,Any doubts you had about what you should be doing with your life will disappear over the next few days. Don’t worry that you are not as good a person as you would like to be – you are who you are for a reason, so be happy.
cancer,No matter how carefully you have made your plans they are sure to be disrupted over the next few days. You won’t change anything by causing a scene, so take it all in your stride and make the best of the situation. A positive attitude is a must. ,cancer,There are certain things you have been unable to do of late but they will now come easy to you. In fact, there is nothing you cannot accomplish if you want it enough. Just make sure you really want it: don’t waste time chasing what you don’t need.
cancer,These may be difficult times for you but it’s not as bad as you like to make out. Put your work and your wellbeing first over the next 24 hours and start doing the kind of things that will help make your dreams come true.
cancer,There is so much that you need to stay in control of that you are beginning to fear it could all fall apart. The planets indicate that if you stay cool and don’t lose your nerve you will come through unscathed. Trust yourself more.
cancer,Don’t fret too much about your money situation because something will happen over the next few days that solves all your problems. Above all this weekend, don’t sell yourself short in deals and negotiations. Make sure you get what you are worth. ,cancer,The omens are good for the coming week, especially if you are on the move or visiting friends and relatives. The one thing you must not do is stay at home and watch the world through your television. The world should be watching you.
cancer,If you have gone to extremes in any way, shape or form in recent weeks opposing forces will bring you back toward the middle ground over the next few days. The more extreme you have been the less gentle will be the adjustment!,cancer,Everything is so quiet at the moment that you could be lulled into a false sense of security. Be careful you don’t agree to something that is not in your best interests. You don’t have to go along with what others want just to keep them happy.
cancer,You won’t lack for social invitations today but don’t feel you have to grace everyone with your presence. If you show your face too often you will begin to lose your rarity value. Even if you are not a celebrity as such you should act like one. ,cancer,Don’t be tempted to change your ways just to keep up with the latest fads and fashions. Yes, of course, the old ways are not always the best but, on this occasion, the planets indicate they are the safest, for you at least.
cancer,Where money matters and business issues are concerned it is essential that you meet others halfway. Also, don’t think you can promise something today and wriggle out of it tomorrow: if you fail to deliver your reputation will head south fast.
cancer,If you have allowed money matters to get out of hand of late then you must do something about it. The longer you put off making changes the more painful it will be in the long-term. Those debts won’t pay off themselves you know. ,cancer,You will get the chance to travel for both business and pleasure over the next seven days. No matter how fond you are of your own home you will want to explore new places and see new faces. Who said Cancer is never adventurous? ,cancer,The planets promise success and riches beyond your wildest dreams. Okay, so maybe it won’t be quite that spectacular but it will be worth having. Don’t get carried away though. What took so much effort to acquire won’t take much effort to lose.
cancer,Something remarkable will happen over the next few days and you must be ready to take advantage of it. It is tailor-made to meet your needs and desires, so prepare yourself mentally and emotionally and move fast when the time comes to act.
cancer,If something goes wrong over the next 24 hours – and it will – try to be philosophical about it. You should know by now that life moves in cycles and that whatever you lose today you will make up for tomorrow or the day after.
cancer,Today’s cosmic influences mark an ending of some sort, but the good thing about endings is that they make new beginnings possible, so don’t get upset if you have to say goodbye to something you cherish. Something even better will soon take its place. ,cancer,You have to decide whether or not to continue with some kind of creative project or artistic activity. Before you make that decision think about how much effort you have already put into it. All that will be wasted if you give up on it now.
cancer,You may not understand why certain things are happening but go with the flow and don’t be surprised if they work in your favor. The urge to travel will be strong over the coming few days but don’t use it as an excuse to run away!,cancer,Make sure you know who is a friend and who is an enemy, because if you get them mixed up the next few days could be difficult. If you are the kind who likes to believe that everyone is your buddy it may pay you to think again.
cancer,Changes in one area inevitably lead to changes in other areas so you must expect the changes that occurred last week to have a knock-on effect. The good news is that with luck planet Jupiter moving in your favor they should overwhelmingly be changes for the better. ,cancer,Travel and social plans are likely to be disrupted today and for several days to come, although nothing too drastic will happen so long as you look ahead, make allowances and make sure you have not forgotten anything important.
cancer,You need to decide whether to forgive someone who has let you down badly. They say a leopard can’t change its spots, so err on the side of caution and, even if you do give them the benefit of the doubt, don’t let them hurt you again. ,cancer,Something disturbing may occur today but if you look at it logically and from a higher perspective you will see that fate is teaching you a valuable lesson: that sometimes you have to give up one thing in order to get something better. ,cancer,Some of the people you meet today will be touchy for no apparent reason. Make sure you don’t get caught up in their petty disputes, because you have issues of your own that need dealing with. If you can, say out of their way.
cancer,You need to make a decision about a matter of some importance. However, because there is a full moon this weekend you should wait a few days before letting the world know what it is you are going to do. It makes opposition less likely.
cancer,Try not to get impatient with people who appear to be dragging their feet. Chances are they are simply out of their depth and are uncertain what to do next. You will only make matters worse if you accuse them of deliberately holding you up. ,cancer,It is important that you greet the week with a smile because if you start off on the wrong foot you won’t get much done. Neptune, planet of illusion and confusion, will make things look worse than they really are. Don’t be fooled – it’s all good. ,cancer,Usually you prefer to steer clear of the limelight but over the next 24 hours you will love the attention you attract – and there will be plenty. Deep down you rather enjoy it when people recognize you on the street. Be famous – not infamous.
cancer,It is important that you stay patient today, because if you start to get restless you may do something you later regret. Act as if you are being watched by people on whom your future depends, people you should be trying to impress.
cancer,The most important thing now is that you focus on quality rather than quantity. Too often in the past you have scattered your energies in all directions. Now you must concentrate on the two or three things that you do really well.
cancer,Your beliefs and opinions will come under fire today and there may be a very good reason for it. Could it be that some of your ideas went out of fashion years ago? Maybe it’s time to bring yourself more up to date.
cancer,Venus, planet of romance, is on fine form now but be careful. If you are the kind of Cancer who lets their emotions govern them you could fall deeply for someone who is totally unsuitable. Keep things on a friendly level, at least to start with.
cancer,You will be the center of attention over the next two or three days. Everyone will be looking at you and, if you are a shy and retiring Crab you won’t like it too much. That’s too bad because you can’t get away. Go on, put on a show.
cancer,Your all-or-nothing attitude to whatever situation you find yourself in over the next 24 hours will make sure you win and win handsomely. But take care you don’t create resentment. Secret enemies are always more dangerous than open ones. ,cancer,Just because someone has a different outlook to you does not mean you cannot work together or even be friends. Say what you have to say and say it well, then open your ears to what they have to tell you. Learn from each other. ,cancer,You will be inspired to visit new places and try out new things. You may not be the most adventurous member of the zodiac but every now and again you go right the other way and make up for it big time. Such a time is now.
cancer,You may have good reason to be annoyed by someone’s behavior but the approaching eclipse means it is not worth your time or your energy making a big issue of it. If certain individuals get you down then turn your back and walk away.
cancer,Because this weekend’s eclipse falls in the communications area of your chart you will find it easy to put across your point of view. That does not mean it will be the right point of view but others will trust you. But will you trust yourself?,cancer,You won’t be much in the mood for anything serious this week, so don’t force yourself. If all you want is to go out and have fun with your friends that is exactly what you should do. Do what makes you, and others, feel good.
cancer,According to the planets you should follow a course you have navigated profitably before rather than set out in a new direction. Despite what some people may say to the contrary there is no need for any type of major change.
cancer,If what you previously thought was a brilliant idea has come to nothing, abandon it. You may be tempted to give it another go but is it worth it? Probably not. There are more interesting things you can spend your time on today. ,cancer,Because recent months have been hectic for you there were a number of things you wanted to do but never quite got round to. Now you can begin to move in a more agreeable direction. Focus only on what brings a smile to your face.
cancer,There will always be good days and bad days but there will be a lot more of the former if you change the way you assess what is “good” and what is “bad”. You can be far too hard on yourself at times. Laugh more.
cancer,You will find yourself attracted to someone whose outlook on life is very different to your own. If you begin a relationship will it work? Maybe, maybe not, but you won’t know until you try, so make this the weekend when you start finding out. ,cancer,It will take more than logic and good sense to change a colleague’s mind about something this week – they are clearly determined not to budge. Why is that do you suppose? Could it be they know something you don’t? Find out. ,cancer,You may be eager to find out what is going on behind the scenes but don’t let others think you are desperate or they will keep you in the dark even more, just for the fun of it. Pretend you don’t care but keep digging quietly.
cancer,Try not to focus on other people’s faults and failings. Chances are you will make far too big a deal of matters that at most other times would not bother you in the slightest. Be positive, even when dealing with negative people.
cancer,More than anything now you need to make sure that the real foundation of your existence – your home and your family life – is built on solid ground. There are some major challenges coming and you won’t want to face them alone. ,cancer,You will have to get tough with someone who refuses to face up to their problems. You could approach them with kindness but they’ve had plenty of that already with no result, so tell them in no uncertain terms where they are going wrong.
cancer,This could be a difficult day as Mars encourages you to say things you may later regret. If you want to avoid unpleasant scenes further down the line you must promise yourself now that you will not lose your temper no matter what happens next.
cancer,The more you worry about things the worse they will get. What happens is going to happen whether you like it or not, so you might as well accept that and focus your attention on the kind of issues you can do something about.
cancer,Employers and other authority figures are not in the mood to play games, so keep your head down and try not to draw too much attention to yourself. You may be a law unto yourself at times but this week you would be wise not to make waves.
cancer,So many of the difficulties you have been experiencing in recent weeks will fade over the next few days. There will, of course, still be times when you feel as if life is conspiring against you but accept it and deal with it. It’s not a crisis.
cancer,You can sense that something is not right and you must act on what your instincts tell you. No matter how appealing an offer may sound you must not get involved. Be blunt if you have to: don’t worry about hurting others’ feelings.
cancer,Your feelings for a certain person are likely to come to the fore over the next 24 hours and that could cause problems. Why? Because both of you are already committed elsewhere and that spells Trouble with a capital T! ,cancer,You may be under the impression that you can say anything to anyone and get away with it but don’t be so sure. Neptune, planet of illusion, warns that although you seem to be under divine protection it could rapidly be withdrawn.
cancer,The thing you most want to avoid is the thing you most need to face up to. It is not going to go away of its own accord, so toughen up and tackle it head on. Chances are you will be amazed how easy it is.
cancer,Think twice before saying anything that might lead to bad feelings, especially on the home front where loved ones are liable to be touchy in the extreme. This is not a good time to speak from the heart, not even if your heart is true.
cancer,Seek out people and situations that inspire you. It is time to come out of your shell and remind the world that you exist. Don’t limit yourself to the tried and tested way of doing things – be inventive and adventurous. You’ll surprise a few people.
cancer,Your feelings for a certain individual will reach a peak over the next few days, which is nice, but other aspects warn this may not be the best time to reveal your true thoughts and intentions. Keep them secret just a little while longer. ,cancer,There is no point trying to force other people to see things your way. Whatever you suggest they will immediately go out and do the opposite. You could, of course, try to be smart and bluff them but, seriously, is it worth the effort? ,cancer,You are advised to tighten your belt and not try to cheer yourself up by wasting large sums of money on things you don’t really need. You may be expecting to come into some cash but don’t start spending it before it has actually arrived. ,cancer,You will find it difficult to keep your nose out of other people’s business today – in fact you seem driven to know as much about everything, and everyone, as you possibly can. You know what curiosity did to the proverbial cat, don’t you? ,cancer,What have you done to turn certain people against you? It may have something to do with your tendency to tell the truth when they don’t want to hear the truth. Yes, of course, they asked for your opinion but did you really think they wanted it? ,cancer,There is no point sticking to a rigid plan of action over the next 48 hours because that will limit your options too much. In fact you are advised to have no plan at all. You will find it easy to act quickly and decisively. ,cancer,Do something unexpected over the next few days, something that takes others by surprise. Monday’s Sun-Uranus link will make it easy for you to break rules with style, which means you are far more likely to get away with it. ,cancer,The planets indicate quite strongly that it would be wiser to give ground now, even about something you feel strongly about, because it will put you in a winning position later on. Think long-term – aim to win the war, not just the battle.
cancer,You may be a small cog in the machine but you are a very important cog, so keep doing what you are doing and keep believing that your input makes a difference. Remember though that a job well done is a job you should also be paid for. ,cancer,You won’t be as distant emotionally as you have been of late and that’s good. It is sometimes difficult for even those closest to you to know what your true feelings are but for a while at least you will be more open and loving. ,cancer,Listen carefully to what friends, colleagues and loved ones have to tell you over the next 24 hours because they can see the bigger picture while you can only see small bits of it. Can they be trusted? Yes they can.
cancer,What seemed like a setback yesterday will be seen in a much more positive light today. Your attitude toward success will change today and over the weekend. There is no reason at all to be embarrassed if you find fame and fortune.
cancer,You would benefit from getting out and about more over the next few days. Short trips are lucky for you now, although they won’t be without their ups and downs. The important thing is that you are visible. Get yourself noticed this weekend. ,cancer,Duties and responsibilities have taken up a great deal of your time in recent weeks but when the Sun changes signs on the 23rd you will find it easier to please yourself for a change. Tie up as many loose ends as possible between now and then. ,cancer,You can now start to give form to a dream that you have been carrying round in the back of your brain for many years. It might be outrageous by some people’s standards but it’s what you want to do and no one can stop you.
cancer,Pay no attention to any rumors you might hear today because they mean nothing. If certain people want to spread gossip that’s up to them but it won’t do you any good, so keep your distance and make sure you deal only in facts.
cancer,Whatever challenges you face over the next few days you will deal with each and every one of them with ease. On the work front, especially, your confidence is so high at the moment that even so-called superiors will come to you for advice. ,cancer,The Sun’s move into the most dynamic area of your chart tomorrow will coincide with a surge of confidence on your part, and because you look at life in a more positive way others will be more upbeat too. Fun times are coming. ,cancer,Some of the thoughts you’ve been having of late have been a bit strange but don’t worry about it, you are not going mad. All that is happening is that your mind is beginning to explore things it either rejected or never noticed before.
cancer,The advice you receive from a friend may be well meaning but deep down you know it is wrong, so go your own way and do your own thing and, above all, listen only to that little voice inside your head – it knows the answers that matter.
cancer,You won’t hesitate to speak your mind as the new week begins but be careful. Tomorrow’s full moon warns if you stray too far from the facts you could be the one who is the topic of conversation – and what others say won’t be pleasant! ,cancer,The Sun in your fellow Water sign of Scorpio does wonders for your confidence but today’s full moon warns you must not get carried away. Over the next 24 to 48 hours try to limit your activities to areas where you know what you are doing. ,cancer,Your confidence may be high at the moment but don’t let that lull you into a false sense of security. It would be nice to believe that the world consists only of generous, compassionate people but you know it’s not true. Watch your back. ,cancer,The last few days have been good for you and the next few days could and should be even better, especially if you have the courage to follow your instincts. Ignore those who say that what you are trying to do is likely to end in tears.
cancer,Get out and about and have a good time this evening and over the weekend. You will find it easy to meet new people and make new friends and, through them, to attract new opportunities. The more you socialize the more you will accomplish.
cancer,You won’t be able to keep your thoughts to yourself this weekend, and why should you when you have so much to say? Anyone who has been taking liberties will soon realize their mistake. Say what you have to say and say it loud. ,cancer,You may well decide to appeal to a higher authority figure over the next few days. You may not like going above the heads of friends and colleagues but if it is the only way to get what you need then what choice do you have? ,cancer,There are some things you can do on your own and some things that have to be done in partnership with other people. What happens today will draw a clear, thick line between the two and you ignore that line at your peril.
cancer,It should be easy to get your message across today as the people you deal with, both in your personal life and at work, seem much more receptive. The only danger is that once you start talking you may not be able to stop!,cancer,Try not to expect too much of yourself today because it is highly unlikely that you will get much done. Saturn’s influence warns you need to take better care of your health. Why not just take it easy over the next 24 hours?,cancer,Sometimes the best way to break bad news is to come right out with it. If you try to let others down gently today it could prolong the agony and may even turn them against you. Get it over with: say what has to be said.
cancer,It may feel as if you have a mountain to climb, and maybe you have, but don’t doubt for a moment that you will reach the top. You have what it takes to succeed and, just as importantly, you have powerful people on your side. Use them. ,cancer,Your ability to stay calm under pressure will win you some admirers this weekend. The fact that you brought the pressure on yourself is immaterial – you will be seen as the kind of person who can be trusted to get things done. ,cancer,You feel that anything and everything is possible. It’s great that your confidence is back but you are advised to wait a few more days before making your big move. The new moon on Wednesday will bring the opportunity you have been waiting for.
cancer,Try not to dwell on your mistakes as they are not that important. What happens over the next few days, especially when the moon in new on Wednesday, will help you make a success of your endeavors, so be positive at all times.
cancer,Do you tell a friend what they want to hear or what they need to hear? It’s up to you, of course, but sometimes it’s best to get bad news over with quickly. Don’t worry too much about their feelings – they’ll get over it.
cancer,The omens are so good for you now that you may be tempted to rush in and start many new things. That would be a mistake. Use the power of today’s new moon to focus on one particular area of endeavor. Aim to be the very best. ,cancer,A loved one or relative has been a real pain recently but you have an obligation to help them, even when their troubles are self-inflicted. You will be called on to make even more sacrifices over the next few days. Do so willingly.
cancer,You have been rather generous in recent weeks, both with your time and your money, but as from today you have to put your own needs first. The planets warn that you must not give to others what you need for yourself. ,cancer,You have to make what appears to be a difficult choice but if you look at the situation with a clear head you will realize it is no choice at all. If you find yourself torn between your family and your work you must put loved ones first. ,cancer,You are right to be skeptical about what you are told but don’t take it to extremes and start to believe that everyone is out to deceive you. If someone offers to help you out in some way this week most likely their generosity is genuine.
cancer,If you want a job done well today you will need to do it yourself. Also, don’t listen to what the so-called experts tell you because their advice is likely to be misleading. You have enough knowledge and enough know-how to do it yourself. ,cancer,Don’t let other people’s cautious ways hold you back from trying something new. Cancer is a cardinal sign and taking chances pays off for you more often than not, so follow your instincts and if others doubt you, well, they won’t for long. ,cancer,You may be in the mood to change things but don’t go too far and make changes that are not necessary. Focus on your home situation and put that to rights before turning your attention to anything else. You may find nothing else needs to be done.
cancer,You are not a trivial person so don’t do or say trivial things. It may be tempting to come down to someone else’s level to make a point but why lower yourself? You don’t need to punish them: their own negative attitude is punishment enough. ,cancer,If you bring what you have been working on to a conclusion over the next two or three days you will have accomplished something truly worthwhile. The Sun in Scorpio in recent weeks unleashed the creative side of your nature – now enjoy the rewards.
cancer,As the Sun moves out of the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend you should start to take things a bit easier than you have done of late. Put your health first and pace yourself sensibly. Wherever possible get others to do the heavy stuff.
cancer,Little things can mean a lot, so don’t overlook details that may seem minor now but could be of major significance later on. Even the smallest of causes can result in major consequences, so make sure you know what is going on.
cancer,Try to be more serious about what you own and what you earn, but not so serious that you forget about everything else. Dollars and cents are important, of course, but only as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. ,cancer,If someone you thought you could trust has been telling tales about you behind your back then by all means cut your links with them. But make sure you know all the facts first – you don’t want to break up a friendship for no good reason. ,cancer,Your mind may be full of wonderful ideas but will you be able to make something out of the ordinary of them? Never doubt that you have what it takes to succeed. Of course, you won’t know for sure until you try – so get on with it! ,cancer,There is no limit to how far you can travel and how much you can do. Where work and money matters are concerned this is the ideal time to push yourself just a little bit harder because the extra effort will pay off in the long-term.
cancer,You do not have the right to force other people to change their ways. You can try to persuade them, of course, but they must also be free to make their own mistakes. Life is a learning experience and we learn most from the things we get wrong. ,cancer,If you have fallen out with someone in recent weeks this would be a good time to let them know you want to be friends again. You have so much in common and there is so much you can achieve together that you really should kiss and make up. ,cancer,People you deal with on a one-to-one level may have the upper hand at the moment but it won’t last. Bide your time and wait until you can see an opportunity to do something by yourself, something that will showcase your talents. Then act.
cancer,Your time is precious and you must not waste it. And you certainly must not let other people waste it. You need to focus all your energy – mental, physical and emotional – on creative activities that mean something to you. Forget about other people. ,cancer,Whatever others might say or do today you must rise above petty things and focus only on positive words and deeds. Even if they seek to get ahead at your expense you must not go looking for revenge. Everything balances out in the end. ,cancer,Don’t take what others tell you too seriously today. It could be their comments are genuine but it is just as likely they are saying what they think you would like to hear. You don’t need flattery – you know how amazing you are. ,cancer,There may be many things you want to change in your life but this isn’t the right time to experiment. According to the planets the most important thing now is that you consolidate what you have got rather than go out and get something more. ,cancer,You may struggle to stay on top of your workload today but the fact is the deadlines you have set yourself are unnecessary ­ no one will think less of you if you fail to meet them. Don’t make a big effort if you don’t feel like it.
cancer,No matter how much of a loner you may be you must make an effort to work closely with people this weekend. Anything done as part of a team will go well but anything you do on your own will fall flat. Be sociable – and succeed.
cancer,With Mars so strong in your chart at the moment you are likely to lock horns with someone who seems rude and antagonistic for no good reason. By all means be rude and antagonistic in return. Chances are it’s the only language they understand. ,cancer,Cosmic activity in your fellow Water sign of Scorpio gives you the kind of can-do attitude that will get jobs finished and impress important people. But no matter how ambitious you may be you still need to find time to remind loved ones how much you care.
cancer,There is no point trying to reason with certain people because whatever you say they will disagree with you. It may annoy you that they are so stubborn in their views but if you think about it you will realize that you too are like that sometimes. ,cancer,You will meet someone who attracts you today and while there may be nothing outwardly special about them on an inner level you just seem to fit together. Are you soul mates? Maybe, maybe not, but you are certainly on the same wavelength. ,cancer,You know that you have what it takes to succeed but others may need some convincing. As from today you will find it much easier to persuade colleagues and employers to take you more seriously. Just remember that actions count more than words. ,cancer,It’s unlikely you will be impressed by someone’s aggressive attitude over the next 24 hours. Do not, however, try to confront them because very soon your relationship will be back to normal again. They just got out of the wrong side of bed this morning. ,cancer,You seem to possess an inner quality that draws others to you like moths to a flame. Hopefully they won’t get burnt by your brilliance and hopefully you won’t devote yourself to their needs entirely. Remember to do something for yourself occasionally.
cancer,Even if you are the kind of Cancer who usually keeps your thoughts to yourself you will be rather vocal today, especially if you believe your interests are at risk. Just make sure you don’t say the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time.
cancer,You may be tempted to call the bluff of those you are negotiating with and hold out for a better offer but the planets warn that is not a good idea. You would be wise to seal the deal on the terms being offered. It’s unlikely they will improve.
cancer,It is even more important than usual to avoid stressful situations, especially if you are the kind of Cancer who gets upset when things go wrong. Work is important, and so is money, but nothing can be allowed to put your health at risk. ,cancer,Have the confidence to try something different today, something that pushes back the boundaries of what you think of as possible. Where both money and work are concerned you should be ready to take the kind of chances you would usually try hard to avoid. ,cancer,Keep your opinions to yourself over the next 24 hours. There is no point trying to persuade other people to see things your way because they can’t – it is simply beyond them. Go your own way and do your own thing. You don’t need public support. ,cancer,When the Sun moves into your opposite sign of Capricorn a few days from now you will be at the halfway point of your solar year, making it a good time to take stock of how far you have come. Between now and then get plenty of rest.
cancer,You will have to confront an emotionally painful situation over the next 48 hours but you know it will only get worse if you don’t act now. If a partnership of some kind has come to the end of the road you must be ruthless and finish it.
cancer,As the Sun joins Mercury in your opposite sign this week you will find yourself having to deal with partnership situations that require a more subtle approach than you usually employ. Try always to see things from the other person’s point of view. ,cancer,You need to let go of something you have come to rely on too much. You don’t need an emotional crutch to get you through life, you just need to stand on your own two feet and work your way slowly but surely toward your long-term goal.
cancer,You need to get over any sense of embarrassment you might feel at revealing your innermost feelings. Even if you are the kind of Cancerian who keeps your emotions in check you will want to share what is in your heart with those you care for. ,cancer,Surprises are likely over the next few days, so brace yourself for changes that come out of the blue. You may not have much control over what is taking place in your life at the moment, but that does not mean you won’t enjoy it.
cancer,An emotional looking full moon in your sign over the next 48 hours means you cannot trust your feelings. Things will go easier for you if you refuse to get upset no matter what the provocation might be. It’s how you react that matters.
cancer,Something will happen today or over the weekend that reminds you how important it is to take care of your health. No matter how robust you may be physically there is also a mental and emotional aspect to your wellbeing that must not be ignored.
cancer,Check the small print, then check it again, before agreeing to anything that might cost you money if you get it wrong. You cannot be too careful when dealing with people this weekend, even if you have dealt with them successfully many times before.
cancer,Try not to lose sight of the bigger picture over the coming week. Step back now and again from what you are doing and make sure you don’t drift off course. Also, don’t let anyone undermine your confidence. You CAN still be a success.
cancer,The more others say that you are aiming too high the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. There is nothing you like more than a challenge but don’t get so competitive that you start treating your friends as rivals. They’re not!,cancer,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn makes it seem as if everyone is ganging up on you, but appearances can be deceptive. No matter how hard done by you may feel over the next 24 hours just stay calm and let the storm pass. ,cancer,You may not feel much like pushing yourself today and that’s fine – don’t. No one can deny that if anyone has earned a break from their labors it is you. So get yourself a mug of something hot, sit back and watch the world go by. ,cancer,If you say or do the wrong thing today you could make an enemy of someone who should have been a friend. Think before you speak or act and make sure your words and deeds are not in any way offensive to people in positions of authority. ,cancer,Do you push the limits as far as you can or do you take a more cautious approach in 2016? That is the question you are faced with now and the fact is there is no right or wrong answer. How you act is your choice and your responsibility.
cancer,Stick to the facts this weekend, because if you exaggerate even a little bit your rivals will make a big deal of it. Why would you want to make yourself look bigger or better anyway? You are who you are and that’s all you need to be.
cancer,Whatever plans you made six months or so ago will start to bear fruit now that Mars is moving into sympathetic Scorpio. Romantically, too, this is a time when you can take things to a higher level – IF you make the required effort.
cancer,You have finally realized that a certain individual is no good for you, and now you have come to your senses you must let them know in no uncertain terms that your association is finished. Don’t worry about hurting their feelings – it’s your feelings that matter. ,cancer,Someone new will come into your life over the next few days. Whether or not the friendship stands the test of time remains to be seen but even if it is short-lived it will give you an emotional lift and help restore your faith in human nature,cancer,Don’t allow others to speak on your behalf today because if you do there is a very good chance they will say something that causes you problems later on. Take responsibility for your own thoughts and beliefs – and always speak from the heart. ,cancer,The Sun is at odds with Uranus, planet of changes, and in some way or other it will shock you out of your complacency. For too long you have coasted along doing as little as you could get away with. Now you must live up to your potential. ,cancer,There is more to a situation than meets the eye, so don’t get carried away and start making claims and accusations that cannot be backed up by facts. Both in your personal life and at work the planets warn you need to be extra careful.
cancer,No matter how ambitious you may be the planets urge you to slow down and relax. It would seem you have reached the point of diminishing returns, where the effort you put in is no longer matched by the rewards you get back, so why push yourself? ,cancer,If a friend or family member makes a suggestion today don’t reject it out of hand. It may not fit in exactly with what you desire but maybe they can see your situation better than you can see it yourself. Act on their advice.
cancer,If you find yourself in a favorable position today then you must take full advantage of it. Don’t miss out on a wonderful opportunity simply because you think it would be wrong to do well for yourself while others are struggling. Go for it.
cancer,You won’t have any trouble today persuading others to back your ideas but you may have some trouble later on if they don’t work out as expected. Both at home and at work you are advised not to make promises you may be unable to keep. ,cancer,Like it or not you don’t have the last say in what’s going on at the moment. What can you do about it? Not a lot to be honest, but it’s no big deal. The cosmic wheel will turn again and one day soon you’ll be calling the shots. ,cancer,Someone you work or do business with may use unfair methods and tactics but you don’t have to lower your standards to keep up. You may be at a disadvantage in the short-term but over time your reputation for honesty will work in your favor. ,cancer,Your powers of persuasion are usually very good but they may fail you over the next 24 hours. Chances are you are trying too hard to convince others that you know what you are talking about, and that makes them suspicious. Aim to be a little less forceful.
cancer,An issue needs to be brought into the open where it can be dealt with. If you are wise you will initiate the discussion yourself because that will allow you to set the terms of the debate, which means you are more likely to win.
cancer,Because the Sun has been moving through your opposite sign of Capricorn some people have been rather demanding in recent weeks. But others have come to your rescue time and again, and now it’s your turn to do something good for them.
cancer,If your body is sending you signals that it could do with a rest then you must heed the call. Not even a Cancer can keep up the relentless pace of the past few weeks, so give yourself a break. If you fall behind in your schedule, that’s too bad.
cancer,You will find it easy to make the kind of difficult decisions that most people prefer to avoid. But you’re not most people, you’re a Cancer, and that means you possess not just the ability to identify a problem but also to do something about it.
cancer,You may feel a bit left out of things today but don’t take it too seriously because all that is happening is that you are sending out subconscious signals that you want to be left alone. You have a lot to think about and you can’t think in a crowd.
cancer,How can you make your home life more enjoyable? One way is to put work matters to the back of your mind and focus on family to the exclusion of everything else. Making a profit is okay but making loved ones happy is priceless. ,cancer,If you don’t feel like pushing yourself today, physically, mentally or emotionally, then don’t. In fact if you are given the choice between doing more and doing less, you should choose the latter without hesitation. You’ve done your bit already.
cancer,There is so much going right in your life at the moment that it will take a lot to burst your bubble – but, wouldn’t you know it, someone will try. They will only succeed if you let them, so keep smiling and keep the good times rolling.
cancer,This week’s full moon will make you either too generous or too selfish – there is no middle ground. If others approach you for a handout promise them you will think about it and get back to them later. Chances are they will go and leech off someone else.
cancer,You will have to put up with a number of petty criticisms today but words can’t harm you so don’t take them seriously. Others can talk big if they wish but actions always speak louder than words. What is your next move going to be?,cancer,A problem you have tried to deal with by pretending it does not exist will come back at you again today and this time you must do something about it. You must be prepared to do whatever it takes to change your life for the better.
cancer,You know you are capable of doing more and the planets indicate that the right opportunity will come along at just the right moment. Take it easy and take your time – and be ready to take your big chance when it finally arrives. ,cancer,Cosmic activity in the partnership area of your chart means you have to be ruthless with those who seem to get a kick out of making life difficult for you. Both in your personal life and in your work don’t be afraid to cut ties that hold you back. ,cancer,Do you feel lucky? Maybe you do but the planets warn that your feelings may not be the best guide to reality, so err on the side of caution today. To put it bluntly: if you gamble you will most likely lose. Why take the chance? ,cancer,It may at times seem as if the world is a cold, uncaring place but that is not true and what happens this weekend will convince you of that fact. Every time someone does something good for you do something good for the next person you meet.
cancer,If someone is obstructive for no good reason this week you might like to ask yourself if maybe you have said or done something to upset them. It may be the kind of thing that means nothing to you but stop, think and, if necessary, say sorry.
cancer,Work-related issues won’t be such a trial as they have been of late. In fact, you will make a positive impression on employers and other important people today, simply by being yourself and letting your natural goodness and talent shine through. ,cancer,There are times when your suspicions are well founded and the planets warn you are right to be doubtful – this is not a good time to commit yourself to anything that you cannot easily get out of later. What’s the rush? There’s always tomorrow.
cancer,You need to stop wasting time and energy on activities that do not pay. You can start today by turning down a social invitation that you know is of no importance. Don’t worry that they won’t ever invite you again – that’s something to be thankful for. ,cancer,Someone you live or work with needs your support and maybe a shoulder to cry on and being the nice Cancer you are you will do what you can to assist them. It may be emotionally draining but you have been through this kind of scene many times before. ,cancer,According to the planets you are on the verge of something big, something that will bring fame and maybe fortune too. Others can sense this change and want to be close to you so some of the glory rubs off on them. There’s plenty to go round.
cancer,It’s time to bring a feud to an end. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn will help you take a long-term view of your needs and what you need most is the assistance of those you work and do business with – so no more disputes.
cancer,Don’t sit there hoping that someone will see you need help – let family and friends know you are finding things difficult. They will remember all the times you have helped them in the past and go out of their way to pay you back.
cancer,You cannot let go of a thought or an idea and it is driving you crazy. The good news is that today’s new moon will help you find a way to apply it in the real world and, once you have done that, it won’t bother you again.
cancer,The weather in your neck of the cosmic woods may get a bit blowy over the next 24 hours but the long-term forecast is good, so sit tight and ride out the storm. Come the weekend your world will be a brighter and sunnier place. ,cancer,Loved ones have not been quite so helpful of late but only because they had a lot on their plate. Today, however, they will go right the other way and give you as much attention as you need. Show your appreciation. There’s no point holding a grudge.
cancer,It does not matter what others think, it matters only what your instincts tell you and they tell you “don’t panic”. Others can run around like headless chickens if they so wish but you know the best thing to do is to sit tight and wait. ,cancer,If you need assistance today all you have to do is ask. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters. Joint financial enterprises are now under excellent stars and will be for quite some time, so get a partner and get rich! ,cancer,You can force through changes if you wish over the next 48 hours but is that really such a wise move? You may win in the short-term but it will also create a lot of ill feeling in the long-term. Persuasion is always better than coercion.
cancer,You are trying too hard to change something when all you have to do is sit back and let fate change it for you. Everything that happens in your life is part of a cosmic plan. Don’t fight that plan – instead, tune in to it and follow it.
cancer,You should be feeling more positive about life now and if you are still feeling down then you really must get out and about more. Mix with people who are cheerful and chatty – it won’t be long before their good mood rubs off on you. ,cancer,What happens over the next few days should ease your money troubles, so stop worrying about how you are going to make ends meet and let fate take its course. Your luck is about to turn but make sure you are the one who gets the benefits. ,cancer,You know that you are in the right and you know that no one can stop you from following the path that you have chosen to take. So why do you still hesitate? The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will boost your confidence no end, so go for it! ,cancer,The Sun’s change of signs will lead to a broadening of your horizons and ideas that never meant much to you in the past will capture your imagination. Some of them may be a little “way out” but the important thing is you are using your mind. ,cancer,Don’t take what others say too seriously, especially if it is you they are talking about. They clearly have no idea what you are up to or what your motives might be and nor are you going to tell them. A little bit of secrecy is no bad thing.
cancer,Your movements will be restricted over the next 24 hours but don’t make a big issue of it. Delays and disruptions may be inevitable but feeling bad about them is not – that is a matter of personal choice. Instead of moving, why not just enjoy where you are?,cancer,Today’s full moon will in some way or other force you to do the opposite of what you were planning. There is no point making a big scene about it – just get on and do what is expected of you, and do it well. ,cancer,You know from bitter experience that if you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one, so aim to please the one person who truly matters – yourself. This is one of those days when your generosity will be taken for granted, so don’t waste it.
cancer,Forget about duty and routine and focus on the one thing that means the most to you. As a trustworthy Cancer you always do what is expected of you but now you must free the creative side of your nature, even if it means breaking a few rules. ,cancer,Over the next 24 hours you must act on the assumption that what others tell you may not be the truth. It does not matter how good a deal you are being offered, if there is the slightest doubt in your mind you must turn it down. ,cancer,You will have to make a number of quick decisions over the next 24 hours and they are more likely to be correct decisions if you trust what your instincts tell you. Don’t worry if some people make fun of your ideas. The joke is on them.
cancer,Set yourself a challenge and commit yourself to a goal that others say is beyond your reach. With the Sun moving through one of the more dynamic areas of your chart there is nothing you cannot do. Go all out to prove the doubters wrong.
cancer,As a Water sign you see deeper and further than most other people and what you discover about the nature of reality over the next few days will astound and delight you. The world is not only a beautiful place, it has meaning too.
cancer,Don’t just believe what other people tell you today – find out about it for yourself. Most likely you will quickly see through their lies and distortions and arrive at a truth that is very different to what they wanted you to believe.
cancer,You know from bitter experience that if you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one, so aim to please the one person who truly matters – yourself. This is one of those days when your generosity will be taken for granted, so don’t waste it.
cancer,People are depending on you, so stay calm and stay focused on what needs to be done. The good news is you won’t have to do it alone: someone will offer to help you today and together you can put things right. You make an excellent team.
cancer,You may be tempted to tear down something it took you a lot of time and effort to build, simply because it is not up to the high standards you set for yourself, but the planets warn you will regret it if you do. Stop being so hard on yourself.
cancer,You may be tired from the constant running around you have been doing but you are also pleased by the progress you have made. You will make more progress today if you slow down a bit and concentrate on one specific aim. Think quality, not quantity.
cancer,With mind planet Mercury joining the Sun in one of the best areas of your chart this weekend your confidence will receive a boost. Just be careful you don’t overestimate your abilities and take on too much, too soon. There’s no need to rush.
cancer,You must be honest with yourself about your desires. You can no longer pretend that certain things mean nothing to you when, deep down, you secretly crave them. That craving will reach a crescendo this week. Maybe you should just give in to it.
cancer,You are in an adventurous mood at the moment and will want to explore further afield than usual. Just be careful you don’t stray into areas where you do not know your way around. And always be aware of the quickest route out!,cancer,Is it possible to have too much of a good thing? Yes it is, so be careful over the next few days. Cosmic activity in your fellow water sign of Pisces indicates some really fun times – but if you go too far you may regret it health-wise.
cancer,A solar eclipse in the sympathetic sign of Pisces marks the start of a more productive phase but to make the most of it you have got to think clearly. Your intuition is important, of course, but for the next few days you must focus only on facts.
cancer,If you feel stuck in the same old place, with the same old people, doing the same old things then clearly you need to break free. A vacation is a good idea, but even if you cannot travel right now you can start making plans. Make them big! ,cancer,Something you see or hear will get you thinking along new lines and there is no telling in which direction your thoughts will take you. It’s time to leave your comfort zone and explore new possibilities. There’s a world out there waiting to be discovered.
cancer,The less you reveal about yourself the more others will be drawn to your mysterious nature. There may, of course, be no real mystery at all – as a Cancer you like to keep yourself to yourself because that’s just how you are. But they don’t know that.
cancer,It is important that you know your limits, because with Mercury at right angles to Saturn as the new week begins there is a danger you will bite off more than you can chew. Remember too that you are not and never will be perfect – and that’s okay.
cancer,Some tough decisions will have to be made this week but you are tough enough to make them. Cancer is a cardinal sign and among other things that means you are not afraid to move in a completely new direction. So move – fast!,cancer,Others may say that something cannot be done but just because it is too much for them does not mean it is too much for you. The planets urge you to reach out to the world, to embrace what is new and exciting. Don’t let fear hold you back. ,cancer,You know you are destined for bigger and better things but knowing alone is not enough, you have got to actually make them happen. Opportunities for advancement are coming your way but what you do with them is for you to decide. ,cancer,Believe it or not you are under fortunate stars at the moment but your negative attitude is making things look worse than they are. A difficult situation will work itself out for the best over the next 24 hours, so don’t give in to doom and gloom. ,cancer,The Sun crosses the career angle of your chart on Sunday, so it won’t be long before you get the chance to move up in the world. But don’t be tempted to cut corners or use underhand methods to hurry things along. You really don’t need them. ,cancer,If you have got an opinion about something make sure the world knows about it over the next 48 hours. Yes, you may upset a few people but so what? It’s time someone stood up and pointed out a few home truths. That someone is you.
cancer,You want to show the world what you are capable of but don’t come on so strong that you frighten people off – or turn them against you. The Sun in Aries at this time of year makes you intensely ambitious but don’t get carried away. ,cancer,The Sun’s journey through the career area of your chart over the next few weeks will bring new opportunities but you have got to be willing to take a few risks. Fate will point you in the right direction – all you have to do is march.
cancer,If an opportunity to move up in the world comes your way you must seize it with both hands. Don’t worry that you don’t have the qualifications or the experience. What matters is that you have the drive and the ambition to be a success. ,cancer,If you go looking for a fight today you will find it – but chances are you will end up on the losing side. The planets warn you could find yourself up against someone who is bigger and tougher than you. The results could be painful. ,cancer,Someone in a position of authority will rub you up the wrong way today but you must not let their negative attitude get to you. Life is full of annoying people and petty challenges – which you can use to improve your self-control. ,cancer,You may be tempted to change your job or start a new career path but don’t be hasty. Stay where you are for the time being and wait to see how the situation develops. According to the planets you may not have to change anything at all. ,cancer,The planets warn that although what you hear today might sound reasonable it is in fact a very long way from the truth. Question everything you are told. You don’t have to believe claims just because they come from people in positions of power.
cancer,The answer to the problem you are struggling with is actually quite simple and when you see what it is you will kick your own backside for being so blind. But don’t be too hard on yourself. Your thinking has been a bit muddled of late.
cancer,Why are you trying to change your personality? You are who you are for a reason, even if you are not sure what that reason might be. A leopard cannot change its spots and you will always be a likeable, loveable Cancer at heart. Be proud of that. ,cancer,This is a great time for a clear-out but make sure you don’t get rid of items that may still be worth something. Yes, there is a lot of junk in your life but there are still some things that you should hold on to for a while.
cancer,If you go out of your way to impress people in positions of authority they will go out of their way to help you realize your ambitions. But don’t confuse “success” with “excess” because if you go too far you could end making more enemies than friends.
cancer,Use your persuasive skills to convince important people that you want to be on their side, and that they should be on your side too. Ask yourself what you can do to convince them. Do whatever it takes to win them around.
cancer,There will rarely be a better time to make a good impression on people in positions of authority. Whatever you say today will be looked on favorably, so if you’ve got some big ideas now is the time to make them known.
cancer,Loved ones will be rather touchy today, so watch what you say and the way that you say it. What seems like an innocent remark to you could be taken the wrong way and before you know it you will have a feud on your hands.
cancer,Speak and act from the heart. Don’t keep your feelings to yourself. It may not come naturally to you to open up but you can do it if you try and you must try if you are to win round the one who means the most to you. ,cancer,You may have your suspicions that someone is trying to cheat you but don’t go making accusations without evidence to back up your claims. That applies as much to your personal life as it does to your work. Deal only with facts. ,cancer,You may experience a sudden loss of confidence this weekend but it won’t last long, so don’t let it worry you. The planets promise that come the start of next week your mood will be on the up again, so why look so sad? ,cancer,If you are typical of your sign you may be thinking of changing your job, or even your entire career path. Others may be shocked that you are ready to give up what you have worked so hard to achieve but if it feels right for you – do it.
cancer,Pay attention to the little things over the next few days. You may be super confident at the moment but the planets warn you could easily overlook important facts and figures. Check, check and then check again, to be on the safe side.
cancer,According to the planets you can do no wrong at the moment. There is a definite luck factor working in your favor, but how much you get out of it depends a great deal on your attitude. Banish all thoughts of self-doubt. Believe in yourself.
cancer,Leave your doubts and fears behind and do something special, something that gets you noticed. It may be that certain people are hoping you break the rules so they can take you down a peg or two, but you’re too smart to let that happen. ,cancer,There will be no stopping you over the next 24 hours – you will be a winner both in affairs of the heart and in matters of business. However, try not to over-indulge. Just because you can have it all does not mean you must have it all. ,cancer,You know you need to make more of the talents you were born with, but how? The Sun’s change of signs on the 19th will point you in the right direction. There is no limit to what you can accomplish but you have got to really want it.
cancer,You will go out of your way this weekend to make sure others cannot see how much you are hurting inside. Is that really such a good idea? If you don’t want to hurt so much then let them know that what they are doing is wrong.
cancer,You may now regret some of the things you said or did but there is really no need. All experience is good experience even when it appears to be bad, so don’t worry. If you feel that you have wronged someone you will get the chance to make amends.
cancer,It is possible you will lose your temper and say things you later wish you had not. On the other hand, certain people may need to be reminded that you are not as easygoing or as easy to fool as they might imagine. Be loud about it.
cancer,If you give yourself permission to dream you will discover that your hopes and wishes start to come true. The power of the mind is a remarkable thing. If you think it can happen it will happen, maybe a lot sooner than you expected. ,cancer,Try not to get too involved in other people’s affairs today. That may be easier said than done but once you are in the full moon will make it hard to get out again. Keep your distance unless you absolutely cannot say no.
cancer,If you have something to hide you may find that it becomes public knowledge this weekend, much to your embarrassment. The best way to deal with the situation is to brazen it out. Put on an act and pretend you don’t care. ,cancer,You need to keep a clear divide between you and other people’s emotional problems. You may think you can help but the planets warn they are determined to wallow in their own self-pity – in a strange way it makes them feel better about themselves. ,cancer,Something will change unexpectedly over the next few days and whether you see that as good news or bad news depends on your outlook. Once you realize that change is inevitable you can start working with it, and life will be a lot more enjoyable. ,cancer,You want to do something spectacular, something that will leave no one, not even your critics, in any doubt that your talents are real and should be recognized. Don’t just do it for shock value though – it must be something that benefits others too. ,cancer,You may think you can help a friend who is confused in some way but the planets warn that once you get involved in their fantasies you may not be able to get yourself out again. Stick to reality Cancer – yes, it’s boring, but it’s safer too!,cancer,This is a good time for travel and social activities, so don’t sit there wondering why life seems to be passing you by, get up and get busy. A special friend will become even more special if you include them in your plans.
cancer,By all means talk yourself up a bit, but don’t exaggerate your achievements. The people who matter in your life are well aware of who you are and what you can do. As for everyone else – what they think does not matter in the slightest. ,cancer,Luck is what you make of it and if you are ready to move at a moment’s notice this weekend there is every chance that you will benefit both romantically and financially. Friends and loved ones will go out of their way to make you happy.
cancer,Your future has rarely looked brighter but there is still this doubt in the back of your mind that it could still all fall apart. You really need to get over it, not least because those sort of thoughts can sometimes be self-fulfilling.
cancer,New people will come into your life over the next few days and some of them may seem a little strange. But that’s okay because you like people who are different. You want to be friends with everyone – well, maybe not everyone, but most people.
cancer,There are times when you need to be alone with your thoughts but today you will go in the opposite direction and let the whole world know what is going on inside your head. Whether the world needs or wants to know is another matter! ,cancer,You may feel energetic at the moment but you still need to pace yourself sensibly. If you don’t you will be exhausted well before the weekend. Prioritize your targets and make sure you stick to them. And remember: quality counts above quantity.
cancer,It’s time to move on, so draw a line under the past and forget about everything that went before – it no longer matters. What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so don’t waste time on regrets. It’s what you do next that counts. ,cancer,The doubts that have been holding you back will fade away over the next few days. You may even come to the conclusion that there was no real reason to worry at all. The sense of relief you feel will give you a surge of new energy.
cancer,Are your goals reasonable and attainable or are you expecting too much of yourself? You need to stand back from your life over the next 48 hours so you can get an overview of who you are and what it is you should be doing. ,cancer,You are in an optimistic and fun-loving mood at the moment, even though certain people seem determined to make you feel as gloomy as they look. Jupiter in the most outgoing area of your chart makes you impervious to bad news.
cancer,Travel plans and social activities are progressing nicely and with Jupiter on your side again any delays and difficulties you may have been experiencing will quickly disappear. Life will be full of surprises – nice ones – over the next seven days.
cancer,If you get the urge to travel over the next few days you should follow it wherever it leads you. Too often in the past you have been too timid and failed to seize the opportunity when it was there. So, time to get moving! ,cancer,Keep routine tasks to a minimum today because you need to devote more time to impressing a special person you have been trying to get close to for quite some time. You won’t get the chance if you hide yourself behind a mountain of work. ,cancer,If someone tells you that something cannot be done today you will go out of your way to do it, just to prove them wrong. You love a challenge, but can you be sure it isn’t a double bluff? Maybe they actually want you to do it.
cancer,You don’t have to do anything special to have a good time, you just have to be yourself and let other people entertain you. Time spent sitting and chatting with friends will not be time wasted. Weekends are made to take things easy. ,cancer,You may disagree strongly with a colleague’s point of view but don’t let it show. The last thing you want now is to fall out with them as that might jeopardize other plans you have together. Stay calm and refuse to let their comments rile you. ,cancer,Try not to worry about your money situation. It may not be as good as you would like it to be but it won’t be long before you get the chance to boost your income. Wait until you have the cash in your hand before splashing out again.
cancer,At some stage over the next few days you will have to accept that something you’ve been working on for quite some time is no longer worth the effort. Be ruthless and get rid of it altogether. Don’t try to hold on to the past. ,cancer,If you are smart you will think twice before saying something that is likely to make enemies of friends. Stand back a bit and try to se what is going on from a higher perspective. Once you understand the situation you won’t feel the need to be critical.
cancer,The cosmic picture is about to change and in a matter of days you will be in a more positive frame of mind, You won’t be in the mood to do much in the world at large though but that’s okay. Take all the time you need.
cancer,It would appear that someone is trying to blame you for something that is not your fault – and you must not let it happen. Let them know right from the start that you are in no mood to roll over and play dead. Get mad, Cancer!,cancer,Don’t worry that by speaking your mind you will hurt a friend’s feelings. Chances are they are not as weak or as soft as they like to make out. If there is something you need to tell them just open your mouth and let the words come out.
cancer,Do you know how to respect your limits? Do you know when to stop? It’s okay to be assertive but you must not be aggressive this week, because that will turn people against you both at home and at work. You don’t have to win every time.
cancer,Someone you have to deal with on a one-to-one basis may be dragging their feet for no apparent reason but there is no need to get excited about it. Promise yourself that no matter how slow they go you won’t lose your temper!,cancer,Something will catch your eye today and you won’t rest until you possess it. The problem is it may cost more than you can afford, though you won’t realize that until later on. Whatever it is, make sure it has a no-questions-asked return guarantee.
cancer,The more others try to persuade you to do a little bit extra the harder you must resist. If they get the idea that you can be easily manipulated they will have you doing all sorts of things you have not agreed to over the next few days. ,cancer,If you expect the worst you will get the worst as your powerful emotions attract to you the same kind of vibes you give out to the world. It works the other way too though, so strive to be positive at all times and in all things. ,cancer,Yes, there are things you should have done but did not do, and no doubt there are things you did do that you now realize were wrong, but don’t sweat it. There is no reason why you should feel guilty about any of it. You’re only human. ,cancer,You need to face up to a problem that has been giving you sleepless nights. It won’t go away of its own accord so be brave and tackle it head-on. Once you stop playing mind games with yourself you will find a solution. ,cancer,If you find that important decisions to do with money or business are being taken in your name but without your authority you must put your foot down. People will respect you more if you don’t let them get away with too much.
cancer,You will be knocked out of your stride by what a friend or family member has to tell you today. But no matter how outrageously they may have behaved you must back them all the way. They need your support, not more criticism. ,cancer,Your money situation will improve over the next few days and, looking back, you will wonder why you got so worked up about it. The situation might have improved earlier if you had not been so reluctant to take chances and change things.
cancer,There seem to be a lot of disruptions in your life at the moment but the good news is this is only a passing phase. Stay calm and refuse to be worried. Come the weekend everything will be back to how it was before.
cancer,Little things will annoy you today, the kind of things that get in the way of all the important stuff you should be doing. Maybe though you are putting yourself under too much pressure and this is your inner self’s way of telling you to slow down.
cancer,You may be tempted to take a big risk today but before you do give some thought to what you could lose if you get it wrong. If you make a bad call it won’t only affect the money in your wallet but your reputation as well.
cancer,You may be tempted to take a big risk today but before you do give some thought to what you could lose if you get it wrong. If you make a bad call it won’t only affect the money in your wallet but your reputation as well. ,cancer,It may be tempting to give up on a plan or project you once had high hopes for but don’t be too hasty. Something will happen over the next 24 hours that reignites your interest and one big push could be all it takes to get moving again. ,cancer,Something you have been struggling with for ages will come easier over the next 24 hours. The most important thing, of course, is to maintain a positive attitude, because when your confidence is fragile even the smallest setback can upset you.
cancer,You must stay on top of your workload today, because if you let things slide and fall behind you may never catch up. Of course, the best way to get things done is to delegate more. Trust those you work with to do a good job.
cancer,You seem to be under the impression that people in positions of authority want you to be more assertive, but is that true or is it just your own subconscious pushing you to be more ambitious? Whatever the reason, keep it within acceptable limits.
cancer,A partnership issue will come to a head today and you must deal with it quickly and efficiently. Deep down you hoped it would not come to this but now that it has you have no choice but to get tough and get it over with.
cancer,The Sun’s journey through the most sensitive area of your chart means you must make it your priority to get rid of all the emotional junk that is cluttering up your life. The more you tighten things up now the more fun you will have later on. ,cancer,The current cosmic set-up will in some way or other test your attitude towards possessions and other worldly matters. Hopefully it will remind you that there are more important things in life, such as love and laughter and learning to be free.
cancer,You are about to embark on a learning curve that may seem a bit steep, but you can handle it. In fact, a few weeks from now you will look back and realize how much good it did you. Challenges are a blessing, Cancer. ,cancer,The direct approach is the best approach now, especially where partnerships and relationships are concerned. Let others know how you feel and don’t worry that not everyone will be able to return those feelings. As always, what will be will be.
cancer,You know the difference between right and wrong and you know that if you don’t stand up for what you believe you will hate yourself for it. People in positions of power won’t like it, of course, but why should you care about that? ,cancer,How realistic are your daydreams? Probably not realistic in the slightest but that does not mean you should not enjoy them. Your ambitions may be a bit far-fetched but that’s okay. They do at least give you something to aim for. ,cancer,You have the power to make things happen, so don’t waste time seeking other people’s permission or approval, just get on and do what needs to be done. Not everyone will agree with your tactics but why should you care about that? ,cancer,Your life is about to take a turn for the better, and a big turn at that. Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign today and the Sun follows it there early next week. Forget about the past because only the future matters to you now.
cancer,The more you expect of others over the next 48 hours the more disappointed you are likely to be, so don’t get your hopes too high. According to the planets you are making the mistake of believing that everyone is as brilliant as you. ,cancer,The Sun moves into your birth sign tomorrow and a new solar year gets under way. No doubt you are eager to take on the world but for best results you must focus on the two or three goals that mean the most to you. Less is more.
cancer,Keep your thoughts and ideas simple today because if you complicate things now you will probably regret it later. Above all, focus on what’s important to you and don’t waste time on other people’s problems. It’s okay to be a bit selfish.
cancer,Don’t plan anything too serious today because your resistance is likely to be low and you should avoid things that strain you physically or emotionally. You may think you are tough enough to take it but why take the chance when you don’t have to? ,cancer,Whatever obstacles you bump up against today you must act as if they don’t exist. With the Sun now moving through your sign your main enemy is your tendency to negativity, so the only real limits are the ones you impose on yourself.
cancer,With the Sun and Venus in your sign you are sure to achieve something worthwhile. You can also be sure that past efforts will be fully rewarded, if not immediately then certainly by the start of next week. Life is good and about to get even better. ,cancer,The Sun in your sign marks the start of a brand new cycle, a time of new beginnings. If there is something you really, truly desire to do, something you have dreamed about for months, years, maybe even decades, now is the time to make it happen.
cancer,Seek out those who know how to enjoy themselves. The more you surround yourself with people who are positive and progressive the more fun you will have and the more you will accomplish. Get involved on every level: emotionally, socially and professionally.
cancer,What happens today and during the early part of the week will make it clear that no matter how much you try to be fair with certain individuals they will never be fair with you. It’s taken you a long time to learn this lesson, so don’t forget it!,cancer,You will be even more assertive and ambitious than usual this week, and that’s good, but it could cause a few problems if certain people get the impression that you care for nothing but your own greater glory. Even if it’s true, tone down your act a bit. ,cancer,You are imposing too many limits on yourself. At this time of year, with the Sun very much on your side, you should be extending the boundaries of what you can do, not restricting yourself to the tried and trusted. Be more adventurous Cancer.
cancer,You can do no wrong at the moment, at least where affairs of the heart are concerned. Venus in your sign makes you affectionate in the extreme, but be selective. Don’t give everyone you meet the impression that you are madly in love with them! ,cancer,You are torn between doing what you know to be right and what others expect of you. Only you can decide which route to take but don’t kid yourself into believing that if you do things for others they will do things for you, or even be grateful.
cancer,The planets warn that certain people will play on your sympathies and try to get you to do things you would not do in the normal course of events. Anyone who comes to you with a tale of woe today should be subjected to rigorous examination.
cancer,Try not to let your responsibilities weigh you down. You take your duties very seriously but sometimes you go too far and allow them to take over your existence, and that can’t be healthy. Delegate more Cancer, especially on the work front. ,cancer,A new moon in your sign at the start of the week will in some way or other remind you that all things are possible if you desire them enough. Anything you put your mind to now will come about sooner or later – most likely sooner. ,cancer,Your self-belief is so high at the moment that there is no stopping you. Today’s new moon will also give you a new perspective on your long-term aims and ambitions, so don’t hold on too tightly to what you know and trust – be more adventurous. ,cancer,As one of the zodiac’s Water signs you sometimes find it hard to believe what other people tell you and that trait will serve you well today. Mercury, planet of the mind, in your sign means you can see through lies and distortions. ,cancer,If you limit yourself to tried and tested ways over the next few days you will not only make unnecessary work for yourself but you may miss out on something that could have made your life richer and more enjoyable. Move with the times.
cancer,You will learn something over the next 24 hours that helps you make sense of what previously seemed to make no sense at all. What you had dismissed as fantasy or wishful thinking may actually turn out to be true. Stranger things have happened. ,cancer,The more willing you are to work with other people, both in your social sphere and at work, the more likely it is you will share in something amazing. By uniting your efforts you will each enjoy bigger rewards than if you had worked on your own.
cancer,Other people can advise you only so much – at some stage you must make up your own mind and trust that you have made the right decision. Don’t worry. The Sun in your sign, linked to Jupiter, suggests success beyond your wildest dreams.
cancer,There will be times over the coming week when you have so much sensory input to deal with that it all gets a bit much. But don’t worry. This is still your time of year and you will not only find ways to cope but to thrive as well.
cancer,You know that you are in the right and you know that no one is strong enough to stop you from taking the path that you have chosen. So don’t waste time arguing with people who oppose you, just get on and do what has to be done. ,cancer,Chances are you will become more serious about your relationships, and also your money situation, over the next few days. But don’t get so serious that it takes the fun out of life. Life should not be a burden and laughter counts for more than fears.
cancer,You may be eager to get started on something but make sure you plan properly. If you start too quickly you may have to go back later and do it again. A little bit of thought now will save a lot of time and tears later on. ,cancer,As Mercury leaves your sign today you can sense that the focus of your life is about to change, maybe a little, maybe a lot. One thing that will change is your money situation, which you know needs some serious attention.
cancer,Forget about what might have been and focus on what is going to be. Take today, and every day, as it comes and don’t bother looking too far ahead. There is already a plan guiding your life – all you have to do is follow it.
cancer,Forget about duty and forget about routine – focus every fiber of your being on the one thing that means the most to you. The time has come to free the creative side of your nature, even if it means breaking a few out-of-date rules. ,cancer,You were born with a special personality and there is absolutely no reason why you should change your ways, and certainly not to please other people. Be who you are over the coming week and find ways to express your unique gifts. ,cancer,You may not be in the right frame of mind to deal with partnership issues at the moment but there is no need as everything will work out fine in the long-term. If you feel under pressure it is because you are putting yourself under pressure.
cancer,Partners and loved ones won’t be easy to deal with today. The full moon in your opposite sign will stir up everyone’s emotions and there will be more than a few harsh words flying about. But don’t bear grudges – it’s not worth it.
cancer,Someone will feel the sharp edge of your tongue today, and no doubt they deserve it, but later on you may have second thoughts and wish you had not been quite so aggressive. Let them know you don’t hold a grudge. It’s over and done with. ,cancer,The Sun is coming to the end of its journey through your sign but that does not mean your own journey is about to end too. On the contrary, you will be on the move continually over the next few days. But does your movement have a purpose?,cancer,Sometimes the best way to deal with a problem is to ignore it and that seems to be your best option now. The more you are the kind of Cancer who likes to take charge the more you must resist the urge and just go with the flow.
cancer,You’ve had some wonderful ideas of late and one idea in particular thrills you to such an extent that you won’t be satisfied until you have done something about it. Go on, make it your number one aim – and make it pay too.
cancer,Even if you are the kind of Cancer who sees the glass as half empty rather than as half full you will be remarkably positive this week. You’ve got this feeling that you can do no wrong at the moment – and that feeling will make it a reality.
cancer,Just because something has always been done a certain way does not mean you have to do it that way now. Some things start out merely as the latest fashion and over time become accepted as the status quo. Be different. Start your own trend.
cancer,You cannot see the whole picture concerning a money matter or business issue at the moment, so don’t make any snap decisions. The planets may be tempting you to take some kind of risk but you are too smart to throw your money away.
cancer,Everyone wants something from you and everyone wants you on their side. It’s nice to be popular but sometimes it gets a bit too much and you have to distance yourself from the mob. Find a quiet place you can be on your own today. ,cancer,No matter how hard you try you won’t be able to please everyone today. In fact you should go to the other extreme and let others know that you’ve had enough of their petty ways and cannot be bothered with them any more. And mean it. ,cancer,Employers and other important people will be rather demanding today, which in itself is no bad thing, but they will also change their minds every few minutes, which is sure to make you angry. Don’t let your feelings show. Count to ten slowly. ,cancer,The Sun in Leo can have a serious effect on your cashflow situation, so make sure you are in control of the way your money is spent. If you let others make decisions for you over the coming week it could cost you dear. ,cancer,The Sun in Leo can have a serious effect on your cashflow situation, so make sure you are in control of the way your money is spent. If you let others make decisions for you over the coming week it could cost you dear.
cancer,You must now get to grips with a problem that has taken up far too much of your time and your energy. If that means making an unpopular decision then so be it – this is no time to worry what other people might think of you personally.
cancer,Today’s new moon will reward you in ways you may not have been expecting but which you have earned by your endeavors. Money has never been the center of your universe, of course, but it’s right that you should get what you deserve.
cancer,The planets suggest you will achieve more in the long-term if you take it easy over the next few days. Think of your health and pace yourself sensibly. Wherever possible get others to do difficult jobs for you. Give your mind and your body a rest. ,cancer,Don’t allow yourself to get so caught up in other people’s problems that they become your problems too. Give negativity a miss and focus only on the good things in life. No matter what others may say to the contrary you are not responsible for their woes. ,cancer,Whatever duties or chores you may have on your plate at the moment you should forget about them for the next two or three days. Nothing is more important now than having a good time with friends and loved ones. Work less, party more.
cancer,You are not thinking big enough. You are not aiming high enough. You have so much talent but for some strange reason you seem reluctant to use it. Why is that? Whatever the reason it is time to move on and move up. No more second best.
cancer,You will gain more in the long-term if you help others as well as yourself. A good deed done now will pay off in a big way later on, so think before you act and act only in ways that bring smiles to the faces of those around you.
cancer,What happens next may not be entirely to your liking but if you stay calm you can find ways to make it work in your favor. Happiness comes from facing up to difficult circumstances and overcoming them. You are destined to find happiness this week.
cancer,Someone you think of as a rival will surprise you today by sticking up for you against those who want to see you humiliated. Is it some kind of trick? No it is not. You have a lot more in common than you have allowed yourself to see.
cancer,There is a lot of tension in the air at the moment, as if something major is about to happen. Maybe it will and maybe it won’t but fretting about it won’t make any difference. You cannot control events, you can only control yourself.
cancer,Get out and about and have a good time and don’t let anyone tell you that you are being irresponsible for putting work on hold. If you don’t let your hair down today you could get rather uptight. Even Cancer needs to party once in a while.
cancer,There is no need to feel guilty because you don’t get along with a certain individual. The simple fact is you are far too different to ever truly see eye-to-eye, so keep your distance so as to reduce the chances of friction between you. ,cancer,You would be wise not to ignore that nagging feeling in the back of your mind that something is not quite as it should be. Make sure you know what is going on and make sure you control the events of your life, not other people.
cancer,Be careful with your cash over the next few days because you could easily make a costly mistake. What seems like a fantastic money-making idea now could turn out later to be anything but, so don’t let greed get the better of you. ,cancer,Don’t fall into the trap of thinking it is your responsibility to be there each and every time a loved one or friend gets into trouble. They are quite capable of looking after themselves – and are lying if they tell you otherwise.
cancer,The most important thing right now is that your purpose is crystal clear. If you know what it is you are aiming for there is a very good chance you will get it. Others may be able to assist you but ultimately it comes down to your own efforts.
cancer,Be careful what you say because if you say the wrong thing to the wrong person it could negatively impact your cashflow situation. In fact it might be best if you steer clear of money matters altogether over the next two or three days.
cancer,You need to get serious about what you own and what you earn, but not so serious that you forget about everything else. Money is important, of course, but only as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. Love trumps everything else.
cancer,It would appear that you have overlooked a small but important detail and the consequences of that oversight will become apparent over the next 48 hours. Yes, of course, you will have to pay the price but you can easily afford it.
cancer,Take each day as it comes over the coming week and be ready to move in whatever direction fate chooses to point you. Good fortune will come not just from your own efforts but also through the influence of powerful friends.
cancer,Get out and about today and make sure family and friends know what you are up to. Positive influences in the communications area of your chart will make it easy for you to get your message across. Don’t let them pretend they do not understand.
cancer,The planets will make it easy for you to get out and about in the world and meet new people. Even if you are the kind of Cancer who prefers your own company you would be wise to make an effort to be sociable. Smiles cost nothing.
cancer,If you throw yourself into your work today you will get an amazing amount done, but for best results you should work on creative matters rather than everyday chores. Take that big idea you’ve got and turn it into a piece of art that others can enjoy.
cancer,Someone you are fond of needs a shoulder to cry on and you are not the sort to turn them away. You must, however, make it clear to them that only they can get themselves back on their feet. You don’t want to be drying their tears forever. ,cancer,Are you the kind of Cancer who learns from their mistakes, or are you the kind who makes the wrong moves again and again? Either way you must expect a few cuts and bruises over the next 24 hours. How bad they are is up to you.
cancer,You may be intense by nature but you will feel relaxed and good about your life this weekend. Make an effort to meet up with friends and go places that excite you. The same old faces are okay but the same old places will be a bore.
cancer,Before you make your next move ask those you live, work and do business with what they think about your plans and whether they have any suggestions for you. It could be they can see pitfalls that you, in your haste, have managed to miss.
cancer,What occurs today will cheer you up and remind you that life is not so bad, and could be so much better if you made an effort to focus on the good things only. But not too much of an effort – hard work is best avoided this week.
cancer,Family issues will seem less intense as from today. If you have fallen out with a loved one this is the ideal time to kiss and make up. They may have got emotional for no good reason but now both they and you can let it go.
cancer,What you do with your life now is limited only by the boundaries you impose on yourself. Once you understand that you will find it much easier to direct your reality in the direction you want it to go. Imagination plus application equals success. ,cancer,This is a great day to be on the move, so if you find yourself stuck in one place do whatever it takes to break free. Go out of your way to have a good time. Anything that brings a smile to your face has to be good. ,cancer,Even if you are the kind of Cancer who knows how to turn on the charm you may have found it difficult to influence important people in recent weeks. As from today though they will see the sense in what you have to say.
cancer,If you make a serious attempt to change certain aspects of your lifestyle over the next 48 hours you will accomplish far more than you expected. You will be better off without certain beliefs and habits – they are holding you back.
cancer,If you have been holding back from speaking your mind because you did not want to hurt someone’s feelings you will soon realize you have only been delaying the inevitable. Where important matters are concerned honesty is by far the best policy. ,cancer,You may want to help those in need but the simple fact is you cannot assist all of them, so you will have to decide which are the most deserving cases. Focus on those and you will do a lot of good over the next 24 hours.
cancer,The planets are making it easy for you to find the right words to win people round, especially on the work front where you need to stay on good terms with important people. But try to be subtle about it. Don’t make the flattery too blatant. ,cancer,It would be wrong to assume that because a friend has been keeping things from you that they have betrayed your trust. It could just as easily be the case that they were protecting you from negative information you did not need to know.
cancer,It may seem as if someone is being deliberately obstructive, and maybe they are, but it does not mean they don’t have your interests at heart. If they try to guide you in a direction you don’t want to go, go anyway. It may take you somewhere good. ,cancer,You will be even more expressive and emotional than you usually are today. Let those who mean the world to you know how much you care, especially if it has been a long time since you told them. Family matters are under favorable influences. ,cancer,Something will happen this weekend that leaves you in no doubt that a decision you took recently was way off the mark. If there is a price to be paid for your foolishness then pay it and be happy it was not even higher.
cancer,Be careful what you agree to over the next few days because if you offer an inch some people will take a mile. When making deals that could affect you financially make sure everything is written down and witnessed so it cannot be changed later on.
cancer,This may be a carefree time for you but don’t get carried away because you are not invincible. Your mind will come up with some great ideas this week but it is your body that will bear the brunt of the effort. Put your health first.
cancer,Don’t sit back and let things happen, get out into the world and make them happen. Yes, of course, you should listen to what your friends tell you – they will have some sensible suggestions – but ultimately success will depend on you alone.
cancer,This is a great time for networking, for making new contacts, but you must be selective and make sure that you link up with the right people. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it on those who will never be important. ,cancer,The thing you most need to remember today is that not everyone shares your off-the-wall sense of humor. Something that strikes you as funny may be a serious matter to a colleague or friend, so just this once it might be wise not to laugh.
cancer,If you are the kind of Cancer who tends to worry for no good reason then you must promise yourself that no matter what happens over the next 48 hours you won’t let it get to you. Above all, learn to keep things in perspective.
cancer,The message of the stars for you this week is that it’s okay to be imperfect. Too often in the past you have given up on projects because they did not work out as you expected. This time you must see them through to the end. ,cancer,You may feel a bit half-hearted about what is expected of you today but later in the week you will be super enthusiastic about it. You are at a low ebb at the moment but it’s nothing that a bit of rest and relaxation cannot cure.
cancer,You will encounter major opposition to what you intend to do today but that won’t worry you in the slightest. You know what you want and you know where to get it – and anyone who tries to stand in your way won’t be standing for long! ,cancer,You will be a bit impulsive today and that could impact on your home and family life in ways you had not anticipated. However, if you make an effort to explain to loved ones what you need they will do everything they can to get it for you. ,cancer,As Venus, planet of harmony, moves in your favor today it’s unlikely that you will be too serious about life, and that’s good because you do have a tendency to be a bit solemn at times. Life will be fun if you want it to be fun. ,cancer,You must control your reactions this weekend, because if you let your feelings take over you could say or do something you later regret. The Sun in Libra at this time of year can play havoc with your emotions, so don’t go over the top. ,cancer,You seem to have retreated into your shell a bit of late and because of that you have drifted away from people who can be of assistance to you. Make it a priority to let them know you still exist and that you still value their friendship.
cancer,If you want to get on in the world then you will have to be a bit more flexible – make that a lot if you are the kind of Cancer who expects the world to bend to your whims. Remember: the more you give, the more you get.
cancer,Partners and loved ones will be a bit aggressive today and there is a danger that you will react in kind. Don’t. The more you indulge in trading insults now the more making up you will have to do later. There’s no percentage in it.
cancer,Your routine will be disrupted today and all you can do is adapt as best you can. Don’t bother complaining to authority figures because not only do they not care but they might even make things worse for you. Keep a low profile.
cancer,You may not want to let others make decisions for you but you can let them take some of the strain on the work front. You don’t have to do it all yourself Cancer – partners and colleagues will do some heavy lifting if you ask them. ,cancer,You cherish financial security but there is a deeper part of you which knows that money and possessions are in themselves worthless. That part will come to the fore today and you will realize how much of a hindrance material things can be.
cancer,According to the planets you are feeling guilty because things are going so well for you now but so badly for friends and colleagues. It’s good of you to be concerned but it’s your own fate you should be thinking of. Others will come though okay.
cancer,It’s good to let off steam now and again but the planets warn if you make too big a fuss this week others will make life even more difficult for you than it was before. Most of what annoys you is petty in the extreme, so let it pass.
cancer,You will find yourself mixing with some strange people over the next few days. Having said which, in other people’s eyes you often come across as a bit strange yourself! It takes all sorts to make a world – yes, even Cancerians!,cancer,Don’t waste time trying to explain to friends or family members why you had to do a certain thing in a certain way because they won’t understand. Only you know whether it was right or wrong and therefore only you can judge yourself.
cancer,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Capricorn means you would be wise to tread carefully when dealing with people whose emotions are close to the surface. If you do get into an argument today find a way to calm things down again. ,cancer,If someone betrays your trust today you must not let it make you cynical about human nature. There are still plenty of people who are honest and trustworthy and who would not dream of revealing all the secrets they know about you. ,cancer,Because today’s Sun-Pluto link cuts across important angles of your chart you could easily find yourself in a situation where the odds are stacked against you. If so, be smart and back off a bit. Don’t make a war out of a minor skirmish. ,cancer,Don’t be too hard on yourself if something goes wrong this weekend because it won’t be entirely your fault. Besides, the fact that you tried something new is a mark of success, not failure. At least you had the guts to be different.
cancer,Fun times will come naturally to you over the next few days, especially on the home front where disputes will be forgotten and loved ones will go out of their way to make you feel good. Make the most of it – you know it won’t last. ,cancer,An offer of some kind may be tempting but can you be sure it is right for you? Take care when dealing with people who promise you the world. You should know by now that the only real way to make a fortune is to work for it.
cancer,You are attaching too much importance to something that just a few days ago would have meant nothing to you at all. Why you should have gone from one extreme to the other is anyone’s guess but you need to back off a bit. ,cancer,It may be true that certain people are talking about you behind your back but why should that concern you? There is nothing they can say that will divert you from the path you have chosen, so long as you continue to believe in yourself. ,cancer,Relationships seem to be taking on a more aggressive edge. You need to remind yourself every now and again that life is not a battle, that more can be achieved in the long-term by compromise and cooperation. Strive to make friends, not enemies. ,cancer,You have so much to look forward to but, as Cancer tends to do, you are looking back and lamenting what might have been. You have to educate yourself and train yourself to care more about what is coming than what has already gone. ,cancer,Your emotions will get the better of you over the next 48 hours and you could say or do something you later regret. Don’t condemn yourself for it though. Even a down-to-earth Cancer cannot control their feelings every minute of every day.
cancer,You may be tempted to tell someone in a position of authority why you no longer respect them but the full moon warns the consequences could be dire. You know the old saying: if you can’t say something nice then don’t say anything at all.
cancer,Someone you can usually trust is being obstructive and, of course, you are far from happy about it. But before you hit back try to work out why they are being so bloody-minded. Maybe it’s because they think it’s for your own good.
cancer,Not everyone is as honest as you and if you keep that thought in mind today you are less likely to be cheated by someone who thinks it’s okay to steal. It’s sad that people like that exist but they do and you must be aware of it.
cancer,You will find it easier to make an important decision when the Sun moves into your fellow Water sign of Scorpio on Saturday. Partners and loved ones will respect your decision and get behind you with their full support – which makes a nice change!,cancer,The worse things have been for you in recent weeks the better they will be when the Sun moves in your favor tomorrow. That may sound too good to be true but the cosmic powers that be are about to smile on you again.
cancer,All the worries of the past few weeks will be swept away this weekend. No matter how difficult things have been for you the tide has now well and truly turned. Indulge your whims and fancies. Life is for living and loving and laughing. ,cancer,Just a few days ago you would have laughed if someone had said the good times are coming back. Now you know that it’s true. The Sun in Scorpio will open your eyes to the world as it truly is: an inspirational and astonishing place.
cancer,Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into the most dynamic area of your chart as the new week begins, so any doubts you have about what you are doing will soon be swept away. All things are possible for you now, so be brilliant.
cancer,Honesty may be the best policy but just this once it may be better to avoid the truth, if only to spare a friend or family member the embarrassment of realizing they got something completely and utterly wrong. Not all lies are bad.
cancer,You could gain a lot or you could lose a lot today. If you are in any way ambitious someone in a position of power will make you the proverbial offer you find hard to refuse. Yes, it’s an amazing proposal, but is there a downside too? ,cancer,You have so much to be thankful for and so much to look forward to, so why do you look so glum? Okay, so Cancerians tends to look sad even when they are happy but you really must brighten up a bit. Smiles will take you miles. ,cancer,Cosmic activity in the work and wellbeing area of your chart urges you to take life at an easy pace and let things happen rather than try to make them happen. If you try to force the pace you will tire yourself out for no good reason. ,cancer,You will have to fight for your rights this weekend, both at home and at work. It may not be pleasant but Cancer is a cardinal sign, meaning you are not the sort to duck out of a challenge. Give as good as you get, then give some more.
cancer,You will start a lot of new things over the next seven days but how many of them will you actually finish? Maybe you should lower your sights a bit and focus on just one or two tasks at a time. It’s about quality, not quantity.
cancer,Try not to get too caught up in your own problems because you can learn a lot from other people and how they handle themselves. If you listen to what they say you could stumble across the answer you have been looking for.
cancer,Sometimes it is nice to just go with the flow and let others call the tune and such a time is now. Today’s Sun-Neptune link encourages you to take it easy for a day or two, or longer. The important thing is that you are free from stress.
cancer,The message of the stars today is that success will come quicker, and last longer, if you stop thinking in terms of winning and losing. Life is not a zero sum game: what you get you do not have to take from somebody else. Everyone can win.
cancer,You may find it hard to put your feelings into words today but your body language will speak volumes. If you have fallen out with a friend or relative over something petty now is the time to put it behind you. Love cures everything. ,cancer,If you take the opposite viewpoint to everyone else you are asking for trouble. Be careful you don’t stir things up so much that you lose control of the situation and turn people against you. A pretend argument could easily turn into a real one. ,cancer,If you want to make an impression on employers and other important people now is the time to get serious about it. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart urges you to do something drastic, something that makes the world take notice.
cancer,It’s time to face up to an issue that you have been trying so hard to avoid. Common sense should tell you that sooner or later you will have to deal with it, so it might as well be now while your confidence is still high.
cancer,The Sun in your fellow Water sign of Scorpio means that happy days are here again. No, really. Over the coming week make it a priority to kiss and make up with anyone you have fallen out with. Don’t let bad feelings hold you back.
cancer,Something you thought was going so well will suffer an unexpected setback over the next 24 hours. Whatever the cause may be it is not the end of the world, so don’t overreact. Your big brain will come up with a solution – it always does.
cancer,It is beginning to dawn on you that you may have been a bit too free and easy with your money and other resources in recent months. You now need to balance the books and make sure your financial situation does not spiral out of control. ,cancer,If others try to rush you today you must make a special effort to slow things down and think things through. No, you won’t miss out on a golden opportunity if you don’t act fast. Whoever is telling you that is not to be trusted.
cancer,You are determined to do something amazing, something the world will remember you for, years into the future. Just make sure you don’t do anything that might be seen by others as self-indulgent or even illegal. Keep your moral compass switched on. ,cancer,Venus, planet of love and harmony, moves into the partnership area of your chart this weekend and almost immediately a relationship problem of some kind won’t seem so serious. You will find it easy to forgive and forget and move on.
cancer,You could find yourself caught in the middle of some kind of feud this week and you must make it a point of policy not to favor either one side or the other. It’s not a case of right or wrong, it’s a case of self-preservation. ,cancer,Make allowances for those who are unable to think or act as quickly as you. You may be able to see the wider picture and understand how things fit together but to others it might as well be written in a language they don’t understand. Be patient.
cancer,Whatever you are working on today make sure you give it 100 percent. While those around you are slacking off and winding down you should be pushing yourself that little bit harder to accomplish that little bit extra. Winners never take it easy.
cancer,If certain people have been less than helpful of late don’t make a big deal of it. Life moves in cycles and their attitude will most likely swing from one extreme to the other over the next few days. They will want to do everything for you. ,cancer,With the Sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you don’t find it difficult to get your own way but this phase is coming to an end, so make the most of your chances while you can. That goes for romantic chances too!,cancer,Both at home and at work you must seize the initiative and make your own decisions. If you allow others too much of a say you may find they end up running the show and that won’t be good for your ego. Don’t be afraid to be more assertive. ,cancer,After the fun and games of recent weeks you now have to get serious about your work and your health. Because everything has been going so well for you of late you may have let that side of your life slide. It’s time to take care of details again.
cancer,If there is something you wanted to do but never quite got around to you might as well give up on it completely. There will be so many new experiences over the next few days that you won’t have time for yesterday’s projects. Move on.
cancer,If you need to ask a favor of someone now is the time to speak up. There is a every chance that they will do what you ask of them but be smart and don’t make your request sound like an order or a threat – they won’t like that.
cancer,You may find it hard to say sorry, especially if you believe that you are not the one to blame for what went wrong, but if you are smart you will put your ego aside and make peace with a co-worker. Go on, kiss and make up. ,cancer,It may look as if your big chance has come and gone but that simply is not true and what happens over the next few days will open a door you thought had been closed for good. For now though conserve your energy – you are going to need it!,cancer,If you have promised to do something for a loved one then you have no option but to see it through to completion. Today’s Venus-Pluto union in your opposite sign will give you the energy you need to get it done. In future, don’t promise so much. ,cancer,There is a time and a place for work and a time and a place for play and the two should be kept as far apart as possible this weekend. Give yourself permission to go out and have fun and don’t think about work again until Monday. ,cancer,Don’t get bogged down by details and trivia over the next few days. Promise yourself now that you will focus only on essentials, such as getting ahead in your career and making a fortune from your wonderful ideas – and yes, they really are quite brilliant.
cancer,What happens over the next 24 hours will force you to rethink both your working routine and the way you look at your health. You have been pushing yourself too hard for too long and the cracks are beginning to show – so slow down.
cancer,You don’t have time for fun and games. There are so many serious matters that need to be dealt with, so don’t get sidetracked by non-essentials. A new moon makes this the perfect time for a new start, especially in your working routine. ,cancer,Although you may be eager to get moving you should take it easy for the sake of your health. The first thing you must do today is to ask yourself, honestly, if there is anything that has to be done immediately. Chances are most things can wait. ,cancer,It’s not unusual for you to get emotional about certain issues but with the Sun at odds with Neptune today there is a danger you will go WAY over the top. Stop and think before each and every act you take. Ask yourself: is it really necessary? ,cancer,You need to get things done and because you cannot do it all on your own you have no option but to trust other people. What others tell you today could lead to success beyond your wildest dreams – if you believe them and if you act quickly. ,cancer,Pace yourself sensibly over the next 48 hours because the planets warn if you don’t slow down you might hurt yourself. There comes a time when what you put into a task is more than what you get out of it – and that’s the time to stop. ,cancer,Money may be tight at the moment but that is no reason to deny yourself the good things in life. On the contrary, you will feel a lot happier over the next few days if you splash out a bit. But only a bit – you haven’t won the lottery! ,cancer,If someone asks you to take on new responsibilities over the next 24 hours you must say ‘No’. Let others know right from the start that you are simply too busy to help them out at the moment. Tell them you might be free some time next year!,cancer,You may not be able to explain why you distrust a certain person but you know deep down that you must not take anything they tell you at face value. Always trust what your inner voice tells you, even if it means you risk losing a friend.
cancer,You will make up your mind about things very quickly today and once you have made a decision you won’t go back on it. Which could be costly if your decisions about money matters and business issues turn out to be wrong. Get a second opinion.
cancer,You need to make important decisions for people who rely on you, the kind of decisions that will shape their lives for years to come. Don’t worry that the welfare of loved ones is in your hands – fate has put you in this position for a reason.
cancer,Suddenly you feel optimistic again but a degree of caution is needed – don’t go over the top and do something you might later regret. Also, don’t use your privileged position to avoid tasks and duties that are boring – because they are necessary too.
cancer,You will be in a serious frame of mind over the next few days, especially on the work front where you are determined to show what you can do. Anyone who tries to distract you in any way must be left in no doubt that you are not amused.
cancer,Listen to advice by all means but check facts and figures for yourself before acting on what you are told. No matter how reliable you believe your sources to be make sure they have got it right – or it is you who will suffer most.
cancer,You need to find ways to make your everyday routine less taxing. To start with you must make sure that colleagues are doing their fair share of the work. Just because you can do a task better than everyone else does not mean you have to do it.
leo,Because Tuesday’s new moon falls in the most creative and dynamic sector of your chart you will be full of yourself over the next few days. You will also attract the kind of people who make fun things happen. Together you’ll have a blast!,leo,What others expect of you is not important – what matters is what you expect of yourself. Others may say you should be doing this or doing that today but you must reject it all and do only what makes you happy.
leo,Yours is one of the most favored signs at the moment and today’s new moon in your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius urges you to cash in on your creative ideas. Do what feels right to you, not what others say can or should be done.
leo,You may have no particular interest in the chores you are expected to do today, but do them anyway and make sure you do a good job. Come the weekend you will be free again to pursue your own interests with a clear conscience.
leo,Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, joins the Sun in the most creative area of your chart today. What does that mean in plain English? It means you must let the world know of your achievements – of which there are plenty. ,leo,There are only so many hours in a day, even for a Leo, so identify your priorities and don’t try to do everything at once. Aim for quality rather than quantity in all things at all times – one way or another it will be enough.
leo,You need to have a definite objective in mind and a clear-cut plan to help you to reach it. If so, there is nothing you cannot do over the next few days. A little bit of forethought will bring rewards beyond your wildest dreams.
leo,Others may try to disrupt your plans over the next few days but they will only succeed if they are so inflexible that minor setbacks cause major problems. Be ready and willing to adapt – it’s what separates the winners from the losers. ,leo,Make sure you focus on positive things as the new week begins because if you allow negative thoughts to get a hold you will find it hard to shake them off again. Whatever your current problems may be they’re not as bad as they seem.
leo,You need to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk with someone you care for. A lot of things have been said and done in recent days and the time has come to clear the air. Be honest about your feelings and let them be honest too.
leo,You need to get your financial house in order and you need to do so quickly. Be ruthless with yourself and make sure you know the difference between your needs and your desires. If something is not an absolute necessity then live without it.
leo,It may be hard for you to understand why certain people act in certain ways but there is no point getting worked up about it because you won’t change the way they are. Try acting as if you don’t care in the slightest what they do.
leo,You may have to do something that makes you unpopular today but that won’t worry you one bit. You know there are times when you have to put duty before pleasure and this is clearly one of them. Do it and do it well.
leo,You don’t seem quite so concerned now about what you earn and how much you spend and that’s good. Leos do best when they focus on the bigger picture and money is such a little thing. Make having fun your priority this weekend.
leo,You tend to stick with what you know and trust and most of the time it works but over the next few days you may have to update your ideas a bit. Ultimately, everyone has to move with the times – yes, even a Leo!,leo,Others may be having second thoughts about what you are doing but you have no such doubts. Even if you do make a mistake or two along the way your momentum and sense of purpose will keep you moving towards your goal.
leo,You may be brave by nature but taking risks is best avoided today, especially on the home front where loved ones are unlikely to see the funny side of your pranks – and even less if they have to come and rescue you.
leo,You have been in impressive form of late but all good things must come to an end and life may not be quite so easy when the Sun changes signs on the 21st. If there is anything of a creative nature that needs doing then do it now. ,leo,A moment’s hesitation could cause you grief – at the very least you will kick yourself for not trusting your instincts. Don’t listen to those who say you should be cautious. It may be good advice for them but it’s not right for you.
leo,The past few weeks have seen you at your most confident and dynamic but now you need to pay a bit more attention to the little things – but only a bit. Don’t lose sight of the big picture but find ways to paint it on an everyday canvas.
leo,Life is supposed to be fun and will continue to be fun if you don’t let minor issues get to you. Also, don’t waste time worrying that others are not so fortunate. Be happy and successful yourself and be the example they want to follow.
leo,Sit down, put your feet up and let others do all the running around. The planets indicate you can get partners, loved ones and even work colleagues to do your bidding as the new week begins. It is, after all, the natural order of things.
leo,Matters of a routine nature will take up a lot of time but once you have completed your tasks you can move on to something more interesting. Whatever else you do today, don’t cut corners as it could cost you a lot more than you can afford.
leo,The more you try to focus on a particular task the more your mind seems to wander and the more frustrated you get. Take the hint and stop trying so hard. Go easy on yourself today and let life come to you for a change.
leo,You may be tempted to change something that has worked for years, but is that such a good idea? In your present mood there is every possibility that you will go too far and change things in a revolutionary rather than an evolutionary way.
leo,Take nothing for granted over the next 24 hours, not even things you have done a thousand times before. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your work and your daily routine. Make sure what you are doing is done right.
leo,Stop wasting time and energy trying to make sense of things that to your way of thinking make no sense at all. You don’t have to fit everything in your life into a neat and tidy box. Some things are destined to remain a mystery.
leo,It may be the party season but you still have work to do and because of that you may have to cut back a bit on the fun and games this week. Of course, you’ll have more time for work and play if you organize your time more efficiently.
leo,The approaching new moon will make it abundantly clear what needs to be done to sort out a work or health problem of some kind. Actually you’ve known for a while but you keep putting it off. This time you must act quickly and decisively.
leo,Try not to get upset about anything today, especially issues that are trivial in the extreme. The planets warn that your health could suffer if you get too emotional, so be positive and avoid negative thinking — and negative people. ,leo,You may feel so good about yourself now that you believe you can push yourself harder than ever before and not worry about the consequences. Push yourself hard if you must but give yourself plenty of rest as well. Balance is essential.
leo,Your confidence may sink a bit today but it’s only a passing phase so don’t worry about it. Most likely you are the only one whowill notice anyway. A Leo who lacks confidence still looks and sounds like a winner to everyone else.
leo,Your mind is extraordinarily active at the moment and that’s good, but make sure you write down any insights you have otherwise you may forget them by the end of the day. Carry a pen and notebook with you at all times.
leo,You may not see the point in what you are being asked to do, but as it is for someone you respect and look up to, you will do it anyway. Don’t worry, everything will fall into place and make sense come Monday morning.
leo,Be careful you don’t miss something that is small but important over the next few days. Set aside some time in your busy schedule for looking at the bigger picture – once you “get it” the details will start to make more sense too.
leo,There may be a certain amount of tension in the air over the next few days and it may even linger until Mercury changes signs next weekend. It won’t cause you any major problems but try not to snap at people for no good reason.
leo,Everything must be in its proper place, and if it isn’t then someone is going to get the blame — and it won’t be you. You may be easy-going most of the time, but sometimes you are like your next-door-neighbor sign Virgo — obsessed by details. ,leo,No matter how unsettling the changes that are now taking place may be keep telling yourself that in the long-term they will work in your favor. Your life story is unfolding and evolving exactly as it should. You don’t have to change a thing.
leo,This is a good day for friendship and even more so for romance and if anyone is of the opinion that you lack passion they will soon see the error of their ways. When a Leo gets fired up the heat is enough to melt the coldest of hearts.
leo,If you have done something you are proud of then shout about it and let everyone know. You are no stranger to drawing attention to yourself but this is one of those occasions when you have every right to go on a lap of honor.
leo,Flattery will get you almost everywhere this week but it won’t get you the one place you really want to go. As a Leo you demand honesty of other people, so why should they not demand honesty of you? Just tell the truth.
leo,You may know what you are after but you still need help in getting it. If you don’t ask for assistance today you may find yourself being left behind on the work front. Next time, try not to take on so many tasks all at once.
leo,It might be a smart idea to take a closer look at howyou organize your everyday affairs. Start thinking of ways you can make your routines simpler and your chores less of a burden. One way, of course, is to get others to do them for you.
leo,You will fall out with someone you usually get along with today, most likely because you cannot agree on issues of a philosophical nature. Fortunately, you will also find it easy to make up and be friends again, so it’s no big deal.
leo,Don’t take it personally if family and friends are hard to get through to today: it seems they have a lot on their minds at the moment. If there are issues you need to discuss, wait until tomorrow when they won’t be quite so worried by life.
leo,Today’s Mercury-Uranus link will give you an advantage in that it helps you see things way ahead of everyone else. However, other aspects warn that what you see over the weekend may be misleading, so don’t get carried away.
leo,Relationships of one sort or another will be much on your mind this weekend but don’t make any major decisions until the Sun changes signs on Monday. Only then will you begin to see what certain people really mean to you.
leo,The Sun moves into the partnership area of your chart on Monday, making it easy to persuade those you live and work with to see things your way. Even if it turns out later that your way is the wrong way they will happily forgive you.
leo,For the next few weeks the Sun will be moving through your opposite sign of Aquarius, so opposition of one kind or another is to be expected. Make things easy for yourself: take others’ needs and wishes into consideration more often.
leo,Now that the Sun is transiting your opposite sign of Aquarius you must make an effort to see things from alternative points of view. Also, don’t criticize people you care for just because they fail to live up to your high standards. Nobody ever does.
leo,Someone’s negative attitudes are getting you down more than you care to admit, so if you have been thinking of bringing a partnership to an end now is the time to be decisive. Don’t feel sorry for them – it’s your peace of mind that matters.
leo,Someone you live or work with is harboring a secret grudge and if you say the wrong thing they will find a way to use it against you. Think before you speak and make sure you know what you are talking about. Is that so hard?,leo,Honesty is essential if you are to resolve an issue that has been dragging on forever. But that does not only mean you being honest with others, it also means others being honest with you. Encourage them to speak up. Find out what they think.
leo,You must be under no illusions as to what is important and what is not – and what you stand to lose if you get them mixed up. Be on your guard when making deals with people whose motives are vague. They could be up to no good.
leo,No matter how bad your own situation may be you must make time to help partners and loved ones solve their problems. They need someone with your no-nonsense nature to give them the kick start they need. You can do that.
leo,If you work with the planets this week you will find ways to shape your destiny. If you work against them your destiny will still change but maybe not in ways you feel comfortable with. Find which way the wind is blowing and blow with it.
leo,Although you think you know what is going on you would still be wise to wait a day or two before making any major decisions. In fact, for best results bide your time until Thursday when the moon is new in your opposite sign. What’s the rush?,leo,Your aims and ambitions may seem impractical to some, but so what? The approaching new moon will give you a head start on your rivals, and no matter how far behind you may be at this moment, you will soon be ahead of the pack.
leo,Whatever goals you set your sights on over the next few days you will reach them with ease. But don’t spend all your time and energy on work: this is potentially one of the best days of the year for affairs of the heart.
leo,There may be a thousand and one chores you would like to avoid but you can’t, so don’t waste time on wishful thinking. Positive thinking, however, is to be encouraged, so imagine you are having the time of your life. Your thoughts will make it happen.
leo,A project will have to be postponed for a while, which won’t please you, but in the long-term it will work out fine. In fact a delay is just what you need as it will help you get your ideas together. You must be clear about your aims.
leo,You won’t have to make much effort or spend much money to get what you desire over the next few days. Your powers of persuasion have rarely been higher and if you ask for something you will get it with no questions asked.
leo,It might be tempting to work even harder and faster but you will accomplish more in the long-term if you start slowly and think about what you are doing. And don’t let colleagues and employers pressure you into doing too much.
leo,Anyone who thinks they can trick you into doing something that is not in your interests is in for a rude awakening. One such individual will try to put one over on you today, but they will end up looking extremely foolish. ,leo,Unexpected events will disrupt your routine today and, to say the least, you won’t be happy about it. But as there is nothing you can do to change things there’s really not much point getting uptight about it, is there? Stay calm and carry on.
leo,You need to make a decision about a partnership or relationship matter. If you don’t the issue will be taken out of your hands and other people will make the decision for you – and almost certainly they won’t do what pleases you.
leo,It’s time for a clear-out. There are a number of things in your life that you no longer need, so make a list of what they are then get rid of them all in one go. You can be surprisingly ruthless when you put your mind to it!,leo,Steer clear of other people’s disputes today. No matter how well-intentioned you may be you are likely to end up supporting the wrong side, which won’t do your reputation for picking winners much good. The only side you need to be on is your own.
leo,The planets are encouraging you to go with the flow and let others call the shots for a while. Being a Leo and a natural born leader that may not be easy but every now and again it’s good to take a back seat for a change. ,leo,You must deal with a money worry you have been doing your best to ignore. Now that Mercury is about to begin one of its retrograde phases you will have to be totally honest with yourself, because no one else will be.
leo,Like everyone you have secrets and one particular secret could be dangerous if other people get to know about it. Make sure you don’t say or do anything today that might give your opponents a clue as to what you’ve been up to.
leo,Not everyone will agree with what you intend to do this weekend but that won’t worry you in the slightest – in fact you rather enjoy going against what the so-called experts say is the right way of doing things. You know better.
leo,If you need to make changes to a partnership of some kind then do so today because once the Sun begins a new cycle tomorrow it won’t be so easy. Also, if you negotiate changes now you won’t have to pay too much for them.
leo,You cannot afford to back down today. The planets warn if you give ground once you will be expected to give ground again and again and soon you will be in full retreat. Leos are supposed to be stubborn, so dig in your heels (and claws).
leo,Steer clear of people who seem to enjoy talking about their worries and woes. It may make them feel good to feel bad, but it will bring you down from your high and spoil what might otherwise be a marvelous day. Be upbeat at all times. ,leo,It will pay you to be a bit more ruthless today, especially when dealing with people who always seem to get more out of your relationship than you do. Look tough, talk tough and, when the time comes, act tough too. Earn their respect.
leo,You will discover something new about a friend or colleague today and although it may shock you a bit you will also be impressed, not least because they managed to keep it a secret so long. But don’t go telling everyone. It can still be private.
leo,With the Sun linked to Neptune, planet of generosity, the only real danger this weekend is that you might be too giving and forgiving for your own good. Be warned that some people will take advantage of you if they get the chance.
leo,You need to be careful where business issues are concerned this week, and if you are offered some kind of deal you must investigate it thoroughly. The devil is in the details and if you miss the small print you may have to pay.
leo,Focus on what you own and earn and make sure you are getting paid the right amount for your considerable talents. If you allow yourself to be cheated out of small amounts now you will be cheated out of larger amounts later on.
leo,You seem to be in one of your more impulsive moods and that could lead to something good . . . or something bad. You will get yourself into some risky situations – the sort you like best – but you know how to get out of them too.
leo,Be careful you don’t get swept along by events and end up doing things you might later regret. It’s rarely a good idea to follow the herd and someone with your switched on and enquiring mind has no need to let others think for them.
leo,Be careful what you ask for over the next two or three days because you are likely to get it. Why could that be a problem? Because the responsibilities that go with it could take away a lot of the fun. Only say it if you mean it.
leo,A friend or loved one will speak their mind today and what they have to say will undoubtedly shock you. You never realized they could be so passionate, or so angry. Well, now you know, so what are you going to do about it?,leo,Something that has been worrying you for ages will no longer be a problem after today. Money matters, especially, will look much more positive than they have done for a very long time. One way or another you will get what you need.
leo,You will be under a lot of pressure this week, but nothing will happen that you cannot handle, so keep your wits about you and don’t give in to panic. You have what it takes to win in all kinds of situations, so believe in yourself.
leo,The week ahead will be busy in the extreme but you’re ready for the challenges that will come your way – in fact you’re eager for them. Don’t wait for others to take the lead, take it yourself and inspire others to follow you.
leo,Someone whose personality is as strong as your own will refuse to follow your lead today and, to say the least, you won’t be too happy about it. But what can you do? Let them do their own thing. You don’t need them anyway.
leo,Venus, planet of love, moves into the relationship area of your chart today, so anything of a partnership nature will go well. No matter how busy you may be at work take time to remind that one special person how much they mean to you.
leo,You will no doubt wonder what the catch is when someone in a position of authority offers you something you have long desired, but there is no need to be suspicious. They are not setting you up to knock you down. Not this time anyway!,leo,The planets urge you not to plan too far ahead because even routine matters are likely to change over the days, weeks and months to come. You also need to be a bit more flexible. Know when it is in your interests to change course.
leo,Anything you do on impulse today and tomorrow will most likely work out well. Your impatience with restrictions, especially in your career, may cause some friction but it will also impress those above you in the workplace hierarchy.
leo,It’s okay to put off a task that not only does not have to be done right away but which you can easily get others to do for you. What happens over the next seven days is likely to make it irrelevant anyway, so why worry?,leo,Try not to commit yourself to anything that cannot be changed at a moment’s notice. The planets are unsettled to say the least, so keep things fluid and be prepared to drop what you are working on and start something new and exciting.
leo,Try not to worry about personal or money problems. The cosmic picture suggests that your state of mind will be much more positive once next weekend’s full moon has swept away certain doubts and obstructions. No, the sky is not about to fall!,leo,You know just what to say and do to win friends and relatives round to your way of thinking. Whether your way of thinking is correct is, of course, another matter entirely – but since when do Leos worry about little things like that?,leo,If you don’t want to do something then leave it. Others may moan that you should be making more of an effort but they’re wrong. You should work only on things that interest you. Anything else can safely be left to another day, or year.
leo,Are you promising more than you can deliver? Maybe, but your confidence is so high at the moment that the thought of failure does not cross your mind, which in turn makes success more likely. Will you be able to deliver the goods? We’ll see!,leo,You may be a bit short of cash this weekend but you have only yourself to blame. If you are honest you will admit you have been rather extravagant of late. Take it as a gentle reminder that you need to get your financial house in order.
leo,The Sun crosses one of the more dynamic angles of your chart in midweek and inevitably the pace of life will pick up – and about time. The past few weeks have been a bit of a slog. Now, at last, you can have some fun.
leo,Everyone makes mistakes, so don’t beat yourself up just because you got something wrong. The important thing is that you recognize where you made an error and resolve not to make it again. Failure can often be a stepping stone to success.
leo,Give partners and loved ones room to be themselves. Allow them to go off and do their own thing at their own speed in their own way. If you try to restrict their movements you will succeed only in making them more rebellious.
leo,You may want to make an issue of something but before you do make sure the facts are on your side. Remember, too, that it’s not enough to tell others that they are doing it wrong – they also need to be shown how to do it right.
leo,Nothing matters more than the truth and if you keep that thought in mind over the next few days you won’t go far wrong. The truth may at times be uncomfortable but that is not an excuse to ignore it or to follow illusions rather than facts.
leo,The planets warn that anything you do in haste over the next 24 hours will be repented for days if not weeks to come. Slow down, take your time and make sure you have made the correct decisions before you take any action.
leo,This is one of the best times of the year for you but the current cosmic climate warns you should hold off starting anything new until Monday at the earliest. Only then will you have a clear idea of the road you are destined to take.
leo,You may not agree that someone deserves all the attention they are getting but that’s how it is. Instead of getting angry about it why don’t you do something that pulls the spotlight away from them? You’ve got ten times their star quality.
leo,Don’t let anyone restrict your freedoms. You need to let those who would like to take away your right to think and speak for yourself that you are not having it, that you will fight them all the way. And you must mean it.
leo,You’re not the sort to stick with what you know and trust and that’s good. The more you are on the move today, the more you are meeting new people and trying new things, the more likely it is you will find happiness and success.
leo,Either you will come into money today or you will come up with a plan that makes you money at some stage in the future. If it’s the latter, be patient. Some things are worth waiting for and true wealth is one of them.
leo,If you need help over the next 24 hours then come right out and ask for it. If you wait for others to realize that you require assistance chances are you will never get it – not because they don’t care but because they can’t read your mind.
leo,If someone suggests that you need to prove your commitment to them then maybe you should reconsider the status of your relationship. As far as you are concerned it is a partnership of equals. If they can’t agree with that then say goodbye.
leo,Try not to take life so seriously this weekend. Yes, of course, you have ambitions and responsibilities like everyone else but if you treat life as a gift to be enjoyed rather than a trial to be endured you’ll find things go a lot better for you.
leo,Do something out of the ordinary this week. Do something that not even your best friends would expect of you. Wednesday’s Sun-Uranus link will inspire you to misbehave, to shock, to flout authority. Just be careful you don’t get arrested. ,leo,Your dominant position will be challenged over the next few days and you will have to fight hard to retain your status. Anyone who thinks you will roll over and give up obviously does not know you too well, which is a point in your favor.
leo,You may want to be friends with everyone but today’s Sun-Jupiter link warns you need to be discerning. The fact is there are some people who you will never get along with because you are on different emotional and intellectual levels.
leo,Someone will make a big deal of something that to you is of no real significance. There is no point trying to reason it through because reason is an alien concept to them at the moment. Stay out of their way until they come to their senses.
leo,You seem to be working harder than ever of late but are you working for yourself or are you working for other people? That’s the question you most need to ask today and if the answer is the latter you will need to make changes.
leo,If there is something important that needs to be done over the next two or three days then get on with it and ignore those who say you’re not up to the task. They have no idea what you are capable of – though they will soon find out!,leo,Money matters and business issues seem to be worrying you quite a bit of late but you can make things easier for yourself this weekend by letting partners and loved ones take decisions for you. Can you trust them? Yes you can.
leo,You can expect some kind of good fortune over the next few days, although it may not be of a material or financial nature. Most likely your mind will be opened to new and uplifting ideas – and that’s worth much more than money.
leo,Get out and about. Do something different and exciting. This is a great time to take the kind of break where you get away from routine matters and challenge yourself to have as much fun as is humanly possible – and that’s a lot!,leo,Do you like a challenge? Of course you do and that’s just as well because if you want to remain a contender, especially on the work front, you will need to up your game over the next two or three days. Winning is everything.
leo,Others may have doubts about what you are doing but you have no doubts at all and will push ahead regardless. The Sun in Aries endows you with loads of energy and almost limitless self-belief and that’s a combination that can’t be beaten.
leo,Try not to expose yourself to any kind of situation where you do not have full control over what happens. Your confidence may be high at the moment but that will not protect you from people who do not share your sense of fair play.
leo,Over the next week or so you will find yourself thinking more and more about your career and your long-term ambitions. The need to make money may be a motivating factor but the most important thing is that you work at something you love.
leo,Today’s Sun-Saturn link urges you to be cautious but not so cautious that you fail to do anything at all. If you get the urge to travel that’s fine but make sure loved ones know where you are going and when you’ll be back.
leo,The planets warn you need to make up your mind soon about where you intend to be six months from now. Within a matter of days a new opportunity will knock at your door but you need to be ready to make a long-term commitment.
leo,Don’t try too hard to stay on top of your workload today. The deadlines you have set yourself are unnecessary – no one will think less of you if you fail to meet them. Why make such a big effort when you really don’t have to?,leo,By all means listen to what friends and family members have to tell you but don’t think for a moment it’s all true. Act on the assumption that you have not yet heard the whole story. Use your intelligence to fill in the gaps.
leo,You may have to defend what you believe in today, and you should do so with every weapon at your disposal. Don’t ever forget that you are as entitled to your viewpoints and opinions as other people are to their own. And yours are better!,leo,Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely and if they like what they see you could be in for a promotion or a pay rise – or both – when the Sun moves into the career area of your chart at the weekend. Look and act sharp!,leo,You will accomplish more over the next two or three days if you can get yourself out of the habit of trying to do everything on your own. Working with others may not always be fun but you don’t have to like people to get things done.
leo,You must be clear in your mind what it is you are aiming for, especially in your career, because if you have doubts you may waste a golden opportunity to get ahead in the world. Whatever you do, make sure you’re the best.
leo,There is no doubt you have big ambitions and there is no doubt you will go far but you don’t have to act in haste. The Sun remains in the career area of your chart for the next four weeks, so take your time and make the right decisions.
leo,As Uranus, planet of changes, squares up to Pluto, planet of power, over the next 24 hours you will understand why it is wrong to try to force people to do things against their will, even in a good cause. Put simply: it doesn’t work.
leo,You can be a bit impetuous at times and the planets warn you must make sure you know what is going on before jumping head first into situation you know little about. Let others make the first moves – and give them a push if needs be.
leo,Mercury, planet of the mind, crosses the career angle of your chart today, which means you will no longer be able to kid yourself about what is and is not possible, especially on the career front. It’s time to get serious about your ambitions.
leo,With both the Sun and Mercury moving through the status area of your chart you will make friends with the right sort of people and there is no telling where that might lead. Get to know some VIPs – and very soon you’ll be one yourself.
leo,Make sure you get value for money today because if you don’t take care of your cash others will get rich at your expense. You may not care now how much things are costing you but you will care later when you can no longer afford them.
leo,This weekend’s cosmic influences will help you break free of situations that are holding you back from fulfilling your true potential. But it won’t just happen as if by magic – the desire and the effort, as always, must come from you.
leo,A solar eclipse in the career area of your chart this week will inspire you to accomplish remarkable things. Set your sights high, believe in yourself, then act on that belief. Almost immediately your dreams will start to come true.
leo,Put yourself forward and show what you can do. Employers and others in positions of power are looking for people who are decisive, for people who have no doubts, for people who are prepared to risk all to gain all. And that’s you.
leo,Today’s solar eclipse in the career area of your chart will give you the energy and the confidence to put yourself forward and let people in positions of power and authority know you are special. This is no time for false modesty Leo!,leo,You will come in for criticism of some kind today but if you are smart you will ignore it completely. At best it is misguided, at worst it is sour grapes. The simple fact is some people envy you for being such a larger-than-life character.
leo,If a project does not seem to be working out or if your ultimate goal is as far away as ever, perhaps you should take it as a sign that something is wrong. It’s not too late to change course – only your ego is holding you back.
leo,Slow down and give your physical, mental and emotional batteries a chance to recharge. The good news is you have already made a big impression on someone in a position of power – you really don’t have to keep proving yourself.
leo,Don’t push too hard to change things this weekend, either in your personal life or at work. The planets indicate you will achieve more in the long-term if you react to how things happen rather than try to make them happen for yourself.
leo,Make sure your voice is heard this week. And remember it’s not about how loud you shout but how well your know your facts and how confidently you express them. You’re a leader by nature and others will want to follow you.
leo,You will be much in demand socially today but you must choose carefully among the many invitations you receive because you won’t have the time or the energy to say yes to them all. Which of them will further your status the most?,leo,The planets warn that you may have deviated from your blueprint by a small amount, so maybe you should stand back from what you are working on and make sure it is still going according to plan. If not, make whatever changes are necessary.
leo,The message of the stars for you today is that you must allow friends and family members to make more decisions for themselves. Over the past few weeks you have insisted on taking the lead but now it’s time to give others a chance.
leo,It’s good that you know how to be assertive when dealing with important people but the planets warn you must not go too far. If you break the rules over the next 24 hours someone higher up the ladder than you will make you pay for it.
leo,Make sure you do not commit yourself to anything you cannot back out of later, especially if there is money at stake. Most of the time your instincts can be trusted but this may be the one time in a thousand when they let you down.
leo,The Sun in the career area of your chart makes you ultra ambitious but as Saturn, planet of limitation, is also strong this weekend you may have to rein in your aspirations, at least for a while. That’s okay – you don’t have to do it all at once.
leo,Don’t be too hard on yourself this week. Not even a Leo can get it right every time and if something goes badly wrong you should put it down to experience and move on quickly. There are still plenty of successes coming your way.
leo,Something you have kept secret for a long time will come to the surface over the next few days. In a way it will be a relief as you will no longer have to play silly games and pretend to be who and what you know you are not.
leo,You will be extraordinarily assertive on the work front over the next few days, which is good, but you could also annoy people who think you are trying to usurp their position. You must stay on good terms with those in positions of power.
leo,The Sun in the career area of your chart is on your side but other forces are at work that are trying to deny you the chance to move up in the world. Don’t give in to negative people or the negative thoughts they try to sow in your mind.
leo,No matter how many things may have gone wrong in your life in recent weeks your luck will change for the better today. Actually luck has little to do with it. It’s your attitude that creates your world, so start smiling – and winning – again.
leo,You may not be a team player by nature — unless it’s as the team leader — but cooperation has its benefits and what you do with other people today will have a bigger effect than what you do on your own. Everyone benefits.
leo,You will be in the spotlight this weekend, which is nothing new, but don’t expect others to be as admiring as they have been of late. If there are any flaws in your act you must expect those who envy your popularity to point them out.
leo,Friendships are always important but they will assume even greater significance this week, especially if you are the sort of Leo who is aggressively ambitious. You can’t do it all on your own – but with powerful friends all things are possible.
leo,Something you thought was going well may suffer an unexpected setback over the next 24 hours. Whatever the cause and whatever the consequences it is not the end of the world, so don’t overreact. You’ll come up with a solution.
leo,You don’t have to commit yourself to something if it doesn’t feel right. Others may try to make you feel guilty about leaving them in the lurch but it is your own needs that take precedence. Always be true to yourself.
leo,Get out and about and meet people who share your way of looking at things. On an individual level there is only so much you can do, but acting with others all things become possible. Change your outlook and change the world too.
leo,Others will be happy to do what you ask of them today, so long as they feel that you value their efforts. Say all the right things and push all the right buttons and chances are you won’t have to lift a finger yourself!,leo,It may seem as if you have reached your limits or hit some kind of wall but don’t give up. There are plenty of people out there who will happily help you out but what you need to realize is they can’t read your mind. If you need help – ask!,leo,Everyone has a talent, everyone was born with a special gift, and your aim now is to identify what it is you are really good at and make it the centerpiece of your life. Fame and fortune are yours for the taking – if you really want them.
leo,Forget about doing things purely for yourself and try to do what benefits the world as a whole, or at least a wide range of people. What you need to remember is that what you do for others always comes back to you in the end.
leo,There is so much you want to do in life but you are beginning to wonder if time and opportunity have passed you by. No they have not. It’s not really about time, it’s about motivation. What can you do now, this very minute? So do it!,leo,Friendships and group activities are highlighted today and throughout the week, so don’t you dare spend all your time indoors. Get out into the world and mix with all sorts of people – every one of them will have something to teach you.
leo,If you need advice of any sort today don’t be afraid to ask your friends what they think. The current new moon means they will help in any way they can, but you need to ask them first – they won’t just offer their opinions.
leo,Your confidence will get a boost today and you will be a lot more relaxed about your social and professional status. One door may have closed to you but within a matter of days another door will open. Have the courage to walk through.
leo,You seem to be endowed with almost limitless energy at the moment and are getting so much done that it’s unlikely you will let up any time soon. Remember though that in the long-term it is quality work that counts, not quantity.
leo,You will get the chance to do something extraordinary this weekend and if you are smart you won’t let it pass you by. Get out there into the world and be dynamic, dramatic and daring. You’re a Leo – everyone expects you to be larger than life!,leo,A short-term loss may be annoying but chances are it will become a long-term gain, so don’t fret too much. If you recently made some sort of agreement or pact with someone make sure you stick with it. If you don’t, your reputation will suffer.
leo,A number of strange, even bizarre, thing are likely to happen over the next 24 hours but none of them can do you any harm so don’t take them too seriously. More to the point, try not to take yourself too seriously.
leo,This is probably not a good time to commit yourself to a new plan or project. The Sun linked to Pluto, planet of power, means that certain people cannot be trusted, no matter how upbeat they may be about what you are doing together.
leo,You need to raise your sights and pursue interests that are worthy of your time and your energy. What they may be should be a little clearer after today, so keep your eyes and ears open – and let your inner voice guide you.
leo,Something will happen today that makes you wonder if you have been too hasty in reaching certain conclusions. Just because some people have a way of life that is radically different to your own does not make them mad or bad.
leo,You will be on the receiving end of some criticism today but don’t overreact as that may make matters worse. Is there some truth in what they are saying about you? Everyone has faults – yes, even a Leo. Maybe you should listen and learn.
leo,This may be a rather tense time for you but nothing bad is going to happen. Keep telling yourself there is nothing to worry about and keep your mind occupied so it does not have time to wander in negative directions.
leo,Resist the urge to put your thoughts into words – if not you’ll cause the kind of storm that drenches everyone, including you. A few days from now the situation will have changed and criticism will be unnecessary, so bite your tongue.
leo,You may find it difficult to control your temper today but that’s okay. Sometimes you need to let off steam and with Venus strong in your chart at the moment loved ones, work colleagues and even employers are likely to forgive you.
leo,It would be nice if everyone was as enthusiastic about life as you are but it isn’t going to happen. All you can do, today and every day, is to live with a smile on your face and a song in your heart and be a wonderful example.
leo,Much as you might like to help a friend or relative today if they give off signals that they want you to keep your distance then you must respect that. You will only make matters worse if you interfere where you’ve not been invited.
leo,You may be tempted to push yourself even harder today, both physically and mentally, but is that such a good idea? You are already moving fast and living close to the edge – one wrong step could send you over the precipice.
leo,The full moon could have you doing things and saying things that will cause problems of a romantic nature. Handle affairs of the heart with a great deal of care over the next 48 hours. Remember: others will take your words at face value.
leo,You seem to believe that you can get away with anything at the moment but watch out you don’t get carried away and start believing you are untouchable. Be bold and be brave but don’t ever believe you are immune to life’s setbacks.
leo,If you cut corners in any way, shape or form over the next few days you will be found out and the results are unlikely to be pleasant. People in positions of authority are watching you closely, so do everything by the book.
leo,Be careful you don’t let slip any personal information today or you could find it being used against you by a rival. Sometimes you can be too trusting for your own good. Not everyone is as open and honest as you.
leo,Others may be talking about you – and what they are saying is unlikely to be flattering – but what of it? You are big enough and bold enough to shrug it off and keep moving forward. At least you do things that are worth talking about!,leo,Everything is going so well for you at the moment, to the extent that you are even prepared to forget long-running feuds with colleagues and relatives. Make the most of it as it’s unlikely to last, but while it does you’ll feel great.
leo,People around you will be rather moody today, which in turn is sure to get you annoyed. Before the situation spirals out of control remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things it’s of little importance. Keep a sense of perspective.
leo,If you play hard to get today you may send people the wrong sort of message. For one thing they may believe you no longer care, which of course isn’t true. Make yourself available, tiring though it may sometimes be.
leo,Keep things in perspective and don’t let anything upset your emotional equilibrium. The Sun’s entry into the most sensitive area of your chart means this is a time for quiet reflection rather than robust action. Relax both your mind and your body.
leo,You will have to make efforts above and beyond the call of duty over the next few days. There is, of course, a danger that you might exhaust yourself but it will be worth the effort in the long-term. Your future looks remarkably rosy.
leo,Friendships are under excellent stars today, so if you are bored with your home life or your work seek out people who make you feel glad to be alive. There is nothing Leo likes more than being with people who are on the same wavelength.
leo,Don’t worry too much about keeping things civil today. If you’ve got something to say then come right out with it and, if certain people don’t like it, too bad! You are under no obligation to be nice, especially to those who don’t deserve it.
leo,Don’t keep your plans to yourself. Let others know what you intend to do and invite them to join in if they have something to offer. This is a great day for strengthening bonds that may have come a bit loose of late.
leo,If there are any ill feelings between you and a loved one you must sort it out over the next 24 hours. Yes, they can at times be a pain. Yes, they can at times infuriate you. But bearing grudges is always self-defeating.
leo,You have nothing to fear and everything to look forward to and the more you repeat that phrase to yourself today the more likely it is you will have a great time. Don’t forget: your guardian angel is always watching over you.
leo,You seem to be lacking in purpose but what happens over the next two or three days will give you a target to aim for again. Creatively and artistically you need to look for more up-to-date ways to express yourself.
leo,Have faith in your abilities and don’t be afraid to take on new responsibilities. Mercury, planet of the mind, moves in your favor this week, so you should find it easy to inspire yourself. What can you do? Anything and everything.
leo,If you join forces with like-minded people over the next two or three days you will accomplish something remarkable. It may not be possible for one lone individual to change the world but many minds and hands working together can do it.
leo,It may annoy you that others are dithering over what should be a simple decision but try not to let your anger show. If you do it will encourage them to drag their feet even more and your blood pressure may not be able to stand it!,leo,Find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts and start asking some serious questions of the “who am I?” and “what should I be doing with my life?” variety. Your mind will bring up answers that surprise you.
leo,Something will occur over the next 24 hours that makes you want to let the world know what a passionate human being you can be. The only danger is that you will come on too strong and frighten that special someone away.
leo,Yes, of course, you have a right to say what you think but don’t forget that others have the right to hit back if they so choose. If you clash with someone whose ideas are at odds with your own there could be fireworks today.
leo,The planets warn there is a danger that you will try to force an issue that should be left to work itself out and with the emotional Moon and aggressive Mars both strong this weekend that could be disastrous. Learn to leave things alone.
leo,You will help those who need help more in the long-term if you leave well alone now. People progress quicker by making mistakes and once you recognize that fact you won’t be so eager to interfere. Everything will work out for the best in the end.
leo,You may be tempted to let a rival off the hook today but the planets warn that may not be a good idea, if only because it is likely to encourage others to take advantage of you too. Be ruthless and make an example of them.
leo,You are supposed to be bold. You are supposed to be courageous. So what happened? It’s the Sun’s transit of the most sensitive area of your chart that is to blame – you just can’t face the world at the moment. That’s okay – you don’t have to.
leo,Be creative today. Try something you have not tried before. The Sun’s link with Saturn, planet of success, indicates that if you make an effort you will accomplish something out of the ordinary – something that might even make you famous.
leo,You love your freedom but you have responsibilities like everyone else and over the next few days you will have to knuckle down and do your duty. Social activities will have to take second place for a while but you’ll make up for it later.
leo,What happens today will remind you that sometimes the old way of doing things is best. Fortunately, you have never been one to slavishly follow the latest trend or fashion so it’s unlikely the lesson will be a hard one – for you at least.
leo,Resist the urge to push yourself hard over the next 48 hours because you are not as strong physically as you seem to believe. Your powers of recovery may be remarkable but you have limits like everyone else. Know them and respect them.
leo,You will be feeling at one with the world over the next few days, thanks to the beneficial effect of Jupiter moving into your sign. The only danger is that you could become a bit too laid-back and let others take advantage of you.
leo,The more others say you should be disciplined and respectful of tradition the more you will go out of your way to be rebellious. There is no logical reason why you should follow the rules just because other people say you must.
leo,Jupiter, planet of good fortune, is heading rapidly for your birth sign, so stop worrying about all the things that could go wrong in your life and start looking forward to all the things that will surely go right there’s so many of them.
leo,You have done many things over the past few weeks, some of them good and some of them bad but all of them because you believed in what you were doing. Because of that you have no reason to apologize – not that you were going to anyway!,leo,Someone has been taking liberties and you need to confront them about it. If you leave it much longer they may get the impression that they can take from you as and when they please – and that could lead to major problems.
leo,Like everyone else you have weaknesses and the planets warn that one of them – pride most likely – could be your undoing. Just because everything is going so well for you now does not mean you can let down your guard.
leo,Think carefully before rejecting an attractive offer simply because you will have to pay for it in some way. If something is worth having it is worth making sacrifices for, so weigh up the pros and cons and then make your move.
leo,The Sun joins Jupiter in your birth sign on Tuesday, after which you will have the world at your feet. The next few weeks are going to be truly special and, being a Leo, you don’t need to be told to enjoy every moment.
leo,The more time you spend trying to work out what might go wrong over the next few days the less time you will have for making things go right, and that would be a shame. Worry is, was and always will be a useless emotion.
leo,The time has come to stop hiding your talents and to show the worldwhat you can do. The Sun’s move into your birth sign today kicks off a new solar year and inspires you to pursue excellence in everything you do. Be amazing.
leo,The most important thing now is that you keep reminding yourself that all things are possible. The simple fact is that you alone create the path you take through life and you alone are responsible for it. You are destined to accomplish great things.
leo,Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will make the coming year one of the very best times of your life. What you make of your opportunities is up to you but, looking back, you won’t be able to complain you never had any. The fact is, you’ve got it all.
leo,Most of the time you don’t think too deeply about the meaning of life but this year you will be looking for answers to the bigger questions. Join with people who share your desire to go beyond the mundane. Together you’ll make magical discoveries.
leo,By all means assert yourself and be creative but do so in a way that does not alienate other people. It’s your life and you are entitled to do with it what you see fit but try to see how other people, especially those you love, might be affected by your actions.
leo,Use your imagination. Try to visualize where you want to be 12 months from now and what you want to have accomplished between now and then. Your mind is a powerful tool and the more you imagine something the more likely it is to become a reality.
leo,Treat people fairly this week, even if they don’t deserve it. Just because they have broken the rules does not mean you must do likewise. On the contrary, this is a chance to show that you are the kind of person who always puts principles first.
leo,Someone you meet will inspire you to do more and do better. It’s good that you have a role model to look up to but don’t try to copy who they are in every way. Let your own unique talents and personality come through. Others will soon be inspired by you.
leo,There will be times this year when you could easily pack it all in and head off to where the pressures are not so great – but running away is not the answer. Forget about long-term goals and focus on taking that single next step. You’ll get there in the end.
leo,Forget about what might have been: the past is of no concern. The only thing that matters now is the future. Take each day as it comes and don’t bother looking too far ahead. Your life will always be guided in the right direction.
leo,Your generosity knows no bounds and over the coming 12 months you will go out of your way to make sure that friends and family members have everything they desire. But what is it you desire? There’s no reason why you should not have that as well.
leo,You won’t be short of opinions this year and you won’t hesitate to let everyone within earshot know all about them. Let others get a word in edgeways occasionally as you are not the only one with good ideas. Communication must be a two-way street.
leo,The opportunities that come your way over the next 12 months – and there will be plenty – will require you to move in directions you may never have moved in before. That’s good. Either life is a great adventure or it is nothing. Discover new lands.
leo,There is so much doom and disaster talk around at the moment and it’s getting you down but you don’t have to let it get to you. Strive to be positive over the coming 12 months. Look at life as a wonderful adventure, not as something you should try avoid.
leo,Today’s cosmic influences will help you to view the world with eyes that see deeper and farther than most other people. What you discover will astound and delight you. The world is not only a beautiful place, it has meaning too.
leo,You will have to deal with someone who gets emotional for no good reason. They may be in floods of tears but you must stay dry eyed and focus on what needs to be done. Be sensitive to what is worrying them but be practical too.
leo,Mars and Neptune combine on your birthday in a way that demands you use your imagination more. There is so much you can give to the world creatively and, with the success it brings, so much you can enjoy, personally, professionally and financially.
leo,The planets will give a major boost to your self-belief over the next 24 hours (do you really need it?) and before the day is over you will have started something that has the potential to transform your life. Trust what your heart tells you.
leo,The Sun links with Uranus, planet of changes, on your birthday so strange things will happen over the coming 12 months. But every last one of them will be a good thing too, so be positive and don’t be afraid to tear down the past. It’s the future that matters.
leo,A full moon in your opposite sign is sure to stir up rivalries and there may be a few harsh words going back and forth. That’s okay, it’s all good knockabout stuff and you are not the sort to bear a grudge. It’s all part of the game.
leo,The next 12 months could be the most important of your life. No matter how many times in the past you have criticized yourself for not being more active or ambitious you can make up for them all over the coming year. There’s still time to be amazing.
leo,If there are things you still need to do, things that you might not get the chance to do later on, get working on them today. You could leave them until tomorrow but by then there will be other issues that demand your time and attention.
leo,You cannot go on working your fingers to the bone, especially when most of the rewards go to colleagues and employers. The message of your birthday chart is that you need to cut back on what you do for others – and do much more for yourself.
leo,The more you are put to the test over the coming year the more you will like it. No matter how many challenges you have to face you will overcome them all with ease. You have always known you are the best – now you can go out and prove it.
leo,Either you commit yourself fully to a task or project of some kind over the coming 12 months or you forget about it altogether. For too long it has been neither one thing nor the other, so get serious and, most importantly, live happily with the choice you make.
leo,Both in your personal life and at work others will pick holes in your performance over the next few days, but it’s really no big deal. Your ego is big enough to handle it and, if necessary, hit back at them if it gets too much.
leo,How you choose to look at life has a huge effect on what kind of life you experience. With that fact in mind why not resolve to be positive at all times and in all situations over the coming year? View it as an experiment. See if it makes a difference. It will.
leo,Venus links with Jupiter, planet of good fortune, in your sign, making it easy to attract the things you need into your life. All things are possible now, but one thing matters above all others. You know what it is, so make it your priority.
leo,Your mind is overflowing with big ideas and you can’t wait to get started on them. But the planets warn it might be wise to hold back a bit. Could be an even better opportunity is heading your way. Don’t miss it.
leo,Too often of late you have chased dreams that other people have set for you when you should have been chasing the one dream that means something to you. The message of the stars on your birthday is to just be yourself. You can still make your dream a reality.
leo,You will have plenty to say for yourself over the coming 12 months but it will be what you leave unsaid that has the most positive impact. Every time you are tempted to criticize others try to check yourself and say something inspiring instead.
leo,Do you regret that you did not take a different path through life? Well don’t. Not only is it a waste of time but chances are it wasn’t the wrong path at all. According to the planets your experiences were all for a reason. The path you’re on is right for you.
leo,There will be all sorts of distractions going on around you over the coming year but you will ignore each and every one of them. There are two keys to success: knowing what you want and being totally committed to getting it. You can’t possibly fail.
leo,You will get at least one, and maybe several, opportunities to boost your income over the next few days. A new job is possible but just as likely is getting more money for what you already do. Don’t be afraid to ask for a raise.
leo,You need to cut through the fog of misinformation and get to the root of whatever problem it is that is bothering you. Most likely you will find it is no problem at all, just something that requires a slightly off-center solution.
leo,You want to get on in the world but you also need to set aside time to relax and unwind and be with your family and friends. Forget about work over the next 24 hours – do only what makes you feel good.
leo,You may fall out with someone you live or work with today but nothing bad is likely to come of it. Whose fault it was in the first place is unimportant – what matters is that you come to your senses and move on together.
leo,Life will confront you with a series of challenges that would have most people running for cover. But you’re made of tougher stuff. Amazingly, you will actually rather enjoy being put to the test – it gives you the chance to prove yourself.
leo,There will be more than one occasion this weekend when you come close to blowing your top. Hopefully you won’t go that far because, if you do, you may say something you later regret. Hold your breath and count slowly to ten.
leo,Don’t let financial considerations play any part in what you are planning to do this coming week. By Tuesday at the latest you will realize that something you have been obsessing over is really not worth the worry. It never is.
leo,Let others know what is on your mind. If you keep your thoughts to yourself much longer they will start to eat at you and you may be in for a sleepless night or three, so speak up and see what kind of a reaction you get.
leo,Start aiming higher, both in your personal life and at work. So many times in the past you’ve had chances to do something special but for one reason or another you failed to get started. Now you must, because it may be now or never.
leo,You need to request a favor of someone and because you are not sure what their reaction will be you are not looking forward to the experience. Don’t worry. Whatever it is you need they will give it to you no questions asked.
leo,You are doing more than enough as it is, both in your personal life and at work, so if someone asks you to help out today find a way to say “no”. The last thing you need now is to be taking on even more chores and responsibilities.
leo,If you need to approach someone for financial assistance then do so this weekend, but don’t automatically assume they know what it is you want. Chances are they are completely unaware of your troubles, so spell it out for them.
leo,You may want certain things to stay as they are, to never change, but you should know by now that everything changes in the end. Stop trying to hold on to the past and reach out to the future in all its unpredictable glory.
leo,The choice you are faced with this coming week is simple: do you listen to your conscience or do you let greed be your guide? You know what you should do, of course, but your lower nature won’t make it easy for you.
leo,You may be shocked by what you see or hear over the next 24 hours but you are strongly advised to mind your own business. Yes, from your point of view it seems wrong, but there are other ways of looking at the situation.
leo,Some people delight in getting ahead at other people’s expense and you are likely to encounter one such individual today. All you can do is keep your wits about you and not be taken in by offers that sound too good to be true.
leo,With Neptune, planet of illusion, up to its tricks today you could easily make a foolish mistake – and if you do it’s unlikely others will be able to get you out of trouble. Know your limits and don’t be tempted to go beyond them.
leo,It may seems as if everyone else has been out and about and having fun while you’ve been stuck at home or at work but don’t sweat it. Your turn will come, and soon, so keep doing what you’re doing – and doing it well.
leo,Any bad feelings you have about a career or creative move you are planning to make will disappear over the next 24 hours. You should know by now that the only thing worth fearing is fear itself. Whatever it is that inspires you, just do it.
leo,One of the best times for getting things done begins today as Mars moves into the most creative area of your chart. Never mind that you have tried and failed before, what matters is that you WILL succeed now – IF you get started!,leo,It may feel as if your luck will last forever but the planets warn the hand of fate won’t always be working in your favor over the next seven days. Make sure you have a back-up plan, especially if there is money at stake. ,leo,You can sense that something is wrong and you know better than to ignore your instincts. Where both personal and career issues are concerned don’t wait to see how things develop – take the initiative and act immediately on your suspicions.
leo,A more light-hearted approach is called for today, especially if you are the sort of Leo who tends to get uptight about things over which you have no control. Whether you laugh or whether you cry the final outcome will be the same. So laugh.
leo,The successes and triumphs of recent weeks could still easily be reversed, so don’t start thinking you have cracked it and no longer need to make an effort. You’ve come so far and achieved so much – don’t slow down just before the line.
leo,You have been held back too long and are desperate to spread your wings. You will get the chance not long after the Sun changes signs on the 23rd. but for now stay where you are and, most importantly, finish what you started.
leo,However difficult your current situation may be you will handle it with ease. What you need to realize is that whatever you have to face, today or any other day, is what you are meant to face. On the cosmic level it’s all good.
leo,There will be times over the next 48 hours when you feel as if you are the only one who does not know what’s going on. Maybe that’s true, but even if it is it really doesn’t matter. Everything will change next week, so why worry?,leo,The planets warn you could lose out financially if you say something rash this week. You are entitled to your opinions, of course, but maybe you should keep them to yourself for the next 48 hours. After that you can say what you please.
leo,You may fear losing something you have grown attached to but if it’s got to go it’s got to go and there is nothing you can do about it. You can save a lot of heartache by letting go now rather than hanging on until the very last moment.
leo,If you have done something you are proud of then by all means shout about it and let everyone know. No doubt there will be one or two people who find it hard to hide their jealousy but your true friends will be delighted for you.
leo,Try not to react in an emotional way to what is basically a practical problem. Today’s new moon will bring positive signs that you are moving in the right direction at last but you must make sure your head rules your heart.
leo,Something you said a while back was taken out of context and a rival is now using it against you. Set the record straight today. They need to be reminded that no one, but no one, gets the better of Leo – not now, not ever.
leo,Don’t think about all the bad things that go on in the world – think about how you personally can make it a better place in some small way. What is your special talent? How can you use it to make people smile? Get to it!,leo,What happens this weekend may catch you unawares but looking back you will have to admit that the signs have been there for quite a while – you just chose to ignore them. Now though you have no choice but to act. Be decisive.
leo,You may have a long, hard slog ahead of you before you reach your final destination but the planets will endow you with plenty of energy over the coming week. Use it wisely and you will soon be taking giant steps to success.
leo,Let fate take its course over the next two or three days and don’t try to force an issue that will most likely resolve itself. Too often of late by trying to solve one type of problem you have accidentally created another, so leave well alone.
leo,Why are you worrying so much about what might go wrong when just about everything in your life is going right at the moment? Maybe that’s the problem – maybe you fear your lucky streak is a mistake and will end soon. No it won’t.
leo,If you need to take stock of your money situation this would be a good time. However, don’t get so caught up in dollars and cents that you view everything as either profit or loss. You can’t put a cash value on fun or on love.
leo,Not all change is disruptive – sometimes it can be the best possible thing to happen. Bear that thought in mind today if you feel that things are moving a bit too fast. Before the week is out it won’t be fast enough for you.
leo,Don’t waste time worrying that what you have to say might make you unpopular – say it loud and get it over with. You have an important message to convey and personal feelings cannot be allowed to get in the way.
leo,Take extra care this week if you are on the move – and watch what you say too. Wednesday’s lunar eclipse means that others are likely to be more touchy than usual and minor disputes could easily escalate into major confrontations.
leo,Travel and all forms of communication are highlighted over the next seven days, so make sure you plan your comings and goings well and make sure you let others know where you are off to and why. Don’t leave anything to chance.
leo,According to the planets you are trying too hard. What you need to do now is to sit back for a while and let life come to you. Beyond a certain level more effort becomes self-defeating and you are way beyond that level already.
leo,Don’t be afraid to rock the boat a bit today – in fact, rock it a lot. You don’t have to be aggressive but you do have to be assertive and you do need to let others know that, no matter how much they disagree, you will do your own thing.
leo,Others may be willing to listen to your opinions today – they may even be impressed by them – but will they act on what you suggest? Probably not. Don’t worry too much about that, just make sure you live up to your own ideals.
leo,You have been experiencing a lot of emotional ups and downs of late and need to find a balance between being concerned about personal issues and laughing at them. The many good things in your life will cancel out the one or two bad things.
leo,You are in the enviable position of being able to ignore the kind of issues that other people are finding it difficult to cope with. Use the time it frees up to get on top of your workload, then get going on a new plan or project.
leo,You have so much energy at your disposal but are you making the best possible use of it? Probably not. The coming week will bring new opportunities to be creative and original, both in your personal life and at work. Don’t you dare waste them! ,leo,You may not be as energetic as you would like to be as the new week begins but maybe that is no bad thing. Sit back today and watch the world go by. Sooner or later the opportunity you have been waiting for will come your way.
leo,Try not to take life quite so seriously over the next 24 hours. You may still be anxious about certain issues but with Jupiter in your sign linked to values planet Venus today you can be confident it will all come good in the end.
leo,You may not be that interested in what family and friends are up to today but you should get involved anyway. Today’s Sun-Mars link means it will be more fun than you bargained for. It could even give your love life a boost!,leo,Okay, so your words have been misrepresented, but you don’t have to kick up a fuss about it. Just explain, in plain and simple language, what it is that has upset you so. Most likely it was an honest mistake and can easily be corrected.
leo,Make an effort to get on top of your workload before the weekend begins. There is so much going on socially at the moment that it would be a shame to miss out because you have fallen behind on your must-do tasks list.
leo,It will help if you take a more laidback approach to domestic issues over the next few days. The solar eclipse in midweek makes that the perfect time to let loved ones know you don’t hold grudges – in fact you find it all rather amusing.
leo,You can be brutally honest at times and with communications planet Mercury linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, today there is every likelihood you will say something that shocks those around you. Good. They need shaking up.
leo,You know what needs to be done and you know it must be done now. You have been working up to this moment for weeks, months, maybe even years, so get your act together and get moving – and once you are moving don’t stop.
leo,If you take notice of the way certain people are acting it will be obvious what needs to be done to resolve whatever problems there are between you. It is not a question of you being right and them being wrong, or vice-versa – you’re just different, that’s all.
leo,You need to be alert and you need to be willing to take a risk or two if you are to benefit from the changes taking place around you. You will also need to be less thin-skinned than usual as some people can’t help but be critical.
leo,There may be some irritating things going on at the moment but don’t overreact. A loved one is not behaving badly because it is their nature but because they need time alone. Leave them be for a while – and stop trying to cheer them up.
leo,Stop feeling sorry for yourself and redouble your efforts. You of all people should be aware that we only get out of life what we are prepared to put in, so put in what you can and sooner or later your efforts are sure to be rewarded.
leo,You may want to be certain about something before you act but the planets insist that you put doubts behind you and act decisively. Listen to what your inner voice tells you. It may not seem logical but deep down you know it is right.
leo,Why do you fear that time is passing you by? Why do you fear that if you don’t act now you will never get another chance. You will always get another chance, and another and another after that, so lighten up and live in the moment.
leo,A sudden insight into a money issue will convince you there is nothing to get worked up about. But others won’t be so lucky and will be running about like the proverbial headless chickens. Do what you can to calm them down.
leo,Don’t get uptight if things don’t go the way you want them to go. The best way to deal with challenges is to meet them head on, to place yourself in a situation where you are forced to find a solution. You are tougher than you think.
leo,Everything in life has a meaning but sometimes it can be hard to see how it all fits together. You may not get the results you expected today but don’t worry – in the greater scheme of things you are making substantial progress.
leo,You have put a great deal of effort into making a relationship work and you have no intention of letting it fail. With that in mind make sure you don’t overreact in midweek if certain people start behaving strangely. It’s no big deal.
leo,The Sun and Pluto link well as the new week begins and the message it has for you is that you need to find more harmonious ways to link your home life and your work life. Changes are needed to restore some sort of balance. ,leo,You need to find a better balance between your home life and your work life. Loved ones will give you the support you need but only if you are prepared to find time in your busy schedule to ease their doubts and fears.
leo,Certain areas of your private life may be chaotic but that is no reason why you should want to change everything. Focus on one task at a time today and don’t let domestic worries, in particular, detract from equally important issues. ,leo,If you find yourself under attack from a friend or colleague today, ask yourself why they are so angry with you. Could it be you have failed to live up to your side of a bargain of some sort? If so, apologize and make amends.
leo,You need to be a bit more open-minded than you usually are. Why? Because a loved one is committed to a certain course of action and, whether you like it or not, they are going to see it through to the end. Support them 100 per cent.
leo,You must remain objective about an issue that has the potential to cause problems. The last thing you want is to be dragged into the kind of emotional showdown from which no one escapes unscathed. This is the worst possible time to choose sides.
leo,Don’t waste time lamenting the chances you have wasted – they are now in the past and should be forgotten. What matters now is that you resolve to take advantage of the next opportunity which comes your way. Here it comes now. ,leo,If you try to play mind games with other people today you could find your tactics backfire on you. To you it may be a bit of fun but some people are passionate about their beliefs and if you antagonize them you are asking for trouble.
leo,You will have to deal with someone you don’t much like today but there does not have to be conflict. You can easily avoid a confrontation if you keep your wits about you. Be witty too – laughter always brings people together. ,leo,You worry that you are being forced to move in a certain direction, a direction you don’t want to go. In which case you have no alternative but to dig in your heels and refuse to budge another inch. It’s your life – take control of it.
leo,There will be several heart-warming moments today but don’t let them detract from other important matters. A new relationship may be a lot of fun but family and financial issues have to be dealt with too – and dealt with quickly.
leo,The message of the stars today is that it’s a waste of time to worry – about anything but especially about money. A financial matter must be left to run its course. Maybe you could have done more to influence the outcome but it’s too late now.
leo,Your social life will be amazing over the next 48 hours. And with Venus moving into the most dynamic area of your chart there could be a new love interest too. You will certainly be ridiculously attractive – like usual, only more so by far!,leo,Even if you fear that you might hurt a loved one’s feelings you must tell the truth. The planets indicate that, like it or not, it is your responsibility to reveal some rather disturbing information. Say it tactfully, but also as if you mean it.
leo,Never be afraid of your feelings, even when they are negative in nature. If you are annoyed about something there must be a reason for it. In the long-term you may choose to forgive and forget but by all means get angry today.  ,leo,You have so many good ideas but for some reason you are reluctant to do much with them. Something you think of today has the potential to transform your existence, but only if you have more confidence in yourself as an ideas person.
leo,If you apply a small amount of pressure in the right place today you will accomplish something huge. Act as if you have total self-belief – even when you don’t – and others will be so intimidated they will help rather than hinder your efforts. ,leo,No matter how difficult it has been resolving a dispute today’s cosmic picture will help you find the perfect compromise. You may have to give a little more ground than you expected but it should not be a massive blow to your pride.
leo,It may annoy you that a friend keeps saying one thing while doing the opposite but don’t let your anger show. The best approach is to pretend it does not bother you, while making secret plans to remove yourself from their presence. ,leo,No secrets are safe when you are around – you have a knack for sniffing out details that others would prefer the world not to know. Not that you intend to tell everyone – knowledge is power only when you are the one who possesses it. ,leo,If you make the effort to understand something that does not naturally appeal to you there is a good chance you will discover it has a hidden charm. Maybe you should be a little more open-minded about things you don’t understand.
leo,What you want to do and what you are expected to do may be different things but if you are smart you will find ways to combine duty and pleasure. Do you enjoy what you do, or do you do what you enjoy? Do both!  ,leo,You like to be free to do things on the spur of the moment and nothing will stop you from following your instincts over the next 24 hours. Just make sure you don’t go too far and follow them to a place you cannot get back from! ,leo,The main thing to remember today is that a loved one does not mean the negative things they have been saying. Like you they are under a lot of pressure at the moment and that inevitably affects the way they speak and act. ,leo,Make a wish today, because there is every chance it will come true. You may not get what you want immediately but the planets indicate that by the start of next week you will see a major, and better, change to your fortunes.
leo,If a friend or work colleague asks you to do something you believe is unethical you must refuse, even if you feel you owe them a favor. The best favor you can do them by far is pointing out why they need to rethink their attitude.
leo,The Sun in Sagittarius will provide you with new openings and opportunities and all you have to do is take advantage of them. Creatively this is a wonderful time of year for you, so be bold and make a start on that big project you’ve been planning.  ,leo,Over the next few days you will get the opportunity to put right something that has been wrong for months, maybe years. You may have to act in a provocative manner when Mars changes signs on Thursday but it’s in a good cause.
leo,Now is the time to get started on a task you have been avoiding. With Mars and Saturn on good terms today you will find it easy to concentrate and before you know it the job will be done. Then it’s on to the fun stuff. ,leo,You don’t have to be nice for the sake of it, and you certainly don’t have to be nice if you feel that someone is trying to hustle you. The planets indicate that the best way to protect yourself is to go on the attack. Not tomorrow – now!  ,leo,The best way to deal with a money worry is to ignore it completely. Focus your mind on partnerships instead and you will find there is plenty to be positive about. A romantic relationship is about to enter a more passionate phase.
leo,You can perform an important service for a work colleague today, a service that will put them in your debt. You will help them out of the kindness of your heart, of course, but it’s nice to know you can call on a favor in return. ,leo,You may be easygoing by nature but the approaching full moon warns you need to stay sharp over the next 48 hours. Also, don’t say things just to make others feel good – be true to yourself and express what you really believe. ,leo,The reason you have not been getting along with a certain person is because you have been trying too hard to impress them. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? You’re a Leo which, among other things, means they should try to impress you!,leo,As Jupiter turns retrograde in your sign on Monday you must do things strictly by the book. There are certain rules and regulations that must be followed and if you try to cut corners you could upset some very important people. Not good.
leo,There are so many cosmic influences working in your favor now that you can’t help but feel delighted with life. However, as luck planet Jupiter turns retrograde in your sign today don’t take too much for granted. Circumstances can change fast.
leo,Be enthusiastic about what you have to do today. Even if it is the last thing you want to be doing you have no choice but to see it through to the end, so you might as well enjoy it. Find ways to get inspired. ,leo,You have so many good ideas swirling around inside your head but how many of them will amount to anything? If you are not sure which of your ideas have selling potential don’t be afraid to ask someone who is likely to know.
leo,Put your own needs first today and don’t feel in the least bit guilty about it. Some people may say you are selfish, and maybe you are, but what of it? You have desires like everyone else – and every right to satisfy them. ,leo,Use your time and energy wisely today. It does not matter how much work you have to get through before the weekend you must not finish what you have to do too quickly. Get it right the first time, no matter how long it takes.
leo,If you have secret feelings for someone you are advised to keep them a secret, at least for the time being. Most likely they feel the same way about you but both of you have other duties to take care of this weekend.
leo,Someone you don’t much like will rub you up the wrong way in a big way this week. Will you lose your temper? Of course you will and you are right to do so. Once they see how angry you are they will stay out of your way.
leo,If someone annoys you over the next two or three days they are sure to regret it. You are in no mood to turn away from trouble or turn the other cheek, in fact you will go out of your way to even the scores. Watch out world!,leo,If you give the impression that you are anxious for success you could attract the attention of those who know how to play on your greed. Also, watch out your ego does not mislead you. Sometimes you can be a bit too sure of yourself.
leo,You seem to be in one of your upbeat moods at the moment, which is great, but the planets warn you could be a bit too optimistic for your own good. Remember, if you start something new you must see it through to the end.
leo,Let matters develop at their own pace today, especially on the work front where things are moving so fast that there is no point in trying to change them. Just keep an eye on what happens and be ready to act when the time is right. ,leo,Someone in a position of authority will flex their muscles and demand that you do things you don’t want to do. Go along with what they want for now but start making plans to put some distance between you early in the new year.
leo,Take care of yourself this weekend, especially if you have been burning the candle at both ends again. The planets indicate that you need a rest after the feverish activity of recent weeks. Nothing is more important than your health. ,leo,Tomorrow’s new moon will in some way or other encourage you to improve your techniques and procedures. They may have worked for you up until now but time waits for no one and if you want to stay relevant you’ve got to move on.
leo,You need to break free of routines and habits that hold you back from realizing your potential and today’s new moon will help. Forget about the little things and look at the big picture over the next 24 hours. There’s a good chance you will like what you see. ,leo,A breakthrough of some sort is about to occur and come the start of the new year you will be milking the applause. Your rivals may say you have been lucky but luck has nothing to do with it – you just worked harder than they did. ,leo,Try to build bridges to people you don’t always get along with. Just because you have different outlooks on life does not mean you cannot be friends, or at least friendly acquaintances. Strangely, opposites often work well together. ,leo,Yesterday you were quiet and reserved. Today you are partying as if there is no tomorrow. Only a Leo can go from one extreme to the other so easily and so quickly. What will you be doing tomorrow? Recovering most likely! ,leo,If someone in a position of authority wants you to do something for them today then most likely you will have no choice in the matter. You can however choose how good a job you do. Make it the best thing you’ve ever done. ,leo,Difficult decisions will be easier to make over the next 48 hours. In fact, what seemed such a hard call yesterday won’t seem in the least bit difficult today, a sure sign that your outlook has changed for the better. ,leo,Try not to work too hard over the next two or three days or you may have to take an extended break early in the new year. Map out a gentle schedule and stick to it no matter how much others may try to make you do more.
leo,According to the planets you have precious little to worry about but you may have to trick your mind into believing that is so. Focus only on good things over the next 24 hours – and good things will be more likely to happen.
leo,If you find yourself being nudged in a new direction over the next few days don’t try to resist. Despite what some people might tell you anything and everything is possible for you now, so start the new year with total self-belief. ,leo,You don’t have to work harder and longer to get something completed before the new year begins. There is no reason why you should work yourself into the ground just because you are falling behind. You’ll catch up – you always do.
leo,Partnership matters will go well in the opening days of the new year and they will go even better if you stop trying to be the boss and treat friends, relatives and loved ones as equals. You don’t actually have to believe they are though. ,leo,The next couple of days will be challenging, especially on the work front where events beyond your control will frustrate you and make you start thinking that you might be happier elsewhere. Maybe this is the wake-up call you need. ,leo,Whatever fights and feuds you’ve had with partners and work colleagues and loved ones in recent weeks put them behind you now and get on with your life. Forgive and forget and move on – not for their benefit but for your own. ,leo,Stop worrying about work issues and focus on having a good time. Affairs of the heart are well starred at the moment and with one special person you are sure to be flavor of the month, for a day or two at least.
leo,If you think you have to come first or be best at everything you may end up exhausted. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart urges you to recognize that the important thing is not the winning but the taking part.
leo,Dealing with other people’s problems will take up a large slice of your time today and while it may be a bore it will also put you in the good books of people whose help you may need in the future. Good deeds are always repaid.
leo,Form a picture in your mind of where you would like to be a year from now and then start doing the things that will make it happen. All things are possible but you still need to look and plan ahead. ,leo,If you find yourself arguing with someone over a contentious issue today you must stick closely to the facts. If you try to bend the truth in any way, shape or form they will find out and it will most likely ruin your case. ,leo,Take no notice if a friend or work colleague tries to terrify you with tales of what might go wrong. According to the planets most things will go your way over the next 24 hours and the few things that don’t can’t hurt you. ,leo,It’s okay to play down differences and find ways to compromise but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you are weak. If you want peace and quiet this weekend you may have to kick up a fuss to get it.
leo,As Mars moves into one of the more intense areas of your chart on Monday it’s quite likely you will be suspicious of certain people for no good reason. Yes, maybe they are after your money, but more likely you are imagining things.
leo,You need to think long-term rather than merely aim for short-term gain. That applies in particular to business and professional matters. Forget about making a quick buck – the more you plan ahead the better off you will eventually be. ,leo,You may be tempted to get involved with something that appeals to your adventurous nature but can you be sure it will work out okay? No you can’t is the answer to that one, but if you knew it would then it wouldn’t be so much fun! ,leo,You are advised not to take money issues too seriously today, not because they don’t matter but because you may well be looking at them from completely the wrong angle. You won’t lose anything by biding your time. You may even gain.
leo,If someone annoys you today – and chances are they will – you won’t hesitate to challenge them. The bad news is they could turn out to be a tougher nut to crack than you expected. Maybe you should just ignore them instead. ,leo,If someone tries to belittle your efforts over the next 24 hours it can only be because they are jealous of your ability to get things done. They are also jealous of your flamboyant style and the way (almost) everyone loves you.
leo,If you find yourself at odds with someone you live or work with this weekend don’t make a big deal of it. Chances are it’s just a trivial difference and can easily be smoothed over. Neither of you really wants a fight. ,leo,There is no point trying to keep secrets from loved ones, not when they know half the story already. When the Sun moves into the partnership area of your chart on Tuesday you will have to come clean about what you’ve been up to.
leo,It is quite likely that you will have a heated difference of opinion with someone today and you must not back down. Others will respect you more if you stand up for yourself, whether or not your opinion is factually correct. ,leo,There is no point trying to keep secrets from loved ones because they know you too well and can sense when you are trying to hide something. Come clean about what it is you have been up to. Chances are they won’t mind at all. ,leo,The planets urge you to keep a low profile today because if you call attention to yourself in your usual Leo way someone may decide to make a target of you. Let others speak up and take the flak for a change.
leo,No matter how much you might like your heart to rule your head today you must not let it. Where money matters are concerned you must push personal feelings to one side and do what’s best for your long-term interests.
leo,There is a ruthlessness about you at the moment, especially in partnership matters where you have no intention of letting anyone, not even those you love, take advantage of your feelings. Try not to be too hard-hearted though.
leo,It does not matter how much the odds are against you over the next 48 hours you will come out ahead of the game. Anyone who doubts that Leo is the most competitive sign of the zodiac won’t doubt it much longer! ,leo,You will gain a lot of respect among the people who matter this week if you put personal feelings to one side and act for the good of the group. Chances are you will also gain financially towards the end of the week. ,leo,Try not to dwell on negative news as the week begins, especially if it involves someone you care for. According to the planets you are taking the situation far too seriously, certainly more seriously than anyone else is taking it. ,leo,You will get the chance to improve your position today but because your good fortune comes at someone else’s expense you may hesitate to take advantage of it. That’s very noble of you but not very smart. There are always winners and losers.
leo,Don’t leave friends and family members guessing about what it is you expect of them. This is one of those times when you must spell things out in words of three syllables or less. It may make them look stupid but you cannot afford misunderstandings. ,leo,You will either draw closer to someone today or you will drift so far apart that you are unlikely ever to get back together again. Partnerships of all kinds are going through changes. In the long-term they will be changes for the better. ,leo,Keep your problems in perspective over the next 24 hours. You may wish that life was easier but in the greater scheme of things your “problems” are hardly worth worrying about – in fact they are opportunities for you to grow. ,leo,If you push yourself hard over the next 48 hours and you will create a momentum that carries you through the coming week. As a Leo you possess so much courage and so much confidence, so set your sights high. Then go even higher.
leo,You may not find it easy to tell certain people how much they mean to you but you must make the effort over the next seven days. Leave loved ones and relatives in no doubt how you feel. They think you’re the bee’s knees too! ,leo,Stop dreaming about what you would like to do and actually start doing it. It does not matter how far-fetched your dream may be, if you start working towards it now it will, one day, come true – maybe a lot sooner than you think. ,leo,Because today’s full moon takes place in your sign you will be more emotional than usual, which has both advantages and disadvantages. Try not to let minor setbacks expand into what appear to be major traumas. They’re not.  ,leo,The pressure will be on today but that’s okay because no one handles it better than you. When the going gets tough the tough get going and one way or another you will go far over the next few days.
leo,You don’t care what others think about your behavior. It may be true that you have gone over the top and offended someone important but so what? If you go through life watching your every word you won’t get much said. ,leo,Be careful how you talk to and deal with loved ones and family members today. You may not mean to give offence but something you say or do could be taken the wrong way and cause all sorts of problems.
leo,If you have romantic feelings for someone then let them know this weekend. The planets suggest they are as infatuated with you as you are with them but, like you, they fear rejection. Let them know you think they’re great.
leo,It does not matter if you have traded harsh words with certain people over the past few weeks because soon you will get the chance to set things right. Chances are they did not take what you said seriously anyway. ,leo,If you find you cannot handle a task on your own today don’t be shy about getting assistance. Friends and family will rally round if you ask them to but if you insist on struggling on alone they won’t lift a finger to help you. ,leo,Make a conscious effort to focus only on the facts today. The so-called experts will tell you this and tell you that but you should take it all with a large pinch of salt, especially when it’s your money they are talking about. ,leo,You will hear something to your advantage over the next 24 hours but it may take a while until you really “get it”. Don’t be reluctant to believe it just because the source of the information has not always been reliable in the past.
leo,You will demand to be the center of attention today and if those you live and work with know what is good for them they will hand you the microphone, help you up on to the stage and let you get on with it. You’re a star! ,leo,It might be tempting to stick your nose in someone else’s business today but if you do you will most likely regret it, especially if the people in whose lives you are interfering know something about you that could be embarrassing.
leo,You may feel out of your depth today but even if you are you won’t come to any harm, so quit worrying. The fact that, for once, the eyes of the world are not on you will give you freedom to come and go as you please.
leo,What you thought was important just a few days ago won’t seem so important after the Sun changes signs on Wednesday. Partnership issues and affairs of the heart will fade in significance as you focus more on business and money matters. ,leo,Don’t waste time worrying about the ethics of what you are planning to do – just get on and do it and let the chips fall where they will. Actions always speak louder than words, so act fast and make sure the job gets done. ,leo,It’s likely you will worry a bit about money issues over the next few days, but that’s okay. Even if you are a bit short cash-wise at the moment the planets indicate you will make good your losses over the next few weeks. ,leo,If your sixth sense tells you that someone is not to be trusted you must not ignore it. Others may say you are jumping at shadows but deep down you can sense that something isn’t quite right, so err on the side of caution.
leo,It may be that what a friend or family member has to tell you has some value in it, but what does your inner voice say? For some reason you are reluctant to trust your instincts at the moment but, ultimately, you can’t trust anything else. ,leo,You are in a helpful mood at the moment, which is nice, but don’t be too helpful for your own good. Do you really want to end up doing so much for other people that you have no time to do anything for yourself? Of course not.
leo,If you get the urge to try something different this weekend, something you would not usually spend time or energy on, then just do it. Some people may say you are losing your mind but what do they know? They certainly don’t know you very well. ,leo,Try not to be too possessive about what you own and earn this week because that could lead to conflict with someone who thinks you should share more. Maybe they are right, maybe you have grown too attached to physical things of late. ,leo,Keep your standards high over the coming week and make sure those around you aim high as well. You will be judged as much on who you know as what you do, so make sure friends and colleagues are pulling their weight. ,leo,Spell out what it is you intend to do over the next few days so there can be no confusion. However, having made your plans public you must stick with them. If you change your mind without warning you deserve all the criticism you will get.
leo,A friend or family member will bend over backwards to help you today and if you are smart you will let them, even though you don’t want to be in their debt. If you need some kind of financial assistance now is the time to ask.
leo,Partners and colleagues won’t be happy if you go back on what you told them just a few days ago. Yes, your priorities have changed since then but if you made promises you must keep them. Then you can move on with a clear conscience. ,leo,Someone will appeal to your sense of duty today but you must not blindly do as they ask. You are more than willing to help but you must be convinced that what you are doing is for the greater good, not just to support their ego.
leo,Don’t stay in one place doing just the one thing this weekend – get out and about, see new places and make new contacts. Some people may not be happy that you come and go as you please but so what? They can’t stop you.
leo,Anyone who says you are too conservative by nature won’t be saying it much longer. This is going to be one of those weeks when, if you do something shocking, it will make you feel good – and do your reputation good too. ,leo,Your opinion about someone you work or do business with will change dramatically today and you will have to admit that you got them all wrong. Talk to them and get to know them better – it could be the start of a beautiful friendship. ,leo,You will go your own way and do your own thing today, and the more others try to persuade you to be more cautious the more risks you are likely to take. And why not? The planets suggest you can’t put a foot wrong.
leo,Can you adapt? Can you change your opinions if you have to? It may not come easy to you but it’s a must today as Uranus, planet of changes, is so strong in your chart. All changes will be good for you, so embrace them.
leo,Today’s full moon suggests you may have to cut back financially, most likely because you have bitten off more than you can chew or have aimed too high too soon. But there is no need to get angry with yourself: even a Leo makes mistakes.
leo,Changes on the work front will move in your favor over the next few days, so be ready to take advantage of new opportunities and don’t feel too sorry for colleagues who fall out of favor. Would they feel sorry for you if the roles were reversed?,leo,You will be in a generous mood this weekend and anyone who asks you to do them a favor is likely to find it granted. Just be careful that someone who does not share your natural honesty does not try to take advantage of you.
leo,Begin something over the next few days that exercises your mind and broadens your horizons. If there is a particular subject you are interested in now is the time to look at it in a little more depth, maybe even study it professionally.
leo,Make an effort to talk over your problems, especially your money problems, with someone who can not only lend a sympathetic ear but can help you with practical advice. You know very well who that someone is – so approach them. ,leo,Set yourself a difficult challenge and go all out to make a success of it. Jupiter in your sign, although moving retrograde, makes this the kind of day when limits do not exist, at least not for you. Aim high, then amaze everyone and go higher still.
leo,Someone who is as different to you as chalk is to cheese will make a big impression on you today, big enough perhaps to change your assumptions about certain kinds of people. It’s simply not true that as a Leo you never change your mind.
leo,There may be nothing wrong with your plans but that does not mean they are guaranteed to succeed. Saturn, the great taskmaster of the zodiac, is urging you to be more realistic about your aims and more modest about your abilities.
leo,Flattery will get you everywhere today – you know the right thing to say to influence people in positions of power. You also know the right thing to say to ignite passion in the one you love. But will you have time for both?,leo,The planets indicate it is time to admit defeat and give up on something that is clearly not going to work. Push your ego to one side and don’t think it reflects badly on you that you made a poor decision. Even Leos get it wrong occasionally. ,leo,What you get is what you deserve and if you did not get what you desired in recent weeks then, obviously, you did not deserve it. That might sound a little harsh but you need to be ruthlessly realistic if you are to do better in the future.
leo,Something will happen today that is both a challenge and an opportunity. What you need to understand is that while the challenge may come from the outside it is the way you react to it on the inside that makes it an opportunity. ,leo,Do something dynamic over the next 24 hours, something that helps work off all that excess energy that has built up in recent weeks. This is also a good time to take a vacation – so long as it’s the kind where you are constantly active.
leo,Someone will annoy you today by saying something that simply isn’t true. According to the planets they are trying to get you to overreact so they can use your words and actions against you, but you are not that gullible – are you?,leo,You like to shock and the planets suggest you will do something outrageous over the next 24 hours. If it’s a joke you will need to make sure that everyone can see it’s a joke. And if it’s not a joke – why are you laughing so hard?,leo,Something you thought of as a problem before won’t be seen as a problem any more, not because you have resolved it but because you refuse to take it seriously. Your attitude will soften and your perspective will change over the next 24 hours. ,leo,You are looking for ways to escape circumstances you feel are holding you back. Be aware, however, that some of these circumstances are not only holding you back but holding you up as well. Watch out you don’t fall on your face! ,leo,Keep what you have to say simple and to the point because the more complex it gets the less likely it is you will be understood. Unless, of course, your aim is to purposely confuse people, in which case by all means let it get complicated. ,leo,Put yourself out for other people. Go above and beyond the call of duty. Let the world see you are willing to make sacrifices. Your efforts will be rewarded in the long-term and, more importantly, you will feel good about yourself right now. ,leo,Something will happen today that makes you realize how much more is possible and how far short of your potential you have been falling. You will get new opportunities to make more of your talents, but the effort must come from you.
leo,You will solve a riddle that has been bugging you for ages – and will kick yourself when you realize just how simple the answer is. Chances are you will experience many such moments over the next few days. Don’t kick yourself too often. ,leo,You are going to be thinking a lot about your work and your reputation over the next few days. But don’t make any big decisions concerning your career just yet because even better options will reveal themselves early next week.
leo,Don’t take on extra tasks over the next 24 hours. With the commitments you already have you are likely to be on the go from first thing in the morning to last thing at night and if you add to your workload you are asking for trouble.
leo,Tone down your act a bit over the next 48 hours, especially if you are the kind of Leo who thinks life is one big party. Others have serious issues to deal with and are unlikely to appreciate your efforts to get them singing and dancing.
leo,You won’t have to make much of an effort this week because this is one of those times when things will get done one way or the other anyway. Sit back and don’t worry if you fall behind in your schedule – you’ll catch up later. ,leo,No one has the right to tell you what to believe or what to do and anyone who tries will feel the rough edge of your tongue. Is that an over-reaction? Maybe, but better you go too far than let them think you are an easy touch. ,leo,You may be tempted to show the world how strong you can be today but your tough guy routine will have more of an effect if you wait until Thursday when luck planet Jupiter is in your favor. Until then, keep a low profile. ,leo,You are determined to move up in the world and if you start making things happen now it won’t be long before you are in a position of prominence. Once you get a taste for power you won’t want to go back to where you were before.
leo,You don’t need to justify what you believe or what you are doing to anyone. Fortunately, with your ruler the Sun linked to Jupiter in your sign today no one will question you with any great enthusiasm. They simply won’t dare!,leo,What you do for others today you will also in some way do for yourself. Friendships and partnerships will not only bring personal satisfaction but at some stage in the future will pay off financially too. Good news for a change.
leo,Anyone who thinks you don’t know how to laugh at life will have to think again over the next 48 hours. The only danger is you might laugh at things which some people take seriously, but don’t let that stop you – it’s their problem, not yours.
leo,Your confidence is returning and in a matter of days those feelings of dread and doubt will completely disappear. The fact is, of course, you had nothing to dread in the first place but somehow you managed to persuade yourself you did. ,leo,With the Sun and Uranus very much on your side there is nothing you cannot do and nothing you cannot possess. But try not to be too domineering or you could make an enemy of someone it would be more sensible to have as a friend. ,leo,Don’t be surprised if something you feel strongly about fails to get much of a response from those you feel should be most concerned. Maybe you are too close to the situation. And maybe it’s not as bad as you think.
leo,Some problems go away if you take no notice of them but the problem you are wrestling with at the moment needs to be dealt with immediately. Yes, you can try to ignore it but there is no way it is going to ignore you.
leo,If you get the urge to try something different over the next 24 hours then by all means follow your instincts. Leo may be a “fixed” sign but you’re not as set in your ways as some people think – in fact you can be quite adventurous.
leo,You will discover something about a friend or work colleague today that answers a lot of questions. What you discover might be amusing but you are advised to keep it to yourself. They won’t be happy if you broadcast it to the world.
leo,You are in one of your party moods at the moment and there will be plenty of dancing and singing this weekend. Don’t listen to those who say you should be more serious about life – they are exactly the kind of people you don’t want to know.
leo,You can and you will be the center of attention over the next few days. The more others try to keep the spotlight pointing at themselves the more creative you will be in finding ways to get yourself in the picture. You’re a star.
leo,A week from now the Sun moves into the career area of your chart, so start making plans about how you want things to develop on the work front. Start thinking too of how you can get well-connected people to help you ,leo,There is so much you want to do and so much you can do but don’t do it all in one go. You may feel that if you don’t act immediately the opportunity will be lost but that’s not true. You have all the time in the world.
leo,Listen carefully to what friends and colleagues tell you today – and, if what they tell you makes sense, act on it immediately. And don’t be so suspicious. Not everyone is looking to make money at your expense. Some people are honest.
leo,Push any problems you have on the work front to one side and promise yourself that you will deal with them next week. The Sun’s change of signs on Monday will sweep them all away and you won’t actually have to do anything yourself. ,leo,You will have a much clearer idea of what is and is not possible thanks to today’s new moon in your fellow Fire sign of Aries. If you expect the best the best will happen, so stop being negative and believe in yourself.
leo,You have never lacked for self-belief but over the next few days you could get a bit reckless, both at home and at work, with disastrous results. You may think you have something to prove but you have proved yourself enough times already. ,leo,Someone who is usually the life and soul of the party is a bit depressed at the moment and you must make it your business to find out what is wrong. Calm their fears and cheer them up. You know just how to make them smile again.
leo,Tell everyone what they want to hear today, even if you don’t believe a word of it and even if you don’t believe they believe it either. You are not in the mood for arguments, so say the right things and enjoy a peaceful 24 hours.
leo,People expect you to be bold and brash, so don’t let them down. But don’t be too enamored of your own brilliance or you may put them off. If you want to impress important people you need to get the right balance between ambition and humility.
leo,Anyone who thinks they can take advantage of your trusting nature will soon learn that you are not so easily deceived. Trusting you may be but stupid you most certainly are not, as they will find out to their cost today.
leo,Something will happen today that catches you off guard and you will wonder how you could have missed signs that, with hindsight, were so glaringly obvious. Whatever the reason, don’t lose any sleep over it – it’s really not that important. ,leo,You won’t hesitate to speak your mind over the next 48 hours but that does not mean you should let the world know everything you are thinking. Stick to the point you are trying to make and keep everything else strictly private. ,leo,Moderation is a must, especially if you are the kind of Leo who likes to get in a fight. Even if you are in the right and the facts are on your side it won’t do you any good if your opponent is bigger and better connected than you. ,leo,Be careful what you say as the new week gets under way because the planets warn you could say far too much. You may have been able to laugh off your big mouth in the past but now others won’t be quite so forgiving.
leo,Tackle tasks and objectives you might not have the confidence or courage to tackle at other times. Yes, powerful people are likely to oppose you but you are pretty powerful too in your own way. Let them worry about you.
leo,If your everyday routine has become a bit too predictable now is the time to do something about it. There will be some serious upheavals in the working pattern of your life over the next few days. Take full advantage of them.
leo,For too long now you have been worrying about your career, your reputation and your place in the world and neglecting the things that bring you happiness, such as friends and family and travel. It’s time to restore a more sensible balance.
leo,Social activities are under excellent stars at the moment, so take time out of your busy schedule to have fun with friends. Also, if there is some kind of cause or social movement that is close to your heart now is the time to get more involved.
leo,Can one good person make a difference? Yes they can, and you will get the chance to prove it over the next 48 hours. Stand up for what you believe in and don’t worry about rivals and enemies. You have right on your side. ,leo,Wherever you go and whatever you do over the coming week the results will not be what you expected. Which is not to say they won’t be good but there will be times when you wonder how you get yourself into these sorts of scrapes. ,leo,Some may say you are being unduly cautious, and maybe you are, but today’s full moon warns this is not a good time to take chances. You know the old saying: “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Things are okay as they are. ,leo,Someone is sure to be offended by what you say or do today but you won’t care one little bit. With Jupiter in your sign you feel you can do as you please, and to an extent you are right, but there may still be long-term consequences.
leo,What others are suggesting may sound enticing but before you go along with their plans try to work out what’s in it for you and what’s in it for them. Chances are you could negotiate yourself a much better deal. ,leo,Do you think with your head or do you feel with your heart? Hopefully you try to do both but over the next two or three days you should favor your heart over your head. Not everything in life needs to make sense.
leo,What you want to do and what you have to do are likely to be two entirely different things today. But don’t let that depress you because you can still enjoy yourself. No one is more creative at finding ways to have fun.
leo,Someone you work or do business with will insist that certain things are done in certain ways this weekend. Don’t try to dissuade them. Most likely they will mess it all up and in doing so make you look good.
leo,You have been trying too hard to win friends and influence people and when you try too hard at anything it tends to have the opposite effect to what you desire. However, don’t take that to mean you should not try at all. ,leo,Someone will say something that hurts your feelings today but don’t take it to heart. Chances are they are motivated by nothing more than jealousy. What are they jealous of? Your popularity, your creativity, your energy – just about everything really.
leo,Creative activities will go well over the next 24 hours and they will go even better if you don’t try to do everything yourself. Get friends and relatives to assist you with the bits you find difficult or boring – they will happily help you out.
leo,Something will happen over the next few days that seems like a setback, but later in the month it will become clear it was exactly the opposite, so stop worrying so much what might happen in the future. Focus on the here and now.
leo,Anything is possible if you want it enough and according to the planets there is one thing you want above all else at the moment. Jupiter in your sign endows you with huge self-belief, so success is all but guaranteed.
leo,The planets warn you will meet someone who tries to dampen your spirits over the next couple of days. They will only succeed if you let them – so don’t let them. Keep smiling and let the world see your sunny disposition remains unbroken.
leo,If you believe you are worth more than you are currently being paid then now is the time to press your claim. Important people will look kindly on you during the early part of the week, so speak up and make sure you get heard. ,leo,You will be putting yourself about over the next two or three days, especially on the work front where you can sense that the present confusion and chaos will give rise to new opportunities. Change is always good, for you at least. ,leo,You seem to believe that there is no longer any danger, that your critics and rivals have all been dealt with and no longer pose a threat. Maybe you’re right, but can you be sure? The planets warn you still need to be on your guard.
leo,You are going to have to get along with all sorts of people over the next few days and the sooner you recognize that fact the better. You may be highly individualistic but you can work with others if you try. So try!,leo,You will see results today, tomorrow and over the weekend for something you started earlier in the year and that’s good because you were thinking of giving up. Stick it out. Show some staying power. The tide is about to turn.
leo,The most important thing today and over the weekend is that you make sure that those you help are those who most deserve your help. It’s a sad fact of life that some people are happy to live on others’ efforts rather than their own. ,leo,You can quite easily ridicule someone’s opinions and make them look silly but is that such a good idea? The planets warn if you make them look bad they will hold a grudge against you for years to come. It’s not worth it. ,leo,It may be true that certain people have not been pulling their weight but don’t make an issue of it until later in the week. If you accuse them too early they will make a big fuss about it and make it seem as if it’s your fault.
leo,There is an art to relaxation and it is an art you will need to master over the next few days. There may be a dozen things you would like to be doing now but there is only one thing you must do – be kind to yourself.
leo,Jupiter in your sign is a wonderful influence and you won’t lack for confidence over the next few days. But can you balance it with common sense? If not you might go over the top and take on too much. Know your limits. ,leo,Whatever else you worry about today don’t worry about money. If you do you are more likely to make a rash decision, the kind you will live to regret. If you are going to worry about anything, worry about worrying too much.
leo,Something you are working on may look complicated but actually it is really quite simple. Talk to someone who knows what they are doing in this area and before long you will be as big an expert as they are, maybe bigger.
leo,Don’t complain too loudly if a friend plays a trick on you today – they are only getting back at you for the many tricks you have played on them. It’s all in good fun, so play along and don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself.
leo,Whatever good ideas you have over the next 48 hours you are advised to keep them to yourself for a while. Retrograde Mercury linked with your ruler the Sun means there is a real possibility that someone will steal your ideas for their own benefit.
leo,You may think you have what it takes to handle an important task on your own but you will make a much better job of it if you seek assistance. You will have to share the profits, of course, but there is plenty to go around. ,leo,You will find something to smile about today – in fact you will wonder how and why you allowed yourself to get so upset over the weekend. The way you look at the world is always more important than what goes on in the world. ,leo,Most likely you will be praised to the skies today. Wherever you go and whatever you do you will hear only good things about yourself. Should you be suspicious? Yes you should. Never trust anyone under the light of a full moon!,leo,You will find your options limited today, both at home and a work, and according to the planets there is nothing much you can do about it. It may not be your way to do nothing but sit tight and wait for the restriction to pass.
leo,Don’t worry about making mistakes, worry only that you might miss out on a glorious opportunity because you were too timid to act. The planets indicate if you take a chance it will pay off, even if the odds are stacked against you. ,leo,Put recent failures and disappointments behind you and focus on all the good things yet to come – yes, there will be plenty of them. Forget all that doom and gloom stuff and make things happen. Anything is possible if you want it enough.
leo,There is no point trying to meet others halfway over the next 48 hours because if you give an inch they will take a mile – or more. Look out for your own needs and make sure others don’t take more than they deserve. ,leo,Your ruler the Sun links with both Uranus in Aries and Jupiter in your own sign this week, so something dramatic, maybe even drastic, is likely to happen. Whatever it is you will handle the challenge with ease. Nothing can possibly faze you.
leo,Jupiter in your sign means you won’t let anyone limit you in any way. You demand freedom of thought, freedom of expression and freedom of movement and if you are denied any those things you will kick up a huge fuss this week. ,leo,Today’s Mars-Uranus link will have you feeling a lot more confident and a lot more adventurous. You will also feel that the things you have been worrying about in recent weeks are no longer worth the effort – and you’re right, they’re not.
leo,Try not to nail your colors to any particular mast today because the things you believe in now will not be the things you believe in towards the end of the week. Your views and opinions are about to undergo a major change, so be flexible.
leo,Try not to upset someone who is way more powerful than you. If they don’t like what you have to say they will almost certainly make life tough for you. You don’t have to flatter them – just don’t say anything you know will offend.
leo,The only danger now is that you might spend too much on other people. With Neptune, planet of illusion, turning retrograde in the wealth area of your chart you will find that cash has a way of slipping through your fingers.
leo,This is a good time for planning ahead, especially if you are the sort of Leo who tends to act first and worry about what you have done later. A bit of careful thinking now could bring huge success later on, so make the effort. ,leo,You may think your ideas are brilliant, and maybe some of them are, but the planets warn you may also be deceiving yourself. Don’t be too proud to ask friends and family members if what you are planning makes sense to them.
leo,You will get another chance to impress an employer or senior colleague and this time you will take full advantage of it. But don’t neglect your home life over the next few days – loves ones need to know they still come first with you.
leo,Reach out and make contact with new people today. Because the new moon falls in one of the more positive areas of your chart you should have no trouble making friends. Group activities of all sorts are under excellent stars. ,leo,The speed of your actions will take everyone by surprise. If a friend is in some kind of trouble you will go out of your way to help them, then you will go a little bit further and take care of the source of the problem too.
leo,Make the most of the good things that happen today and tomorrow because over the weekend the atmosphere will change and you may not be quite so happy as you have been of late. A time for thinking rather than doing is rapidly approaching.
leo,There is no point trying to get along with someone who obviously does not want to get along with you. The more you try to please them the more distant and unfriendly they will become. Accept the situation and go your own way.
leo,You will be attracted to things, and people, that are out of the ordinary over the next 48 hours. You could even find yourself infatuated by something, or someone, you never noticed before. It may not last but it will be fun.
leo,What is there to be afraid of? Nothing at all. Jupiter in your sign will protect you and Uranus in Aries will bring new opportunities to shine. Also, try to be tolerant of people you don’t much like. Maybe they are not as bad as you think. ,leo,There will be times today when it seems as if the whole world is against you but it isn’t true so don’t overreact. However, one particular person does have a bee in their bonnet about your relationship. A clear-the-air talk is needed.
leo,Don’t be too eager to apologize if you annoy someone today – most likely they deserve to be put in their place. If you put down a marker now and make it clear you won’t be intimidated it will save you a lot of trouble later on.
leo,You seem so easily provoked of late. Why is that? Whatever the reason you must make a conscious effort to control your responses today, because if you go too far you will make enemies of people who should be your friends. ,leo,Your views and opinions are likely to change quite dramatically over the next few days. You will certainly become aware of possibilities that did not occur to you before. Too fixed an outlook is the enemy of progress, so be flexible in your thinking.
leo,If you need to kiss and make up with someone then do it this weekend. Also, if you are having second thoughts about travel plans you must speak up immediately. There is still time to change your itinerary – it’s not yet fully locked in.
leo,It may be tempting to throw yourself into your work over the next few days but the planets indicate you should really be slowing down a bit, not speeding up even more. Work and health matters are closely related, so don’t push yourself too hard.
leo,If something does not work out the way you intended it to today your first instinct will be to drop it and move on to something else. However, there are some things you cannot just dump and forget about. Finish what you started.
leo,The change that is about to take place in your life may result in a lot of uncertainty but the planets indicate that when the dust has settled you will realize that, in the long-term, this is a change which will do you nothing but good.
leo,The Sun may be moving through the most sensitive area of your chart but with Venus and Jupiter together in your sign you will still be the life and soul of the party. Start the celebrations now and keep them going through into the weekend.
leo,You have endured a lot in recent weeks but the fact is your trials and tribulations have made you stronger, not only physically but emotionally too. What happens this weekend will give you the chance to put your strength to good use.
leo,There is so much that needs changing in your life but don’t start changing things without some kind of blueprint or strategy. Fortunately, as the week moves on you will be more inclined to think before you act – always a sensible policy.
leo,Don’t take it to heart if someone seems to be avoiding you. The fact is you have been giving off some rather heavy vibrations of late and they find you a bit scary. Take it as a hint that you need to be a lot more laidback.
leo,Don’t push yourself too hard today, not even if you are behind in your workload. You will catch up with ease later in the month, so there is no need to worry and no need to force yourself to do things that do not excite you. ,leo,You may not understand why you feel a certain way but you must not ignore your emotions. If you want to think clearly today it will pay you to shut yourself off from outside influences for a while – but only a while.
leo,With both Venus and Jupiter moving through your sign at the moment you are responsive to other people’s moods and needs. However, watch out that their negative feelings don’t start to have a negative effect on you. Misery loves company.
leo,What happens today will touch you deeply and magnify your feelings to such an extent that you may not be able to control yourself. If you do lose your cool you must make amends as soon as you come to your senses again.
leo,This is the time to face up to aspects of your personality that you usually do your best to hide or ignore. Everyone has negative qualities but not everyone tries to channel them in a positive direction. But you’re not everyone, you’re a Leo!,leo,You will have to deal with some unusual people over the next few days, the sort of people you would normally try to avoid. On this occasion though you may find that opposites attract – or at least don’t repel as much as they used to.
leo,Why are you panicking? What could go wrong? What you need to remember now is that with so much cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart you have a tendency to look on the dark side. Lighten up, it’s life!,leo,Your main problem at the moment seems to be that you are worrying about things that will probably never happen. Fortunately, your worries will fade later in the month when both the Sun and Mercury move in your favor. Until then, relax.
leo,You seem to be in a negative frame of mind at the moment but you really should cheer up a bit. You have so much going for you and so much to look forward to. If you can’t see that now, don’t worry, you will soon. ,leo,Do what makes you happy rather than what makes friends and family happy. If you don’t feel like socializing or traveling or communicating over the next 24 hours, then don’t. This is more a time for thinking and feeling than doing.
leo,Things that made no sense to you at all a short while ago will make perfect sense today and over the weekend and by the time the Sun moves in your favor on the 23rd you will wonder why you found it so hard to get your head in gear. ,leo,Certain tactics may have worked well in the past but that does not mean they will work well in the future. Make a point of looking for unusual solutions to everyday problems over the next 48 hours – they are more likely to succeed.
leo,The Sun moves in your favor on Thursday, giving you something to celebrate. With Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, moving in your favor too there will be no holding you back – you have lots to say and you intend to say it loudly! ,leo,You should be counting your blessings now as life is good and about to get a whole lot better. Keep thinking positive thoughts and keep telling yourself that you are destined to do something special with your life – because you are. ,leo,You will need to keep your wits about you today, especially when dealing with people you don’t know if you can trust with your money. It is unlikely that anyone is trying to cheat you intentionally but you cannot be too careful. ,leo,Your doubts and fears will disappear when the Sun and Mercury move into your sign tomorrow. The most important thing today is that you make sure that you have tied up any and all loose ends. Things left undone are things that cause trouble.
leo,The Sun and Mercury both move into your birth sign today, making this the ideal time to begin something new. You have done lots of thinking and soul searching in recent weeks. Now you can apply what you have learnt about yourself. ,leo,You may have a tendency to stick with what you know and trust but once you do change your way of doing things you go all the way and that’s what will happen this weekend. Others will be amazed how quickly you adapt. ,leo,You may have a tendency to stick with what you know and trust but once you do change your way of doing things you go all the way and that’s what will happen this weekend. Others will be amazed how quickly you adapt.
leo,At times you can be too aggressive and there is a danger now that you will go looking for trouble. Even if you win your fight what you lose as a consequence around the time of Friday’s full moon will not be worth it. Calm down. ,leo,Now is the time to give form to a dream that you’ve had in the back of your mind for many long years. It might seem outrageous to some but the planets indicate it will come true – if you believe you deserve to succeed.
leo,So many things are going right for you now that you are beginning to believe that a breakthrough is possible – and it is. Keep your eye on your number one goal and keep dreaming about a brighter future. It won’t be a dream for long.
leo,There will be times over the next few days when it seems as if the world is against you, but it isn’t true. The approaching full moon will encourage others to undermine your confidence but they won’t succeed. Your ego is far too strong. ,leo,Mercury in your sign warns this is not a good time to say or do anything that might meet with the disapproval of people in positions of power. Yes, there are certain facts that need to be looked at but don’t make a big deal of it.
leo,Something will happen over the next 24 hours that seems unreal – it just does not make sense. The good news is that if you cannot touch it then it cannot touch you, so don’t worry if what happens is not to your liking.
leo,The Sun in your sign means you want to push yourself hard but other aspects warn if you exert yourself too much over the next few days you may later regret it. You are already moving in the right direction, so just keep going.
leo,The odds are very much in your favor now, so make the most of them and swim with the tide rather than fight against it. If you do a good deed for someone today they will do numerous good deeds for you later on.
leo,You will find yourself under a lot of pressure as the new week begins but the planets indicate you can deal with any and all challenges that come your way. Back up your confident attitude with equal doses of common sense and genuine forgiveness. ,leo,A Venus-Jupiter link in your sign will do wonders for your confidence, especially in one-to-one relationships. All the doubts, fears and anxieties of the past will be swept away by what takes place over the next few days.
leo,No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been the next few weeks will more than make up for them. One way or another it will start to go right for you again and your confidence will come flooding back. Get ready to party.
leo,Employers and other important people will go out of their way to help you make the most of your talents over the next few days. First though you need to open up and let them know what it is you desire. They’re not mind readers.
leo,You will have to give up something that you consider your own over the next few days and it won’t be an enjoyable experience. However, its presence in your life is blocking even better things from coming in. Let it go.
leo,Timing is everything and the time to start something new is now, today, this very moment. With Mars moving into your sign even the smallest of efforts will bring remarkable rewards, so don’t let anything or anyone hold you back. Go for it! ,leo,New opportunities will arise over the next few days and you need to be in the right frame of mind to take advantage of them. A financial windfall is a possibility but don’t get yourself in a position where you are going to depend on it.
leo,You seem to be anxious about financial matters at the moment but there is really no need. As Jupiter moves from your own sign to the money area of your chart tomorrow there is sure to be good news of some kind.
leo,You are entitled to feel pleased with yourself for what you have done but what you have achieved in recent weeks is only the first stage: now you must go on and make sure that your stay at the top is long and profitable.
leo,There have been a lot of ups and downs in your life of late and you would no doubt welcome a little stability. That will come later but for now there is another roller-coaster situation you have to deal with. Hold on tight,leo,No matter how hard you try to engage certain people in conversation today you won’t succeed. But don’t take it personally because they are not trying to ignore you or put you down – it’s just that they have so many things on their plate at the moment.
leo,Today’s new moon in your sign means you are able to see things clearly and communicate your ideas effectively. But that does not mean you can take everything others tell you at face value. You may be honest but can you be sure they are too?,leo,You cannot be certain that what you are about to start work on will bring fame and fortune but there is a good chance it will. With so much cosmic activity in your sign it’s not a case of if you will succeed but when you will succeed.
leo,Avoid the temptation to get involved in schemes that promise to make you rich quick. The recipe for success is to have a good idea and to work hard to turn it into reality. There are no shortcuts to fortune and fame – you should know that by now. ,leo,A feud that has taken up too much time and too much energy must be put behind you once and for all. Today’s helpful planetary set-up will give you the courage to make the necessary changes. Hopefully others will have the sense to accept them.
leo,You must take extra care today, especially when socializing, travelling and taking part in artistic activities. Be confident and enthusiastic by all means but don’t fall into the trap of believing that nothing can possibly go wrong – because that’s when it will!,leo,Do you focus on chores and duties? Or do you just enjoy yourself? According to the planets there is no middle way: you must make a decision and stick to it. If you try to get the best of both worlds you may end up with neither.
leo,Aim for your highest ideal and refuse to accept second best. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to relationships. If you forget everything else over the next 24 hours at least remember the three Ls: Love, Laugh and Learn. ,leo,Someone feels you owe them something and they are about to demand that you pay up in full but you must not let them pressure you into parting with cash. Of course, if you owe them a favor then you should pay back the favor in kind.
leo,The Sun leaves your sign this weekend but that is no excuse to leave your responsibilities to other people. The area of your chart the Sun now moves into governs what you own and earn, so if you work hard this week you could come into money. ,leo,Try to avoid any serious confrontations as the new week begins. If you have a point to make you will get the chance to plead your case when the Sun links with Jupiter on Wednesday. Between now and then you should save your energy.
leo,You seem to be on the defensive at the moment but there is really no need as the overall cosmic picture is exceedingly good and will get even better over the next few days. It will get better quicker if you stop worrying so much. ,leo,Think carefully before committing yourself to anything of a financial nature today. You may be eager to boost your earning power but the planets warn there is a real chance that someone is keeping from you facts you need to know.
leo,With the Sun and Jupiter on good terms today you will find it remarkably easy to charm your way to success – and maybe make a fortune in the process. But don’t make claims now that you may find hard to live up to later. ,leo,There may be times over the next 24 hours when your chores and duties become such a burden that you seriously consider getting rid of them all and starting again from scratch. Go for it. Be bold and change your life for the better. ,leo,You may be tempted to give up on something but the planets warn it is likely you are not seeing things straight and that in a matter of days the tide will turn in your favor. Don’t take any drastic decisions over the next 24 hours.
leo,Keep things in perspective and don’t let financial issues dominate your thoughts. The planets are urging you to be positive and creative in everything you do, so don’t sit there waiting for something to happen – go out and make it happen.
leo,There is no need to be suspicious if someone you think of as a rival offers to do something for you. The planets indicate they genuinely want to help you out and, maybe, bring an end to a feud that does not benefit either of you.
leo,It’s good to have high expectations but don’t pass up an opportunity just because it fails to meet your stratospheric standards. The opportunity itself may not seem that remarkable but it is what you choose to make of it that matters. ,leo,You are determined to make something of your talents but don’t use up all your energy making money or getting ahead on the work front because the planets urge you to enjoy yourself too. Friendships and love affairs are well starred today.
leo,There is no point trying to hide your feelings because everyone can see from the look on your face what you think about the current situation. Why would you want to hide them anyway? People expect you to be outspoken, so don’t disappoint them.
leo,You will do something extra special today, something that gets you noticed by the people who count. What that something is only you can decide, but if you do it with style your name will be known by all the right people.
leo,You have huge responsibilities to take care of and you may be tempted to run away from them. Hopefully you won’t take that idea too seriously. The only way to lessen the burden of your responsibilities is to fulfill them to the letter.
leo,Too many times in the past you have allowed opportunities to pass you by but now you are determined to reach out and take what it is that you desire. That’s great, but don’t forget you will have to live with the consequences of your actions. ,leo,You are determined to enjoy the good things life has to offer, and although you may regret indulging yourself later in the week, the next two or three days will be right up there with the best of them. That’s okay. Life is supposed to be enjoyed. ,leo,You would be wise to tighten your belt and put a block on spending that is not absolutely necessary. Yes, you can easily live without all those little luxuries and other goodies you enjoy so much, for a while at least.
leo,You don’t care in the slightest what others say or do – the whole world could be against you now and it would not worry you one little bit. Today, more than most days, you can accomplish remarkable things, because you have total self-belief. ,leo,There is no right way or wrong way to do what needs to be done, there is only the way that works, so if you are happy with the way things are going then carry on and don’t let anyone persuade you to change. ,leo,A money-making opportunity will come your way over the next few days but you must act quickly because it won’t hang around for long. There may be no such thing as a certainty but you can and you must be more adventurous.
leo,An important new cycle is about to begin, one that will help you get more out of life materially. Even a Leo needs to pay the bills and make ends meet and what happens over the weekend will give you new insights into ways to make money.
leo,If you follow your hunches over the next 48 hours you might make a fortune. A sudden flash of inspiration could steer you in a profitable new direction and you must not hesitate to milk the situation for all it is worth – it could be a lot!,leo,You always find it easy to impose your will on others but just because you can do it does not mean you must. Partners and colleagues will do what you ask of them if you ask nicely and treat them as equals, even when they are not.
leo,You can sense that something is wrong and you know better than to ignore your instincts. Where both personal and career issues are concerned don’t wait to see how things develop – take the initiative and act immediately on your suspicions.
leo,A more light-hearted approach is called for today, especially if you are the sort of Leo who tends to get uptight about things over which you have no control. Whether you laugh or whether you cry the final outcome will be the same. So laugh. ,leo,The successes and triumphs of recent weeks could still easily be reversed, so don’t start thinking you have cracked it and no longer need to make an effort. You’ve come so far and achieved so much – don’t slow down just before the final chapter.
leo,However difficult your current situation may be you will handle it with ease. What you need to realize is that whatever you have to face, today or any other day, is what you are meant to face. On the cosmic level it’s all good.
leo,There will be times over the next 48 hours when you feel as if you are the only one who does not know what’s going on. Maybe that’s true, but even if it is it really doesn’t matter. Everything will change next week, so why worry?,leo,The planets warn you could lose out financially if you say something rash this week. You are entitled to your opinions, of course, but maybe you should keep them to yourself for the next 48 hours. After that you can say what you please. ,leo,The Sun remains in the money area of your chart only until Wednesday, so you need to get your act together. There is still time to put your affairs in order and work out how you are going to make up for recent losses.
leo,You may be tempted to give up on something that is taking up a large slice of your time and your energy. Don’t! In a matter of days it will come easier to you and the hard work you put in earlier will pay off in a big way.
leo,Partners and loved ones and friends will know what you are thinking without being told. You will come up with some wonderful ideas about how to improve your life between now and the end of the week. Make more of your talents. ,leo,Someone is feeling a bit depressed and needs you to cheer them up. That someone is you. You will find it easy to calm their fears and remind them that, whatever their problems, life is still wonderful – and you are a wonderful friend.
leo,Make sure you think before you speak or act today. Don’t just assume that because something is amusing to you it will be amusing to everyone else – in fact your sense of humor could get you in a lot of trouble. Practical jokes are a no-no.
leo,According to the planets you are going to be stopped from doing certain things that you want to do, but only so you can use your energy in more positive ways. Whatever else you do, don’t fight fate – the celestial powers- that-be know what you need.
leo,You may be tempted to push your luck and do something you know is morally questionable, and you may even get away with it, but your conscience will prick at you. All actions have consequences, so do only what you know to be right. ,leo,You will be in a forgiving mood as the new week begins and that’s good. But you still need to make sure others know you won’t allow yourself to be taken advantage of. Don’t give them the impression that you are going soft in your old age!,leo,Just because certain ways worked well in the past does not mean they will work well in the future. Make a point of looking for unusual solutions to everyday problems over the next 24 hours – they are the ones most likely to succeed.
leo,Be wary of anyone who goes out of their way to do you a good turn today. That might sound cynical but the planets warn it is possible that someone you upset a long time ago is looking to get even with you now. Be careful. ,leo,You feel you ought to make it up to someone you have in some way or other been neglecting of late. That’s fine but don’t be too generous for your own good. What others want most from you is your attention – they don’t care about cash.
leo,Friends will go out of their way to assist you over the next 24 hours, so don’t sit there pretending that everything is fine because you know that it isn’t and so do they. No matter how independent-minded a Leo you may be you need help. ,leo,Don’t waste your powers of persuasion on trivia – use them to make a positive difference in the world. Current influences will expand your options, both socially and professionally, and you are sure to find something that inspires you. ,leo,The planets suggest that if someone makes you an offer over the next few days they can be trusted. Don’t hesitate for even a moment, because if you don’t make up your mind quickly a rival will take what should have been yours.
leo,What happens today and tomorrow will bring certain resentments out into the open where they can be dealt with once and for all. For too long you have pretended that they did not exist – now you have no choice but to confront them. ,leo,Try not to panic today, especially if your workload is getting too much for you. What you need to realize is that today’s Sun-Pluto link tends to make you look on the dark side of every situation. Lighten up, nothing bad is going to happen. ,leo,Try not to take anything too seriously over the next 24 hours. With so many changes taking place in your life you need to stay calm and be flexible in your approach to everyday problems. The fact is they are not worth getting worked up about,leo,Money matters will figure prominently now that Venus is joining Mars and Jupiter in the main financial area of your chart. There is a lot at stake at the moment, so do whatever it takes to maximize your profits – and minimize your losses. ,leo,Mercury, planet of the mind, moves out of its retrograde phase today, which among other things will make it easier for you to guess what people are thinking. That ability will come in useful when dealing with individuals you don’t fully trust. ,leo,You make your share of mistakes and you are not afraid to admit it but you are under no obligation to take other people’s errors on your shoulders as well, no matter how broad they may be. Don’t be a scapegoat, not even willingly. ,leo,Make sure you speak your mind over the next few days, even if you know it will offend certain people. Your current cosmic role is not to make others feel happy about themselves but to shake things up and ask some important questions. ,leo,You are in no mood for idle gossip and anyone who wastes your time with meaningless chatter will get a few choice words sent back at them. Stay focused on what is important to you, and if that annoys other people – too bad!,leo,Make this the day you throw out all the emotional junk you have acquired over the past six months or so. Also if a relationship has become a bit too stifling or one-sided now is a good time to start putting some distance between you. ,leo,What is right for you may not be right for someone else, and what is right for them may be wrong for you. You may not approve of someone’s actions but it is not your place to judge them. Live and let live. ,leo,Consider your options carefully today, then act quickly and decisively. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to matters of a financial nature. Somehow you will just know what your rivals are planning. Use that knowledge to your benefit.
leo,Your thoughts may be far away at the moment but you won’t be allowed to neglect your duties for long. Employers and other important people will let you know in no uncertain terms if they think you are not pulling your weight.
leo,The current cosmic picture is making you more critical than usual, both of yourself and other people. Which may be no bad thing but you must be realistic about what you can hope to achieve. Don’t try to be superhuman – just be yourself. ,leo,Certain people are beginning to think that you have forgotten about them, so your priority now is to convince them that they are always in your thoughts. That may not be enough though – they want to be in your plans as well. ,leo,You need to get serious about a long-term ambition. There is every reason to believe that some kind of breakthrough is imminent, but don’t just sit there and wait for good things to land in your lap. Get up and meet them halfway.
leo,The planets warn you could clash with someone who does not share your principles – or maybe has no principles at all. Just remember that you don’t have to fight this battle alone: there are many out there who share your ideals and beliefs.
leo,You may be on a tight schedule work-wise but you must still make time for people who depend on you. Not everyone is as confident as you and those who are feeling crushed by events desperately need a touch of your can-do spirit. ,leo,You will face not one but several challenges over the next few days. The most important of these will be to find out why partners and loved ones are suddenly so hard to get along with. Could it be because they feel a bit neglected? ,leo,Resist the urge to criticize today, especially on the home front where loved ones could be a bit irritable. It would be nice if everyone were as laid-back as you but they are not, so accept them for what they are and act accordingly. ,leo,The planets are urging you to be more positive, especially where money matters and business deals are concerned. Yes, in true Leo fashion you may go too far and later wish you had been more careful, but you will still be ahead of the game. ,leo,Tuesday’s full moon will force you to identify your priorities and decide what it is you want most out of life. If that means rejecting what loved ones and work colleagues expect of you then so be it. The most important thing is that you are happy.
leo,Don’t say or do anything that might meet with the disapproval of people in positions of power. Yes, of course, you believe in yourself and yes, of course, that belief can take you far, but the fact is your rivals are more powerful than you are. ,leo,You have kept your emotions under wraps of late but now you must be a bit more outgoing, a bit more expressive. This is the ideal time to let loved ones know how much you care for them. Don’t just say it – do something that proves it. ,leo,You are finding it hard to hide your anxieties, but why would you want to when there are people you can turn to for advice and support? Leo may be an independent sign but you don’t have to face each and every situation alone. ,leo,You must be decisive today, especially when dealing with partners and relatives. If you give others the impression that you don’t know what you are doing they may lose confidence in you and go to someone else for the advice and assistance they need.
leo,By all means splash out a bit today – spend some money on yourself. You have worked hard of late and are entitled to enjoy what you have earned. Make sure it’s you who gets the benefit and not those who like to sponge off you.
leo,The most important thing this weekend is that you recognize that your views and opinions are as valid as anyone else’s – and that you are entitled to express them. People will follow you if they like what you say – and they surely will. ,leo,If you need a helping hand, or even a shoulder to cry on, don’t be embarrassed to ask. You may feel powerless to change what is going on in the world but only because you are trying to do too much alone. There is strength in numbers. ,leo,What happens over the next few days will have a huge impact on both your work and your home life. The most important thing is that you don’t let the pressure get to you. Stay calm and you will be one of life’s winners.
leo,You need to be more practical where money matters are concerned as cosmic activity in the main financial area of your chart warns you could easily give too much away. Cut back on your spending a bit and on your generosity a lot.
leo,You can make life easier for yourself today by avoiding confrontations and giving others the benefit of the doubt even when they clearly do not deserve it. Why make life more difficult than it needs to be? Smile more. Worry less.
leo,You won’t be thinking straight over the next 24 hours but now that you know that you are less likely to make any spur of the moment decisions that will get you into trouble. Money matters, especially, must be approached with care.
leo,Things seem to have been going pretty well for you of late but that must not stop you from looking ahead and getting ready to meet the challenges that you know are coming your way. Plan your strategy in as much detail as possible.
leo,Yes, you are moving in a completely different direction to everyone else and, yes, that is a good thing. It takes courage to go against the crowd but courage is one thing in which you have never been lacking. You are right and they are wrong. ,leo,Try not to be too wasteful with your resources over the next few days. The approaching new moon urges you to spend more time with your family and less time painting the town red with your friends – and running up huge bills as well.
leo,Chances are you will refuse to see any point of view but your own today and that could put a friendship at risk. Try to understand that what is right for you may not be right for someone else – in fact it could even be dangerous.
leo,There is a danger that you will try so hard to make a good impression that you end up turning people against you. There is no point pretending to be something you are not because others will see through your act. Be yourself.
leo,A new moon in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart is unlikely to have a negative effect on your affairs generally but it could get you thinking that you are falling short of your goals. You’re not. Don’t be so hard on yourself. ,leo,The line between helping a friend and interfering in their personal affairs may at times be difficult to judge but if someone you know needs assistance today you must ride to their rescue with no questions asked. They will thank you for it.
leo,If you have fallen behind in your workload you must either make an effort to catch up today and over the weekend or revise your schedule so that you are not under so much pressure. Are the deadlines you have set really necessary? ,leo,Neptune, planet of illusion, is strong this weekend, so you must make sure that your thoughts are clear and that your words and actions are backed up by facts. Don’t give your rivals and enemies opportunities to make you look bad. ,leo,Do not commit yourself to anything you have not checked out for yourself. Even if a trusted friend tells you there is nothing to worry about you must not take their word for it, especially before Mercury changes signs on Friday.
leo,You will stir up some trouble today by saying things that others just cannot agree with, but that’s okay. You are right to call it as you see it and eventually they will admit you were right as well. But watch your back anyway, just in case. ,leo,As a rule you don’t much like surprises but what happens today or tomorrow will not only surprise you but please you too. If you are invited to a social event you must go along – don’t deny others the pleasure of your sparkling personality. ,leo,Stick to the rules over the next 24 hours because the planets warn if you try to cut corners the powers that be will come down on you hard. Try to understand that not everyone shares your cavalier approach to getting things done.
leo,Let others know what you are worth and let them know that you won’t accept less. Your talents do not come cheap and although some may say your price is too high the fact is many still require your services – even more than before. ,leo,You will have to deal with a rather emotional-looking situation today, one that threatens to bring half-hidden grievances to the surface. Perhaps that’s no bad thing, perhaps you need to face up to your inner demons as well as your outer enemies.
leo,The Sun’s entry into the sympathetic sign of Sagittarius tomorrow marks the start of one of the best times of the year for you. In a matter of days you will get the chance to do something amazing but before then conserve your energy – you are going to need it.
leo,This is one of the best times of the year for those born under your sign, so forget about any setbacks you may have suffered and start looking forward to a time when everything will go right for you again – it won’t be long in coming.
leo,Why are people so demanding? Why do they expect so much of you? Maybe it is because you have set such high standards they think you can do anything. Or maybe they believe they can get away with making outrageous demands. Don’t let them.
leo,Forget about what others say you have to do and do only what you want to do. The Sun in Sagittarius at this time of year means it’s so easy to have fun, so get out and about, see and be seen and do something truly amazing. ,leo,This is a great time to start something new, especially something of a creative nature. If you try your hand at something different today you may find you have a talent that has lain dormant for years – and it could make you rich. ,leo,Romantically and creatively the sky is the limit now. The Sun in Sagittarius endows you with massive self-confidence, to the extent that you believe that all things are possible – and your belief will make it a fact. The sky may not be high enough.
leo,Cosmic activity in the communications area of your chart means you will have plenty to say for yourself today and over the weekend. Make sure that your words are positive and progressive because a lot of people will take what you say seriously. ,leo,As an adventurous Leo you know that the old ways are not always the best but the planets warn there are some areas where you should stick to tried and trusted methods this weekend. Steer clear of fads and fashions – they won’t work for you. ,leo,The best way to make a potentially tough time easier for yourself is to stay cool and keep a smile on your face. Others are more likely to assist you if your attitude is positive and you act as if you are not in the slightest bit fazed.
leo,It may annoy you that a rival seems to be getting the better of an argument but maybe that’s because your own opinions are not as good as you thought they were. Check your facts carefully and, if necessary, be ready to admit that you were wrong. ,leo,You know what is right, you know what is just and you know what it is you must do over the next few days. More than any other sign you have the power to follow things through to the end, so keep going and don’t be afraid. ,leo,If you are bored with your social scene then do something about it. There is a party going on somewhere right at this moment and if you make an effort you can find it. Failing that, throw a party of your own. There must be something to celebrate! ,leo,You may be reluctant to admit that you got it wrong and said things that were untrue but if you want to salvage a friendship that is what you must do. Apologize with good grace. It’s not the words that count but the sincerity behind them. ,leo,Creatively and romantically there is a lot of potential at the moment but today’s Mercury­ Jupiter link could tempt you to go too far. Don’t start anything you may not be able to finish and don’t make promises you may not be able to keep.
leo,If a friend needs a shoulder to cry on you must offer it with no strings attached. They may deserve what has happened to them but it is not your place to make that point. Do what you can to cheer them up – you are good at that.
leo,You have a way with words and cosmic activity in the communications area of your chart will enable you to express your thoughts in a forthright manner. But watch out you don’t say too much too loudly and turn even your friends against you. ,leo,Try not to let your feelings get in the way of the facts today. The Moon’s eclipse of Venus in one of the more emotional areas of your chart means you won’t be thinking straight, so keep your opinions to yourself in case they get you into trouble.
leo,To some people the current outlook may seem a bit glum but you can see the bright side in even the darkest situation, so make it your aim to remind them that life can still be fun. But if they remain unconvinced don’t let them bring you down too. ,leo,Try not to make promises today that you may have to break tomorrow. The best thing, of course, is to make no promises at all but if you feel that you have to at the very least add a get-out clause to limit the blowback, just in case. ,leo,Go your own way and do your own thing and don’t waste even a second wondering or worrying what others might think about what you are doing. The best way to win them over to your side is to act as if their approval means nothing to you. ,leo,Today’s new moon urges you not to limit yourself in any way, shape or form. Creatively and professionally you are at the top of your game, so be active, be ambitious and above all be assertive. You will get what it is you desire. ,leo,Your powers of imagination are high at the moment and your ability to put yourself in the shoes of other people will help you decide what needs to be done to help them. But don’t do it all or you may have no time left for yourself.
leo,Friends and loved ones are looking to you for guidance. Help them by all means but do not attempt to solve their problems for them. If you do too much for them now they will be back again later wanting you to get them off the hook again.
leo,Your confidence could slump today as Saturn makes it easy to see nothing but gray clouds in the sky. Your problems may be all in the mind but the mind is a powerful tool and if you believe bad things are going to happen then they most likely will.
leo,The Sun in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart encourages you to raise your sights and show the world what you are capable of. Don’t allow yourself to be distracted by trivial things, and don’t try to be all things to all people. ,leo,You are brimming with confidence at the moment. The Sun’s journey through Sagittarius may be coming to and end but you still believe that anything is possible, that you only have to put a name to your dreams to see them come true. And they will! ,leo,Keep your options open and listen to advice from people whose expertise in certain areas is better than your own. You may not like to admit that others know best but in some areas they do and you should be big enough to acknowledge that fact. ,leo,Recent weeks have been hectic but this is no time to slow down because there is still a lot to be done before the Sun leaves the most dynamic area of your chart on the 2nd. Creatively, and romantically, there is no limit to what you can accomplish.
leo,Something will happen this weekend that makes you very angry with people in positions of power. Don’t make too big an issue of it but don’t keep quiet either. Power and responsibility go hand in hand. Make sure they know that.
leo,The lesson you most need to learn over the next few days is that a moderate effort, applied consistently over time, will be more successful in the long-term than the kind of all-or-nothing effort you usually favor. Yes it’s boring, but it works.
leo,What you think is a fact today may look like a complete work of fiction tomorrow, so try not to take it too seriously. On the work front especially it might be best not to take anything for granted over the next 48 hours. ,leo,The planets indicate that anything you begin over the next few days will have the stamp of success on it, so long as you start slowly and don’t take silly risks. You may have big ambitions but you still need to take care of your health. ,leo,If you are going to take a risk of some sort, if you are going to put everything you have gained on the line, now is the time. There is no guarantee you will win but the odds are definitely in your favor at the moment, so act.
leo,No matter how much work you have to get through today something will disrupt your schedule. By why should that worry you? Relax. Slow down. Take it easy for a while. Save your energy for a time when you can make things happen.
leo,Before agreeing deals or signing contracts make sure you will be able to deliver on time. If you are not 100 per cent certain that you will be on top of things from beginning to end then maybe it would be best to give it a miss, for now.
leo,You are not the type to get emotional but don’t be so unresponsive today that it seems you have no feelings at all. If you come across as cold and uncaring it will make others less likely to trust you and confide in you in the future.
leo,What comes easy to you over the next few days won’t come so easy later on, so make an effort to get the tough stuff out of the way as quickly as you can. If a project of some kind no longer inspires you, end it and move on.
leo,Every word you say and every move you make affects what happens in the future. Also, as you think today so you will be tomorrow, and how you act tomorrow will build your own future prosperity. Think about that today but think carefully.
leo,Your can-do attitude will impress people in positions of power but don’t make promises you might find hard to keep. And if you have already made some kind of rash promise there may still be a way to get out of it if you act quickly. ,leo,You will get what you want today without really trying. With Venus moving into your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius you exude an aura of confidence that will attract all sorts of people to you. Just be yourself and the world will love you. ,leo,Friendships and group activities are under excellent stars at the moment so the old year should end on a high note and, with luck, the new year will start even higher. Crowds and noisy social scenes are right up your alley, so have a great time. ,leo,Don’t waste your time and energy on meaningless events or social activities over the next few days. Take yourself off to a location where you can be alone with your thoughts. You have some major choices and decisions to make. Make them sensibly.
leo,No doubt you are full of energy and enthusiasm and eager to get 2016 off to the best possible start. But hold on. The planets warn it might be a good idea to check the details of what you are planning. There could be something you have overlooked.
leo,If you reach out and help someone in need over the next few days they will appreciate it very much indeed and will, in turn, reach out and help other people. One good deed could be all it takes to change the world for the better.
leo,There will be a lot of noise during the early part of the week and there will be times when you wish you could switch off the world. But that isn’t going to happen, so invest in a really good pair of headphones instead. Tune out the negativity. ,leo,You will attract the attention of some very important people over the next few days and if you play your cards right you might soon be a VIP yourself. It’s no less than you deserve, of course. The cream always rises to the top in the end.
leo,How much do you trust someone? Enough to let them handle your money? If you are absolutely convinced that a friend or colleague won’t cheat you then by all means allow them to make decisions for you. If not, make sure you stay in control. ,leo,Try not to attach too much importance to what are really quite minor setbacks. What happens today is not nearly so important as your attitude to what happens, so deal with problems as and when they arise and don’t take anything too seriously. ,leo,Because Jupiter turns retrograde today there is a real danger that you will go over the top in some way. Be careful that you don’t waste all the good work you have done over the past few weeks, especially where your cashflow situation is concerned.
leo,Even if you are the kind of Leo who does not like to show your emotions you won’t be able to stop yourself this weekend. Venus, planet of love, will overcome any inhibitions you may have and make it easy for you to say “I love you”. ,leo,No matter how talented a Leo you may be there is only so far you can go on your own. According to the planets you may have to join forces with someone you don’t much like on a personal level but it’s your professional relationship that matters.
leo,If a friend or family member says something critical about you today don’t think they are trying to put you down. More likely they are trying to make you aware of the mistakes you’ve been making so you won’t make them again in the future.
leo,Some kind of habit is holding you back and you are desperate to get rid of it. The only danger is that in getting rid of one bad habit you could so easily replace it with another that is ten times worse. Better the devil you know! ,leo,Keep your plans simple over the next 24 hours because it will be all too easy to get into a muddle and lose track of what you are supposed to be doing. Cosmic activity in the work area of your chart means you need to stay flexible. ,leo,There are so many things you want to do but you are human like everyone else and have to take your natural limits into consideration. Plan carefully and focus only on the things that really matter. Talk only to people who matter as well. ,leo,People in positions of power will say good things about you today but don’t think you can rest on your laurels. Yes, you have gone up in their estimation, but now you have reached that level you must work even harder to stay there.
leo,Once you make a decision about something you must stick with it. Don’t chop and change. The worst thing that can happen this weekend is that you keep moving your goals. Identify your number one aim and forget about everything else.
leo,Your overactive mind and your raging emotions have sapped your energy in recent weeks and it’s time you slowed down, and calmed down, a bit. If you don’t you run the risk of some sort of breakdown. Everything in moderation Leo, especially excess!,leo,No matter how many challenges you took on in recent weeks you came through them all unscathed, and still smiling. Over the next few days you will discover that your efforts were not in vain. The universe rewards those who strive.
leo,You will have to take other people’s opinions into account a lot more than is usually the case over the next few weeks. If you make a genuine effort to cooperate, rather than to compete as you usually do, there is no telling how far you can go.
leo,The Sun moves into your opposite sign today, which among other things means you will have to take other people’s needs and desires into consideration a bit more than you have done of late. Remember: when doing good things for others you benefit yourself as well.
leo,No matter how busy the past few weeks have been and no matter how desperately you need time to recover this is going to be an active day. Keep the momentum going, because once you slow down you will find it hard to speed up again. ,leo,You may find it difficult to think outside certain limits today and may reject perfectly good ideas simply because you don’t have the confidence to make something of them. That would be a shame. Try not to be your own worst enemy.
leo,Duty and pleasure will come together to make this a day when you make lots of progress and have lots of fun. The real change, however, is that your attitude is a lot more positive, especially where your work is concerned. Love what you do.
leo,You are eager to get moving and prove to the world you have what it takes. The only danger is that you will start off too fast and fall on your face, which is not the kind of impression you were hoping to make. Take your time and get it right.
leo,Something you hear today will cheer you up no end. It would appear that something you thought was a problem now turns out to have been mostly, if not all, in your mind. It’s not the first time and it won’t be the last!,leo,Honesty is essential, even if it means you have to say something that might hurt a loved one’s feelings. You have a reputation for calling it as you see it, which is why others come to you for advice. Give it to them straight.
leo,The things that happened in the past have nothing to do with what is happening today, so stop harking back to “the good old days” and find ways to make this day special and rewarding. Above all, accept people for who and what they are. ,leo,You may not be the most flexible of signs but there are times when even a Leo knows they must bend with the breeze. The winds of change are simply too strong for you to resist any longer. It’s time for a change – the bigger the better! ,leo,Some people enjoy making a drama out of a crisis but you don’t have to do likewise. No matter what happens, be it good, bad or indifferent, don’t overreact. Stay calm and stay in control of your emotions. Someone needs to keep their head. ,leo,You have so much talent but you don’t always make the most of it. Why is that? Maybe it is because you are not organized enough. Maybe it is because you spread yourself too thin. Maybe it’s time you broke a few bad habits!,leo,The planets warn you could put a friendship in jeopardy over the next few days if you push too hard. Don’t let your quest for perfection get in the way of more important things, such as love and respect. Is perfection really such a wonderful thing?,leo,Both in your private life and in your work others will go out of their way to do things for you over the next few days, and you must go out of your way to take advantage. Your instincts tell you it won’t always be as easy as this. ,leo,If you jump to conclusions today you could find out later on that you have jumped way too far. The planets warn that what you think you see and what is actually there may be two entirely different things, so keep your mind, and your options, open.
leo,The old always gives way to the new and if you keep that thought in mind today you will find it easier to let go of something that is holding you back. Something new will soon come along to fill the empty space in your life. ,leo,You are in a restless mood at the moment, unable to get comfortable in any one place. By why should that be a problem? Why should you stay in one location? Be more adventurous. Get out and about. See and be seen. Boredom is the one thing to be avoided. ,leo,This is an active and adventurous time for you and the closer you get to Monday’s new moon the more partnerships and relationships will come into play. Today and over the weekend be on the lookout for people whose big personalities mirror your own.
leo,The planets warn if you say too much, too loudly this weekend you could make an enemy of someone who should have been your friend – or at least stayed in a neutral corner. You don’t have to hold an opinion on everything Leo! ,leo,You will get some nice compliments over the next few days, which makes a change from the criticism you have been subjected to in recent weeks. Those who pat you on the back and tell you what a great human being you are mean every word of it. ,leo,Love is in the air today and if you make an effort to be positive about a relationship then what happens later in the week won’t hit you so hard. Think only good things about the people who mean most to you emotionally.
leo,You may be eager to show what you can do but you would be wise not to rush things. According to the planets there is a danger you will act too soon and only get half what you could have earned if you had waited a day or two. ,leo,Good news of one sort or another will lift your spirits but don’t start thinking that from here on in nothing can go wrong. Sometimes you can get carried away and take silly risks, so if someone tells you to watch your step maybe you should listen.
leo,You cannot please everyone you have to deal with, so decide what relationships are of importance to you and focus on them only. Don’t feel too bad about those you leave by the wayside – life does not have to always be fair.
leo,If you want to get things done today you will have to make others feel as if they are the center of your universe. Make them believe that life revolves around their existence, even if it doesn’t. Then they will do whatever you ask them to. ,leo,You are not the only one with a stubborn streak and you will find yourself up against an equally determined foe this weekend. If you both keep pushing something will sooner or later break, so use common sense and meet them halfway.
leo,The more you tell yourself that a task is going to be unpleasant the more likely it will be. If you approach it in a negative frame of mind then, inevitably, you won’t much enjoy it. Instead, try pretending you can’t wait to get started and see what happens.
leo,If someone you don’t always get along with makes an effort to be nice to you today you must make an effort to be nice to them in return. Just because you have different values does not mean you cannot be colleagues, or even friends. ,leo,You will learn something today that helps you make sense of what up until now has seemed largely irrational. For best results, be open to new possibilities and always believe that there is meaning behind everything that happens in the world. ,leo,Money worries seem to be on your mind a lot of late but there is no reason to panic. What is the worst that could actually happen? And if it did happen, would it really be so bad? Expect some positive financial news today or tomorrow. ,leo,As the Sun moves into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart today it is unlikely you will be satisfied with superficial answers. You want – no you demand – to know what is going on beneath the surface and behind the scenes. ,leo,All your instincts are screaming at you now not to take chances. If someone asks you to get involved in a money-making scheme you must thank them politely but turn them down. The more they talk it up the more likely it is to cost you.
leo,There can be no room for sentiment. Certain issues have to be dealt with and certain people have to be told there are no more free rides. Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good but now you must show the world your ruthless side.
leo,If you want to be free of money worries you must either earn more or spend less – it’s as simple as that. The full moon will point you in the right direction and it won’t be long before you have some cash in your pocket again. ,leo,The lingering effects of yesterday’s full moon means you won’t see eye-to-eye with someone over a business or financial matter. All you have to do is give the situation a bit more time and it will resolve itself to your benefit – and theirs too.
leo,According to the planets you will have to put up with people who, for whatever reason, don’t want to see you succeed. As a general rule the more others criticize the more certain you can be that you are moving in the right direction. ,leo,Don’t be too hard on people whose beliefs are so very different to your own. They are as entitled to their way of thinking as you are to yours, so be tolerant and try to work with them. If that’s not possible, just stay out of their way. ,leo,It may be frustrating that others are putting obstacles in your path but there is no point making a fuss because it won’t change a thing. Just carry on as you are and believe that you will reach your goal when the time is right – and you will.
leo,The planets warn this is not the right time to point out other people’s faults and failings, much as you might like to. Help partners, loved ones and colleagues feel good about themselves – and they will make a point of helping you too.
leo,There may be an element of risk in what you are planning to do but that won’t worry you in the slightest. On the contrary, it will add to the excitement and make success, when it comes, all the more enjoyable. Leos love to live on the edge.
leo,The news you get today may not exactly thrill you but neither is it as bad as you feared it would be, so look on the bright side. Remember, if you make a habit of seeing things in a negative light then they may become self-fulfilling.
leo,The lingering effects of yesterday’s full moon means you won’t see eye-to-eye with someone over a business or financial matter. All you have to do is give the situation a bit more time and it will resolve itself to your benefit – and theirs too.
leo,Yes, others are making life difficult for you but you are also making life difficult for yourself. What happens in the world outside your head is largely a reflection of what goes on inside your head, so be positive and believe in success.
leo,If you feel strongly about something then you must act on those feelings. No matter how unpopular it might make you if that little voice in your head says it is the right thing to do you should know better than to ignore it. Act now!,leo,Some of the changes taking place may not be to your liking but there is nothing you can do about them. You know that, sooner or later, everything works out for the best, almost as if there is a power guiding your life, so why worry?,leo,You may be making your mark on the world but for some reason there is still something missing, a space inside you that needs filling. What happens this weekend will remind you that there is more to existence than just getting and consuming.
leo,You will meet some interesting people over the next few days, people who look at the world through different eyes. They may seem strange to you but has it not occurred to you that from where they stand you may be the one who looks weird?,leo,You may be your usual energetic self but don’t expect others to be as motivated as you. Not everyone shares your passion and this could be one of those days when it is better to do things yourself rather than get others to help you.
leo,You may not be able to summon up a great deal of enthusiasm for what you have to do today but that’s okay. With the Sun, your ruler, opposing Jupiter you really don’t have to make too much of an effort. Get others to make it for you.
leo,Money matters have been worrying you a lot of late but what happens over the next 24 hours will ease your fears. If you stay calm and think logically there is no power on Earth that can harm you, at least not financially.
leo,What matters most to you in life? Is it money? Is it success? Is it creative fulfilment? Whatever the answer to that question might be you must make it central to what you are doing. Focus only on what makes you smile. ,leo,Any doubts you may have about a money matter will be swept aside over the next 24 hours. Cosmic activity in the wealth area of your chart suggests that you cannot fail, that if you take a risk it will pay off big time – so stop worrying and act. ,leo,You must practice what you preach today, and every day from now on. If you follow this advice you should manage to steer clear of the pitfalls that await those who say one thing but do another. Integrity is the most important thing you possess.
leo,There have been a lot of surprises in your life in recent weeks and you must expect a few more upheavals over the next three or four days. They won’t be so bad if you dread them less. It is the anticipation of change that causes fear. ,leo,There will be a number of dramatic changes in your life over the next few days. The ride may at times be bumpy but everything will come right in the end, so try not to worry. React to events as and when they arrive. You have nothing to fear.
leo,You are being pushed harder than ever before but that’s good because you need to be tested. The closer you come to what you thought were your limits the more you will realize that you are capable of much, much more. Be amazing. ,leo,Don’t try to force people to do your bidding today because even if you succeed it will create the kind of resentment that at some stage comes back at you. Coercion is always a poor option, especially when you are so good at persuasion. ,leo,What seems so amusing to you may not seem amusing to everyone, so don’t laugh too loud or too long or you could offend important people. Not everyone is as laid-back as you Leo – some people get touchy over the most ridiculous things. ,leo,You may think you need to make wholesale changes. You may think you need to rip everything up and start again from scratch. But it isn’t true and in fact would be a backward step. The good times will start in a matter of days, so be patient. ,leo,Put your worries behind you and smile. One of the best times of the year is about to begin, so forget about what happened yesterday because the only thing that matters now is what happens tomorrow and the day after that. Have fun!,leo,Travel is on the cards during the early part of the week, so be adventurous and go some place you have never been to before. The more daring your journey the more likely it is you will meet people who can transform your existence.
leo,The Sun is now moving through one of the most positive and cheerful areas of your chart, so be bright and be brave and don’t let other people’s negative vibes affect you in any way. Where disputes are concerned, just forgive and forget.
leo,If you feel the need to get away from your usual environment just pack a bag and hit the road. Others may say you are being irresponsible by running away but your chief responsibility is, was and always will be to yourself. Enjoy your vacation. ,leo,Try to avoid getting involved in too many things over the next few days because you have enough on your plate as it is. Quality is more important than quantity, so decide what it is that is of most importance to you and forget about the rest. ,leo,Why is a certain person so difficult to get close to? Whatever the reason – and there may be no reason at all – it is not worth getting worked up about. If they don’t want to know you that’s fine – there are plenty of others who do. ,leo,Whatever the source of your newfound enthusiasm may be you must keep it going. The more you get done over the next few days the more your stock will rise and the more opportunities for advancement will come your way. ,leo,By all means offer someone the benefits of your experience but don’t feel insulted if they turn you down. Just because you have been there and done it all does not mean other people have to follow your example. Let them make their own mistakes.
leo,You cannot change the past but you can change the future, simply by making the most of the opportunities you have in the present. All you need is the courage to start something new and the confidence to follow it through to the end.
leo,Fate will at some stage or other give you the chance to make something of your brilliant ideas, but that chance is unlikely to arrive for a week or so yet. Timing is everything, so for now just watch and listen while you refine your plans. ,leo,No way are you going to adopt a low profile today, not with so much positive cosmic activity in your fellow Fire sign of Aries. Besides, it’s just not in your nature – if the world isn’t noticing you then clearly you must be doing something wrong.
leo,You can’t seem to put a foot wrong at the moment, so by all means do what you like, say what you like and go where you like. It won’t last, of course. It never does. But while it does you are entitled to make the most of it. ,leo,The most important thing now is that you pace yourself sensibly, both in your work and in your social life. The planets warn if you push your mind and your body too hard over the next 48 hours you could do yourself a mischief.
leo,Mercury, planet of the mind, crosses the career angle of your chart this week and will in some way or other bring the recognition you feel you deserve. Remember, it’s not enough just to have a big idea – you need to do something big with it as well. ,leo,You will learn something to your advantage today. However, you will gain more in the long-term if you resist the urge to make unreasonable demands. Let friends and workmates see you can be reasoned with and they will meet you halfway.
leo,Don’t take what happens today too seriously. The Sun, your ruler, at odds with Pluto means others may think it is all doom and gloom but you know better. Whatever the situation, you can handle it quite easily if you stay calm.
leo,Try not to let a minor difference of opinion come between you and someone you love. It may seem to you, or to them, that there is no room for compromise but there is always room for compromise, especially when the moon is new. ,leo,Leave nothing to chance today, especially if you are on the move. The planets warn if you set off without a plan you will get lost very quickly. Other people can afford to be reckless but for you there is simply too much at stake. ,leo,Most of your worries are completely unnecessary and what occurs over the next few days will in some way or other convince you of that fact. Remember too that in the greater scheme of things material wealth is of very little importance.
leo,You want so much to be on the move. There are places you have yet to explore and with the Sun moving through one of the most dynamic areas of your chart you have no intention of playing safe and staying where you are. Go for it Leo!,leo,You will be in a talkative mood as the new week begins, but watch out you don’t give away too much information, especially about yourself. Knowledge is power and in the wrong hands can be dangerous. If you must talk, talk about other people.
leo,Today’s Venus-Mars link will inspire you to go after your heart’s desire, be it a person, an ambition or even a whole new way of life. Aim higher than you have ever aimed before, and don’t act surprised when your dream becomes a reality!,leo,You have so much energy at your disposal at the moment but what are you going to do with it all? Have two or three projects on the go but focus on just one of them at a time – that way you can keep yourself interested. ,leo,No matter what other people tell you today you must follow your instincts. According to the planets you are the only one who has a clear idea of what’s going on at the moment, so trust yourself. Your inner voice will guide you. ,leo,For some strange reason you are focusing too much on possible negative outcomes and you need to snap yourself out if it. This is still a hugely positive phase but it won’t last forever, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and act decisively. ,leo,Do you go on the offensive this weekend or do you resist the temptation to rock the boat in case it leads to further unpleasantness? Only you can decide which path to choose but it must be one or the other – you can’t have it both ways.
leo,You will be looking for ways to boost your income over the next few days and you won’t have to search far. If you get a hunch that something could be a money-spinner then go for it. Don’t let more timid types hold you back.
leo,You may be eager to show important people what you can do but don’t make your move too soon. You will get the chance to showcase your formidable talents later in the week, but for now just relax and let fate take its course.
leo,The Sun moves into the career area of your chart today, which is good news for your ambitions. If you feel that your talents are under-appreciated now is the time to do something about it. Change your job, change your style – change it all!,leo,Your energy and enthusiasm will be infectious and win over the doubters with ease. Before you know it everyone will want to be your friend. Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will boost your standing with important people.
leo,Your destiny is, was and always will be in your own hands. Too many people complain that they don’t get the breaks or that fate is unkind but that’s nonsense. Decide what it is that you want to accomplish, then do it – it’s that simple. ,leo,Never stop questioning what others tell you, even those who call themselves “experts”. They may have the qualifications and the fancy titles but you have something more important – it’s called common sense. You would be amazed how rare a thing that is.
leo,You appear to believe that something or someone you value is about to be taken away from you, but the planets indicate that is not going to happen. If anything you will get even more of what, or who, you desire over the next few days.
leo,Something you have been working on for weeks, months, maybe even years, is about to bear fruit and you will jump for joy when you see the results. Don’t let hangers-on steal any of your glory. This is your show and no one else’s.
leo,You feel a compulsion to get things done as quickly as possible but don’t be too hasty. Focus only on the things that are most likely to matter to your long-term social and professional success. Everything that is not essential should be left for another day. ,leo,A change of perspective is needed in your life and today’s cosmic influences will encourage you to upgrade your viewpoint. It may be a big step to take it but if you don’t take it you will always regret it. Life is supposed to be an adventure! ,leo,Something you have been working on for some time will move into a more productive phase today and you will take great delight in taunting those who said you had no chance of getting it right. A Leo always gets it right – eventually.
leo,Be aware of what is going on around you and be aware of how your actions can affect other people. This is a time of great opportunity but you must be on the ball mentally. Use your knowledge of human nature to get what you need.
leo,If there is someone you want to impress the best way to do it is to do more than is expected of you. If you go that bit further and really put yourself into your work over the next 24 hours you will get yourself noticed – and rewarded.
leo,A sudden attraction could take you by surprise over the next 48 hours, which is nice in a way, but it could also be dangerous if you allow it to develop into an infatuation. Don’t let a good-looking face be your downfall.
leo,Don’t be so suspicious Leo. Take what you are told on trust. If you are serious about moving up in the world you need to learn to give the people you work with the benefit of the doubt more often than not. You need them and they need you.
leo,The Sun in the career area of your chart will bring new opportunities at work. Whatever your ambitions happen to be you will get the chance to develop them further over the next few days. The universe wants to see you succeed.
leo,Today’s Sun-Jupiter link will in some way reward you for the efforts you have made, especially on the work front. It’s nice to be appreciated and it’s even nicer to be thought of as an expert, but don’t let it go to your head. ,leo,You may not feel particularly brave at the moment but you can of course pretend. The last thing you want now is for your rivals to see that you are having doubts. It’s not like you to be this negative and with luck it’s only temporary. ,leo,You will bring a project to a successful conclusion over the next few days, then immediately start on another one. Some people may say you are doing too much but that is envy speaking: they wish they had your drive and ambition! ,leo,As from today any doubts you have about the direction your career is heading will be removed. Once your anxiety has gone you will be able to focus on making the most of your opportunities and, above all, making a name for yourself.
leo,Others will try to talk you out of what you are planning but they won’t succeed. Only you know what it is you want from life and only you know what must be done to get it, so be brave and do what your soul says is right.
leo,An important decision about your job or about your money situation will need to be made over the next three or four days. Be brave and let those who fear change know that you will move ahead without them if needs be. And mean it.
leo,If you have been spending a bit too freely of late then what happens over the next few days will remind you how precarious your financial situation really is. But the planets will also point you in a new money-making direction, so it’s not all bad.
leo,You will get more out of life if you treat it as less of a battle. Fortunately, with Venus, planet of harmony, moving through the area of your chart that influences your reputation you will come across as more of a pussycat than a lion. ,leo,According to the planets you can expect some kind of windfall over the next few days but watch out because what you get from one source could easily be lost to another. Be on your guard at all times – in a laid-back, Leo sort of way. ,leo,You are not usually the forgiving sort but for some strange reason you are more willing than usual to overlook other people’s faults and failings. No doubt there is method in your madness – or have you had a personality transplant? ,leo,This may be an emotional time for you but don’t let your feelings get the better of you. Today’s Mercury-Pluto link urges you to use your head and don’t let emotions, be they your own or other people’s, cloud your vision in any way.
leo,Someone in a position of authority likes you and admires you and with power planet Pluto so strong in your chart you could soon be moving up on the work front. Opportunities like this come around all too rarely, so make the most of it.
leo,You know how easy it can be to lose your cool, so don’t be too hard on a friend or loved one who loses it emotionally – they have been going through a difficult time of late. Everything will be back to normal soon, so give it time. ,leo,You will go all out over the next few days to prove you are as good as the next man and better than most. Just make sure you prove it in acceptable ways. Despite what some people might say the ends do not justify the means.
leo,You will clash with someone at work today and it’s unlikely that either of you will be willing to give ground or admit that you were wrong. Competition can sometimes be creative but, on this occasion, it’s wasteful. You should be on the same side. ,leo,Stand up for what you believe in and let the world know that you won’t be intimidated. Just because you are out of step with the prevailing wisdom does not mean you are wrong. You may need to rescue others from their ignorance.
leo,Sometimes you can be a bit too impatient and the planets warn this could be one of those times. Yes, of course, you want to reach for the stars but common sense should tell you that you need to plan ahead and take it a step at a time.
leo,Most of the problems in your life have simple solutions, so stop making things difficult for yourself and look for the answers that are staring you in the face. If you still cannot see them ask someone you trust to point them out for you.
leo,The more others challenge your right to do as you please the more determined you will be to go your own way. However, there is one individual it might be wise to stay on good terms with. Find ways to please them without hurting yourself. ,leo,You need to get serious about that backlog of jobs that has been building up. You will get more out of the day if you focus on mundane tasks and put social activities on hold for a while. Besides, not even a Leo can party every night.
leo,Are you being a bit too suspicious for your own good? Probably. Having said which, the planets indicate it is better to be too careful than not careful enough. Not everyone is trying to cheat you, of course, but it only takes one bad apple.
leo,You know from long experience how quickly fortunes can change, so don’t get carried away by your current run of good luck. Yes, it will most likely continue, but make sure you have a fall-back plan – just in case it doesn’t.
leo,Resist the temptation to do anything outrageous over the next 24 hours. Your reputation is on a knife edge at the moment and people in positions of power are unlikely to look favorably on you if you go too far over the top. ,leo,If you make a snap decision about something over the next 24 hours you will most likely regret it for weeks, even months, to come. Take your time and make the right decision – better still, take your time and make no decision at all. ,leo,It’s unlikely you will get many straight answers when talking to family and friends today – for some reason they are determined to be evasive. They are also likely to be a bit touchy, so watch what you say – and don’t you dare poke fun at them! ,leo,Don’t turn down a social invitation that comes at you out of the blue. According to the planets you will make the acquaintance of someone who gets you thinking about life in new and more exciting ways. But that won’t happen if you stay at home. ,leo,Follow your instincts and don’t stop for even a second to question your motives. Once you have got things moving you must keep the momentum going – it will help you to smash through the obstacles that others have placed in your way.
leo,You will get the red carpet treatment today and you thoroughly deserve it. Most likely someone is trying to get in your good books so you will do them a favor of some kind, but you won’t mind in the slightest. You enjoy having your ego stroked. ,leo,Listen to what friends and colleagues have to tell you today, even if what they have to say is not what you were hoping to hear. If you ignore their warnings you won’t be able to blame anyone but yourself if you make a costly mistake. ,leo,You are not the sort who can stand idly by while others are suffering so, yes, you will get involved in a friend’s “issues” today. Do what you can to help them but don’t lose sight of the fact that, ultimately, only self-help can cure their ills.
leo,Partners and loved ones will be more assertive than usual today but this phase will last only a few hours, so even if they say or do things that rub you up the wrong way you must not overreact. Let it all go over your head.
leo,Don’t keep your feelings locked up inside Leo. Others will respond better towards you if they realize you are as vulnerable as they are. But don’t put on an act just to win their sympathy, because they are sure to see through it.
leo,Don’t keep your feelings locked up inside Leo. Others will respond better towards you if they realize you are as vulnerable as they are. But don’t put on an act just to win their sympathy, because they are sure to see through it. ,leo,You can quite easily turn what looks like a setback into a huge success this week, simply by staying calm and getting friends and family members to help you out. Ask them for their suggestions and don’t be afraid to admit that they know better than you.
leo,If you need inspiration today you are more likely to get it from other people than from listening to your own thoughts. Take note of what friends and work colleagues tell you, because chances are they see things more clearly than you.
leo,Your efforts, both at home and at work, will pay off eventually but it may take a while. Pluto, planet of transformation, is changing things behind the scenes and under the surface but you need to be patient. It won’t all happen overnight.
leo,You need a short, sharp shock to bring you back to your senses and what happens today will in some way or other help you to recognize that life does not have it in for you after all. Your attitude needs to be a lot more positive.
leo,Don’t worry too much if you are falling behind in your work schedule. The planets promise you will catch up eventually but for now you must not try too hard. Take the day as it comes and work only as and when you feel up to it. ,leo,It’s not like you to care who approves of what you are doing, so why are you trying so hard to win over partners and colleagues? A more open attitude is, of course, a good thing but don’t go too far and give others a say in your plans. ,leo,The more others say that nothing can go wrong and that you are on the road to fame and fortune, the more you should be on your guard, because success is never that easy. There is only one thing you can be sure about: that certainties do not exist!,leo,Let both loved ones and work colleagues know how much you appreciate their efforts and reward them lavishly the first chance that you get. Others will go out of their way to do things for you, because they know that you value their help. ,leo,Your routine needs shaking up a bit and what happens over the next few days will force you to make changes. That may not sound great but a smart individual like you should be able to see the new opportunities that change is now bringing.
leo,You will easily find fault with what other people do today. Provided your criticism is constructive you won’t cause too many upsets – in fact you may even do some good – but if you blame others for no good reason expect them to hit back at you hard.
leo,Do you get the feeling that you are banging your head against a brick wall? That some people are so thick-skinned that you will never get through to them? Welcome to the real world. Stop trying to persuade them and just do what you know to be right. ,leo,You won’t find it hard to get your way today but as far as possible you must try to convince others to go along with your plans rather than coerce them. Just because you have the power to command people does not mean you have to use it. ,leo,Something will happen today that brings out the compassionate side of your nature. And that’s good because you will gain more, financially and emotionally, if you take into account other people’s feelings. Maybe you’re not as insensitive as you seem.
leo,You may be in one of your impatient moods but if you act too fast this weekend you are likely to do more harm than good. Common sense should tell you that there is always time to think before taking action. Use your brain!,leo,You may get a bit emotional during the early part of the week but you must avoid going to extremes because it will do your ambitions no good at all. Take nothing too seriously and avoid people who tend to raise your blood pressure.
leo,Listen to your instincts and do as they tell you. It does not matter if the world and its wife is against you, if you genuinely believe that you know best then trust yourself and act decisively. Others will come round to your way of thinking.
leo,If there is someone you fell out with a while ago you must let them know today that you harbor no ill feelings toward them. You don’t have to say sorry for what went before, just tell them that they still mean a great deal to you. ,leo,It’s not like you to fear your own shadow, but you are certainly not so outgoing and optimistic now. The Sun in the most sensitive area of your chart means you need to get in touch with the inner you, the you that has doubts like everyone else. ,leo,The planets will in some way or other help you push your emotions to one side and do what you know has got to be done. Certain people may not thank you for it now but they will realize later on that it was for their own good. ,leo,The Sun remains in the most sensitive area of your chart for several weeks, which among other things means you need to be kind to yourself. Chances are you are not as robust, physically, mentally or emotionally, as you would like to believe.
leo,No matter how far behind you may be in your schedule you WILL catch up. Just keep plugging away and before you know it you will be on top of things again – and, looking back, wondering why you got so worked up about nothing.
leo,Major cosmic changes over the coming week will bring you to your senses and you will realize that reaching your goals, especially on the work front, is not going to be as easy as you imagined. Hard work is the key: always was and always will be.
leo,You have something to say, something you believe is of the utmost importance, but you are scared to open your mouth in case you upset some very important people. You’re right, you will, but since when did a Leo ever worry about that? ,leo,Your confidence seems a bit fragile at the moment, so steer clear of situations that are likely to be competitive in nature. You have nothing to prove, either to yourself or to other people – you were, are and always will be the best.
leo,Moderation is a must today. If you go too far you will find it difficult to stop. By all means have fun but be wary of people who try to incite you to go places and do things you don’t know much about. You are so easily misled. ,leo,The higher you climb the more likely it is you will hurt yourself if you fall, but since when has that kind of thing bothered you? By all means take risks today but, where possible, have a safety net waiting to catch you.
leo,You don’t mind how hard you have to work so long as the end result is worth it. But Pluto in the health area of your chart warns if you push yourself beyond your natural limits you may break down sooner than you expected. Go easy on yourself.
leo,With Saturn, planet of restriction, strong this weekend you may find it hard to put your thoughts into words. But in a way that’s good because some of them are only half formed. You need to get your head right before you start talking.
leo,You know what needs to be done but for some strange reason you are still holding back. Maybe it’s because you sense that the time for action is not here yet, that you should wait a little longer. Listen to your instincts, they know what is right. ,leo,You may look calm on the outside but on the inside you are a raging inferno and what happens over the next few days will bring your emotions to the boil. That’s good. It isn’t healthy to keep all those feelings bottled up inside.
leo,What you hear by way of gossip today is not at as bad as some people are trying to make out, so don’t overreact. Thoughts are powerful things and if you see what happens in a purely negative light it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. ,leo,It may seem as if certain matters are no longer under your control but if you think about it you will realize they never truly were. Nothing bad will come of having to follow rather than lead, so stop worrying and go with the flow.
leo,This is a good time to face up to aspects of your personality that you might not like to admit exist. We all have dark areas that we try to keep hidden but sometimes it is good to bring these negative thoughts and feelings into the light. ,leo,What you want more than anything now is peace and quiet but it’s unlikely that you will get it. Today’s Mercury-Jupiter link means there are issues that need to be resolved and it is your voice that will make the difference. Speak loudly.
leo,Others will counsel caution this weekend but you must not listen to them. According to some people it’s too dangerous even to venture beyond your front door! The world is not all doom and gloom: it is still a wonderful and magical place.
leo,Are you doing something useful with your life, something that makes a difference? If so, well done and keep at it. If not, you will get the chance to make your mark over the next few weeks. You have so much to offer the world.
leo,For some reason you fear the worst and because of that you seem incapable of making decisions. But there is no reason to panic. Ask yourself: what is the worst that could actually happen? And if it did happen, would it really be so bad?,leo,Rely more on charm than muscle to get what you want. By all means splash out on someone who means a lot to you emotionally, but don’t think you have to break the bank to impress them: a small personal gift will do nicely.
leo,You may not be in the most sociable of moods at the moment but that’s okay. A lot has happened in recent weeks and you need to find ways to make sense of it all. If you don’t feel like partying that’s okay – you’ll make up for it later. ,leo,It’s time to make a splash. It’s time to show the world what you can do. As Mercury joins Venus in your sign today you will be inspired to pursue excellence in everything you do. You’re good, very good – and you’re about to get even better.
leo,You have to tell loved ones what they need to hear as opposed to what they want to hear. Only a large dose of reality will bring their minds and egos back to Earth – and only you are strong enough to tell it like it is.
leo,Don’t let others distract you from what it is you think is important. You will in all probability have to put up with people who don’t want to see you succeed. The more they criticize the more you can sure you are on the right track! ,leo,The approaching full moon means your nerves will be on edge over the next two or three days, but nothing bad will happen, so don’t panic. As far as possible try not to upset your everyday routine. Everything is as it is supposed to be.
leo,It is essential that you start the week in the right frame of mind. At this time of year more than most you tend to fear the worst but a few days from now everything will be sweetness and light again – for Leos at least.
leo,It’s not often you let your feelings get on top of you but there will be times today when you have a hard time controlling yourself. Hopefully you will succeed because if you blow your top it may be you who ends up hurting the most.
leo,For quite some time someone you have dealings with has been trying to tell you that you mean more to them than just a friend or colleague. The question is, of course, what do they mean to you? Maybe it’s time to let them know. ,leo,It’s not like you to feel sorry for yourself but just lately it has been difficult to keep a smile on your face. No matter. By the weekend at the latest your mood will improve. You will look, feel and act like a completely new person. ,leo,The Sun’s move into your sign means your confidence levels will rise dramatically today and over the weekend. One of the most trying times of the year is now behind you and, in true Leo fashion, you will celebrate with abandon. Watch out world! ,leo,Chances are you will do something totally outrageous over the next 48 hours. The fallout could be major and it probably won’t do much for your reputation but will you worry about that? Of course not. You just want to have fun!,leo,Don’t you dare act as if you have no choice in what others expect of you. The fact is you always have a choice and to claim otherwise is to take the easy way out, to pass the buck. Don’t do it. Always take responsibility for yourself.
leo,If you want a job done well you must do it yourself. Don’t listen to what the so-called experts tell you because it is highly likely to be misleading. And don’t compromise your vision for anyone or anything – certainly not for money.
leo,With Venus, planet of love, moving through your sign this is the ideal time to remind those you care for how much they mean to you. Don’t worry if they do not respond with quite the same enthusiasm. Not everyone is as expressive as you.
leo,There are so many things you desire but don’t get crazy about it. The most important thing now is that you consolidate what you have got rather than go out and get even more. If you reach for too much you could end up losing everything. ,leo,This is your time of year and most things are going right for you now but not everyone is as fortunate as you, so if someone you know needs a helping hand offer it to them and don’t ask for anything in return. Spread a little joy. ,leo,There is a danger that you will go so far beyond what is acceptable today that even your friends start to wonder what has got into you. But your unpredictable ways will keep others on their toes – and less likely to take you for granted. ,leo,Everything will fall into place over the next few days, so stop worrying about whether you are doing the right thing and just act. Have the courage to make those changes you have been dreaming of – it won’t be long before they pay dividends.
leo,Everything will fall into place over the next few days, so stop worrying about whether you are doing the right thing and just act. Have the courage to make those changes you have been dreaming of – it won’t be long before they pay dividends.
leo,The Sun in your sign gives you the courage to take risks but they are more likely to pay off if you allow yourself to be guided by your inner voice. Deep down you know what must be done, so put your feelings aside and get to work. ,leo,Do something dramatic, something that makes the world sit up and take notice. The new moon in your sign will help you overcome any doubts you may be harboring that you have what it takes to succeed. You have what it takes and more.
leo,With Mars now moving through the most dynamic area of your chart you can and you must be more decisive. But that is not the same thing as foolhardy. Plan your moves carefully, then act with the full force of your personality and ambition. ,leo,It might be a good idea to keep certain thoughts and opinions to yourself today, especially if they are of the sort that have been known to start fights. If you cannot say something everyone can agree with it might be best to say nothing at all. ,leo,You seem to have strayed quite a way from your original creative or artistic intentions. Make it your aim over the next 24 hours to stand back from what you are working on and remind yourself what your long-term objectives are supposed to be.
leo,Start doing the things that will improve your financial position. For too long you have stood back and watched while others made the big bucks but now it is your turn to get a taste of the action. You deserve to be rich, so make it happen.
leo,There is a real possibility that you will come into money over the next few days. Don’t be suspicious if someone makes you a really great offer for no apparent reason – they are not trying to trick you, they are trying to help you.
leo,There are times when you have to accept there is no point pushing too hard, and if you are smart you will realize that this is one of them. Put your plans on hold, find something enjoyable to do and wait for the world to turn again.
leo,What happens today will convince you that something you have been working on these past few weeks is actually a waste of time. The good news is it will free you, mentally and physically, to pursue goals that are more to your liking.
leo,You may be self-confident by nature but not everyone shares your ability to rise about setbacks and turn them into triumphs. Make it your mission today to cheer up friends and family members who are feeling depressed – you’re good at that too.
leo,It may seem as if you are missing out on the action but it’s not true – and even if it is true it’s not a bad thing. Today’s cosmic activity is urging you to spend some time by yourself. Don’t worry, you will make up for it later.
leo,Others may think you do not deserve the rewards now coming your way but no one deserves them more. Don’t bother trying to justify your good fortune because others won’t want to hear about it. Just enjoy what the universe is giving you.
leo,Forget about any setbacks you may have suffered and start looking forward to a time when everything will go right for you again – it won’t be long in coming. Most importantly, don’t let rivals talk you down. You’re still the best.
leo,No matter how careful you are with words some people will still take them the wrong way, so you might as well speak up and not worry too much about the consequences. A week from now everything will be sweetness and light again. ,leo,A friend or work colleague will make a big deal of something that you think is of little or no importance. Strive to see the situation from their point of view but, if that proves impossible, agree to disagree and go your separate ways.
leo,The Sun in your sign is on excellent terms with changes planet Uranus, so by all means rock the boat a bit. But don’t take on too many tasks (or too many rivals) or you may not be able to give your best to what is truly important.
leo,You won’t hesitate to give your opinion today but the approaching full moon warns you could be stirring up a hornet’s nest. You may think you know the facts but there is something you have missed, something your rivals can use against you. ,leo,Yes, you have the right to say whatever you please but that does not mean there won’t be consequences. Today’s full moon in your opposite sign could make you a little too outspoken for your own good. Think before you speak Leo.
leo,The reason why other people are so demanding and expect so much of you is because you have set such high standards for yourself that they think you are capable of anything. Maybe you are but they have no right to demand it of you.
leo,For too long you have kept certain aims and ambitions to yourself and now you must let everyone know what it is you are planning to do. You will be surprised how much support and encouragement they give you. And you thought they would be angry!,leo,You need to let someone know that the past is over and done with and you don’t hold any grudges. They may need a bit of convincing but they will come round when they see that you are serious about working out your differences.
leo,Try taking a fresh approach to a money matter or business issue today. For too long you have allowed yourself to be overly influenced by what friends and family think you should be doing. Ignore what they say and follow your instincts.
leo,You have made a lot of sacrifices of late and will be asked to make another one over the next few days. However, before you do you must ask yourself what you will get out of helping other people. It’s not selfish, it’s just common sense.
leo,Today’s Mars-Saturn link makes it easy for you to take what you want but that does not mean there won’t be consequences. If someone questions your right to make up the rules as you go along give them a blast of your Leo charm.
leo,You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party. In fact this is a good day to find a quiet place where you can get your thoughts together. After all your recent efforts you may also need to give your aching body time to heal! ,leo,Your energy levels are high at the moment and the influence of Mars also gives you limitless self-confidence. But make sure you don’t go too far and say or do things that could turn others against you. Always focus your energy in positive directions.
leo,A wonderful Venus-Jupiter link will help you to believe that all things are possible, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you must do everything. You would be wise to limit your activities this weekend, and take nothing too seriously.
leo,Because Mercury is about to begin one of its retrograde phases it will be difficult to convince others that what you are planning is for the best. You may have to go it alone for a while but that’s okay. You really don’t need their approval.
leo,If you go out of your way to help someone today other people will go out of their way to help you later on when you are most in need of it. No matter what some of your rivals may say you are a nice guy at heart.
leo,If there is something you have been wanting to say but held back because you did not want to upset people now is the time to get it off your chest. Don’t say too much but don’t say too little either. Get the balance right so everyone is happy.
leo,Tomorrow’s solar eclipse in the financial area of your chart makes this the ideal time to look at what you own and what you earn. Don’t stick to tried and tested ways of making money, try something different, something that takes the world by surprise. ,leo,You may be doing well financially but don’t take too much for granted. Today’s eclipse could easily lull you into a false sense of security and lead to some kind of silly mistake. Make sure your cashflow situation remains under your control. ,leo,If you owe someone a favor this is the time to repay it. Don’t wait to be asked because that makes it look as if you have forgotten. You know what it is they need and you know you are in a position to deliver, so act now.
leo,Someone in a position of authority may have let you down but you are advised to let it go. According to the planets the worst possible thing you can do now is to start a feud, especially with someone who is more powerful than you.
leo,You will receive good news concerning your cashflow situation over the coming week but don’t celebrate until you actually have the extra money in your pocket. Even then you are advised not to commit yourself to any long-term spending plans. ,leo,Pace yourself carefully as the new week begins because your health is not as robust as you think it is. If you burn the candle at both ends now you will regret it later when your energy takes an unexpected dip at a most important moment.
leo,By all means go out and have fun but keep an eye on your money situation because you may not have as much to spare as you think you do. The Sun in Virgo will bring cashflow problems to a head if you spend too recklessly.
leo,There are times when even a Leo needs to be alone and this is one of them. If you are not in the mood for socializing then don’t try to force yourself. You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party each and every day. ,leo,Make sure you deal only in facts today because if you say something that your rivals can prove is wrong it will make you look bad and may harm your reputation. You don’t need to exaggerate to make yourself look big – you are big enough already. ,leo,Make time for social and travel activities over the next few days because what happens while you are on the move and having fun with friends will remind you that life is always worth living. Jupiter will show you how to smile again. ,leo,You have never been the kind of person to avoid difficult situations but the current cosmic picture warns in no uncertain fashion that if you get involved in a dispute of some kind it is you who will come off worst. No Leo, you are not indestructible.
leo,This is an excellent time to be a bit more assertive, especially if you are the kind of Leo who prefers to wait for other people to act before making your own move. Identify what it is you truly desire then go out and get it.
leo,There is money to be made over the next few days but if you take silly chances you could lose money too, so check and check again and then get someone you trust to check for you as well. You can never be too careful with cash.
leo,Someone will question your actions today and you won’t be too happy about it. However, the planets indicate there may be good reasons why you should take notice of what they say. Chances are they can see you are heading for a fall.
leo,You will have to pay more attention to what you own and earn over the next few days. If you are the kind of Leo who wastes money on trivial things you may find that you run short for a while. Either spend less or earn more. ,leo,There may be times today when you come dangerously close to panic. No matter how unsettling the events taking place around you may be you must stay in control, not least because others are depending on you. You’re their rock in a storm. ,leo,There is no point getting upset with people who are unable to understand why you are so angry. Not everyone is as quick off the mark as you, so make allowances. Also, don’t take what you hear personally – it’s unlikely to be aimed at you alone.
leo,What happens today and tomorrow will disrupt your plans and force you to think again about your long-term aims. On the home front, especially, you need to take stock of your commitments and also your attitude to partners and loved ones. ,leo,The more other people tell you that you need to act quickly the more certain you can be that they are thinking only of themselves. They are quite entitled to do so, of course, but not at your expense. Be patient and look after your cash.
leo,At some stage today you will look back over the past few weeks and realize just how much money you have spent. The good news is there are various assets you can sell off quite quickly to help you make up the shortfall in cash. ,leo,There is no point trying to predict what will happen today, or tomorrow, because there are so many directions that fate could take you. Fortunately, you are in the mood for some fun, so whatever happens you will find ways to make it special. ,leo,You may not agree with what a friend is proposing but as they appear to have made up their mind you might as well give them your full support. Will it end in tears? According to the planets it is more likely to end in smiles all round. ,leo,This is an extremely busy phase and there is a danger that you could do too much and burn yourself out. You cannot party until the early hours every night, nor should you want to. Treat your body and your mind with respect. ,leo,Why are you making an issue of something that is of only minor importance? There are so many things going right for you now that minor setbacks can safely be ignored. You are a larger-than-life Leo and you have bigger fish to fry.
leo,Everything seems to be going right for you now and long may it continue. To make the most of it try reminding yourself each and every day that life is a wonderful thing. It is only us imperfect people who sometimes make it look so awful.
leo,You will take on tasks and responsibilities over the next few days that at most other times you would seek to avoid. Don’t overdo it though. If you burn yourself out this week you will spend much of the following week trying to recover.
leo,If a friend or family member gives you a hard time about what you are doing, personally or professionally, say whatever you think it is they want to hear, then carry on regardless. Don’t let them intimidate you into changing your ways.
leo,Don’t waste time trying to impress people who don’t want to be impressed. Instead, focus your time and energy on people who appreciate you for who you are and what you bring to the party, especially your sparkling personality. You can’t please everyone.
leo,You may be tempted to interfere in someone else’s personal life today but the planets warn that nothing good will come of it, so resist the urge and keep your distance. The simple fact is you cannot help everyone, nor should you want to.
leo,Your mind is full of good ideas but you need to scale them down to the two or three that are genuinely worth pursuing. If you go after too many goals you run the risk of reaching none of them. Never stop thinking, but act wisely too.
leo,You have a lot to say for yourself at the moment and that’s good. Just make sure any claims you make can be backed up with facts because certain people don’t like it when you are this assertive and will be looking for excuses to silence you.
leo,Some people will oppose you no matter how logical and useful your ideas may be, so don’t get uptight about it. On the other hand, if their constant criticism is holding you back you are perfectly entitled to end your relationship right now. ,leo,If you are not happy with something in your life then you must pluck up the courage to change it. Don’t keep it going just because you think it is what others expect of you – the only thing that matters is what you expect of yourself.
leo,It may annoy you that certain people are taking their time and dragging their feet but there is no point losing your temper with them because they are incapable of changing their ways. It takes all sorts to make a world – unfortunately! ,leo,Put on a brave face, put failures behind you and, most of all, have fun. Before you know it you will have forgotten about your worries and woes, such as they are. There is still a lot of good in the world, and a lot of good people too. ,leo,If you compare yourself to others you will always be dissatisfied with your lot. Focus on your own skills and talents and ignore what everyone else might be doing. Your life has purpose and, believe it or not, you are doing better than most. ,leo,You may be an original thinker but sometimes your ideas can be way over the top. Stick to areas you know about and don’t make claims that cannot be backed up with facts. If you say or do something silly the critics will hammer you.
leo,This is potentially a great time for you, so put chores on hold and don’t let anyone burst the bubble of happiness that surrounds you. Your positive attitude will attract others to you – and you know how much you love to be admired! ,leo,Loved ones will be moody today and you in turn will be annoyed. Before the situation gets out of hand remind yourself that it takes all sorts to make a world and not even your nearest and dearest will always see things the same way as you.
leo,You may be eager to start something new but don’t get carried away. According to the planets your main task now is to inject some reality back into your thinking. You don’t have to give up on your dreams, just bring them back to earth. ,leo,The planets warn that friends and family members will tell you either what they think you want to hear or what they think will further their own interests in some way. In which case, take everything they say with a large pinch of salt. ,leo,You are advised not to do too much over the next few days. If a friend asks you to take on extra responsibilities you must turn them down flat. Your friendship will recover but your health may not if you push yourself too hard. ,leo,If there is something you need to say then speak up. The Sun remains in the communications area of your chart another week or so, making it easy for you to put your feelings into words. Say what you have to say and to hell with the consequences! ,leo,Flattery will get you everywhere this weekend but it works both ways: others will find it easy to flatter you too. This could be dangerous if you are the kind of Leo who needs reassurance, because others will tell you what they want you to hear.
leo,Everyone is entitled to their opinion and it is of the utmost importance that you recognize and accept that. Don’t get upset just because someone says something you disagree with. Stay calm, stick to the facts and argue your side of the story.
leo,It’s not like you to get depressed but recent events have brought you down a bit. Now you must get your act together and get back out there into the big, bad world where there is so much competition and strife. You love it really!,leo,Someone in a position of power will make you an offer today but you would be wise to turn it down. Not only will it take up a lot of time but it will mean dealing with people who, if you don’t hate them already, you soon will.
leo,There is a danger now that you will act as if you cannot possibly fail. Whatever it is you are working on you must have a solid plan. Make sure you know how you are going to get from where you are now to where you want to be.
leo,You desperately need to find a friend who can help take the strain of what you are carrying. You must not, even for one second, believe that no one cares about your plight. There is always someone out there you can turn to.
leo,Something will ruffle your feathers today and it’s likely you will retreat from the world for a while. But make sure it’s only a while. Loved ones are counting on you to make more of an effort, so get past your sulk and move on. ,leo,There may be times over the coming week when it seems as if the whole world is against you. But if you keep your emotions in check and look at everything that happens logically you will realize you are being touchy for no good reason.
leo,You know you have not been spending as much time as you should with family and relatives, so get your act together and give them your undivided attention. It will help smooth over the cracks that have appeared in recent weeks.
leo,Be careful who you confide in today. If you give too much away you could discover later on that a rival overheard what you were planning and stole your big idea. Be sociable by all means but keep the conversation light and simple.
leo,If you feel the need to prove yourself, either at home or at work, by all means take on new responsibilities, but be choosy too. If you are sensible you won’t take on too much too soon. Think quality rather than quantity. ,leo,You have been working quietly and patiently behind the scenes, waiting for the time when you can show what you can do. Now that time is here, so don’t wait to be invited – do something that makes the world sit up and take notice. ,leo,Creative activities will come easier to you today and over the weekend than they have done for quite some while. You may still struggle a bit in some areas, on the domestic front especially, but you will more than make up for it in others. ,leo,You may find it hard to admit you were wrong but you are advised to swallow your pride and accept you made a mistake. Next time try to be a bit less outrageous in the claims that you make. Or is that asking too much of a Leo?,leo,You will need to resist the urge to force others to do things this week. Yes, of course, you think you know what is best for them, and maybe you do, but that is not the point. Freedom to choose, and to make mistakes, is a must.
leo,The more you try to slow down the more work seems to pile up in front of you. Call a halt and let others know that enough is enough. You have many obligations but the most important one is to yourself, so learn to say ‘No’.
leo,You feel the need to prove yourself, to show those around you that you are a force to be reckoned with. That’s great, as far as it goes, but don’t go too far. Ambition is admirable but it is just one of life’s many roads to success.
leo,You don’t need to be modest about your achievements. You have accomplished a lot in a very short space of time and have every right to brag about it a little. Let the world know who you are and what you do – and how well you do it.
leo,You have nothing to fear and everything to look forward to, so why are you so determined to take a negative view of what is occurring? Remember, when you think bad thoughts you increase the chances of bad things coming about. ,leo,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart may be piling on the pressure but you are tough enough to take it. Anyone who thinks you will just roll over and play dead obviously does not know you very well. ,leo,You will be inspired this weekend. Your every thought, your every idea, will have a touch of genius about it. Others will praise you to the skies but don’t let the adulation go to your head. Ideas mean nothing unless you do something with them.
leo,The entry of Mars into your opposite sign on Wednesday will be cause for celebration but also cause for concern. You will certainly be more dynamic where affairs of the heart are concerned but you will be more argumentative too. An interesting week.
leo,What happens over the next few days will remind you that your home life and your family are the backbone of your existence, that if there are problems there you will never be happy in other areas. Put loved ones both first and last.
leo,This will be a very busy day and if you try to do everything you could end up in a state of collapse. Make a list of things that have to be done and stick with that to the exclusion of everything else. Make it essentials only Leo!,leo,The planets indicate that something is coming to a head and if you are not ready to change then the results could be painful. Your first task must to face up to certain aspects of your life that are not going as well as they should.
leo,You must act decisively, especially in one-to-one situations where the people you have to deal with could take advantage of you if you are not on top of your game. What you need to realize and remember is that everyone is a potential rival.
leo,What happens over the next few days may be a pain in the proverbials but it can also be a learning experience. You are going to have to overcome some major obstacles, which won’t be too hard if you keep a sense of perspective. ,leo,You need to pace yourself better when pursuing everyday activities, especially those that require a lot of physical energy. Sudden spurts of energy are probably not a good idea, so stay within your natural limits. Don’t exhaust yourself for no reason.
leo,State the truth as you see it and don’t say things merely to impress employers and others in positions of authority. Tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Chances are they will thank you for it one day. ,leo,Forgive yourself for any little sins you may have committed in recent weeks. No sign is perfect, not even Leo, so accept that mistakes have been made and that it is all part of the learning process, all part of the game we call Life.
leo,Although changes on the home front may not be what you were hoping for, in the long-term they will turn out to be exactly what you need. It may look as if everything is chaos now but give it time and you will see there is a pattern emerging.
leo,It will pay you to be cautious today, even though your outlook is generally excellent. Family matters, especially, need to be handled with care as partners and loved ones could be rather touchy over the next 24 hours. Have fun but be sensible too. ,leo,You’ve had enough ups and downs of late to last you until the end of the year and now you want nothing more than to take things easy for a while. A few days from now it will be all go again, so relax while you still can.
leo,Honesty is a must today, both at home and at work. You may be tempted to play down certain facts to stay in with loves ones and employers but your reputation for integrity will suffer, so call it as you see it and don’t worry about the consequences.
leo,If you are worrying that friends and work colleagues might not approve of what you are planning then simply don’t tell them. The fact is you are your own boss and you can do as you please and if others don’t like it that’s just too bad. ,leo,Do something creative, something that gets you noticed. Everyone was born with an ability of some kind and with the Sun moving into the most artistic area of your chart this week you must focus on your own special talent. Make it work and make it pay.
leo,You don’t have to do anything special today, just be yourself and the world will beat a path to your door. One of the most active times of the year is about to begin, so prepare yourself mentally and physically for the challenges to come.
leo,The Sun and Mercury in the sympathetic sign of Sagittarius will sharpen your mind, helping you to look ahead and see what is going to happen ahead of everyone else. But it will also sharpen your tongue. Try not to hurt anyone’s feelings!,leo,The planets warn in no uncertain fashion that you must avoid going to extremes. What happens today could easily tempt you to react excessively but later on, when you have calmed down, you are sure to regret it. The truth is it’s really no big deal. ,leo,You may be in a position to tell others what they must do but don’t abuse it. In a matter of days the tables will be turned and you will be the one who is being given orders. You don’t want anyone holding grudges, do you?,leo,Don’t waste time thinking of what might have been because the planets suggest if you get your act together you will do things in the future that more than make up for the things you should have done in the past. And the future starts now. ,leo,Find some positive things to say about friends and colleagues over the next 48 hours. The more you make others feel good about themselves the more likely it is they will do good things for you around the time of next Tuesday’s new moon. ,leo,There is nothing you cannot do now if you put your mind to it. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart gives you the confidence you need to embark on a brand new adventure. Time to make those outrageous dreams come true!,leo,Because tomorrow’s new moon falls in the most powerful area of your chart you will be dynamic in the extreme. Whatever your aims and ambitions may be now is the time to do something about them. Anything is possible if you want it enough.
leo,Put your worries behind you and take a few risks. A new moon in your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius will see to it that your successes will pay off big time while your failures, few as they are likely to be, don’t make a dent in your ego.
leo,Although the Sun in Sagittarius at this time of year makes you hugely dynamic you may find it difficult to get moving today. But don’t let it worry you if nothing much gets done because you will more than make up for it later on. ,leo,A lot of people are telling you a lot of different things and it’s beginning to make your head hurt. If you want to be safe you should ignore everything you hear, no matter where it comes from, and act only on what your inner voice tells you. ,leo,If there is someone on the work front whose support you need but who you have not been on good terms with of late, don’t worry, you will soon be friends again. Mercury’s influence will make it easy for you to heal rifts and end feuds. ,leo,The Sun in your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius makes this a good time for, among other things, love and creativity, and it will go from good to great over the next few days. Start making plans and make them big. You really can’t aim too high. ,leo,You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by being a bit more romantic. As Venus, planet of love, moves into the relationship area of your chart later in the week even the smallest show of affection could have significant benefits. ,leo,Although you seem confident, deep down you are worried that you are out of your depth and about to make a mess of something that everyone thinks you are good at. So what if you do? You’re a Leo – you’ll bluff your way out of trouble as always.
leo,The more someone tries to convince you that something is true the more you should be on your guard. Facts and figures can be interpreted in a number of ways, especially where business issues are concerned, so make sure you look beyond the obvious.
leo,You need to face up to the fact that you have only limited control over what is taking place in your environment. You will just have to accept that some situations are too big and too complex for even your forceful personality to make an impression on.
leo,You will face a number of challenges over the next few days and running away from them is not an option. According to the planets your life is in a bit of a rut at the moment and you must do something to get out of it.
leo,You will get most things you want today, that much is certain, but if you are smart you won’t try to get everything. The next few days are going to be hectic, so pace yourself sensibly and resist the urge to take everything to extremes.
leo,Someone in a position of authority will try to persuade you to change your point of view this weekend, and maybe your way of doing things too. Which only goes to show how poorly they know you. Leos never change – you are who you are.
leo,There is no need to change your plans just because you are having second thoughts about what you should be doing. Everyone doubts themselves occasionally, yes even a Leo, so sleep on it. Better still, wait until Wednesday’s full moon has passed.
leo,This is potentially one of the most enjoyable times of the year for you. Creatively and artistically the sky is the limit. Romantically, too, the coming week could be and should be special. Make the most of it while you can – you know it won’t last.
virgo,Spend some time alone as the new week begins so you can think deeply about what you are going to do between now and the end of the year. Give friends and relatives a miss or they will pester you with all sorts of problems.
virgo,Some things you can see from a long way away but others things you don’t see until you are right up in front of them. You’re not the only one to see something so important so late in the day, so don’t make a big deal of it.
virgo,There are times when you let the mask of self-control slip and let your emotions get the better of you and that will most likely happen today. If it does it may be to your benefit. Let others see you are not just practical but passionate too.
virgo,Family relationships are under favorable stars at the moment, so reach out to someone you love and let them know how you feel. Some say Virgos are cool and calculating, so now is your chance to prove them wrong.
virgo,What happens today, tomorrow and over the weekend may at times look chaotic but if you stand back and cross your eyes slightly you will see there is a pattern to it all. Never doubt that, bit by bit, your life is moving in the right direction. ,virgo,You have good reason to be annoyed with someone but because you are such an agreeable individual you may allow them to wriggle out of it just by saying the right words. That would be a mistake. Don’t forgive quite so easily.
virgo,For some reason you seem unable to bring yourself to say what you believe. Could it be because you know your opinions will upset other people and you just don’t want the hassle? What happened to your regard for the truth?,virgo,You seem to be plagued by a lot of irrational fears at the moment. According to the planets your worries are mainly if not entirely in your own mind, so focus on positive things and ignore whatever it is that makes you feel anxious. ,virgo,You will encounter hostility of some sort over the next 24 hours, most likely from someone who resents your ability to point out where they are going wrong. If it gets heated you would be wise to turn your back and walk away.
virgo,You are in a carefree mood at the moment and should make it your mission to cheer up friends and family members who do not share your happy-go-lucky outlook. You can’t change the world but you can make some people smile.
virgo,It would appear that your authority on the work front has slipped a bit of late and you need to find ways to remind people why they should do what you tell them. Be persuasive but don’t be rude. Leaders need followers who respect them.
virgo,If you have started on some kind of scheme then you must see it through to the end. Having come so far and invested so much time and energy you cannot give up on it now. Besides, it could work out better than you expected.
virgo,Saturn may be casting a cloud over money matters at the moment but you can still have fun. Besides, if you keep a tight hold of the purse strings now you will have more to spend over the holiday period and party season.
virgo,You have made a lot of sacrifices, both at home and at work, and over the next few days you will begin to see what it has earned you. New opportunities will come your way and new people will come into your life. Use them.
virgo,You may be dismayed to find that you are not quite so popular with employers and other important people over the next few days, but there is no need to worry. It’s just a passing phase and you will soon be flavor of the month again.
virgo,Your confidence is sky-high at the moment and because of that you are ready to risk almost anything to prove you are the best. Before the day is over even your critics will be singing your praises and willing you to succeed,virgo,Someone will be aggressive towards you today. What have you done to deserve being treated so harshly? Probably nothing but they may see it as getting their own back for something you said or did previously. Let it pass.
virgo,People will be demanding of you today and there may come a time when you realize you are being taken for a ride. The fact is they could have done most of these things for themselves if they wanted to. Make them wish they had.
virgo,If you feel the need to kiss and make up with a partner or relative now is the time. If you leave it much longer you may find that it isn’t so easy or, worse, that they have found the love they need with someone else. ,virgo,Check facts and figures today, especially those that a colleague says are okay and you don’t have to worry about. If you give them the green light to proceed now you may regret it later when what you’ve both missed costs you dear.
virgo,If you have confidence in your abilities then there is nothing that can stop you from reaching your goals. As the Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend anything is possible for you. Yes, really – anything.
virgo,Creatively and romantically this is one of the best times of the year for you, so decide what it is you want to achieve, then make it happen. Don’t listen to those who say you should not take risks, just do what feels right to you.
virgo,Try to be more trusting, especially when dealing with people whose support could be vital in the future. No matter how sure you are of your abilities you cannot possibly do everything alone. And a second opinion is rarely a bad thing.
virgo,This should be a productive day for you – you will get a lot done in a short space of time. Make the most of it because as you move into the new year you will find that not everything comes quite so easy. Be ruthless if you have to. ,virgo,You may not be thinking too clearly today but that will only be a problem if you are dealing with issues that are important. Steer clear of making any final decisions about things like your finances – they can wait until another day.
virgo,Play to your strengths and don’t let what others are doing affect you in any way. There are some things you do better than most and those are the things you should be focusing on now. You will soon be moving ahead in leaps and bounds.
virgo,With both the Sun and Venus traversing the most passionate area of your chart there is just no way you can keep your feelings to yourself. And why would you want to when your feelings are so positive? Spread the love around.
virgo,If ever there was a time to make a major effort that time is now, because it will pay off big time over the weeks and months to come. Cosmic activity in the most dynamic area of your chart urges you to be creative. Take a few chances!,virgo,If you are involved in anything of a creative or artistic nature it will go very well in the early days of the new year. It’s also a good time for affairs of the heart, so be creative in your love life too. No, it’s not true that Virgos are boring!,virgo,There is something that needs to be said and you are the one who should be saying it. The information will come out anyway later in the week, so you might as well be the one to break the news. It will put you at a distinct advantage.
virgo,A more assertive attitude is called for and with Mercury, your ruler, linked to power planet Pluto it shouldn’t be too hard. But don’t take risks with your money – no matter how assertive you are you will lose more than you gain. ,virgo,Today’s new moon takes place in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart, and with power planet Pluto in the mix as well you are sure to do something remarkable. Just make sure you do it for yourself and for loved ones, not strangers.
virgo,The sooner you stop worrying about your money situation the sooner it will sort itself out. That might sound too good to be true but the more you torment yourself about something the more power you give it. Fix your mind on something else.
virgo,Something that made no sense at all to you before will make perfect sense today. Most likely the thing itself has not changed but the way you look at it has. Next time, try listening to what friends and colleagues try to tell you.
virgo,You may have to get tough and lay down the law this weekend, but only because you have been too soft in the past and let people get away with things they should have been held responsible for. Next time, don’t let it go so far.
virgo,You will find that all sorts of people want to be nice to you over the next seven days. Does that make you suspicious? Don’t worry, the planets suggest their kindness is genuine, so if you need to ask favors, of anyone, now is the time.
virgo,Although some may find it hard to believe you are very much in touch with your emotions and that’s good because if you rely entirely on your rational mind today you could miss out on something. Let your heart rule your head.
virgo,Keep things simple today because the more complicated you allow your activities to get, the more likely it is you will get confused and make a mistake. Focus on essentials, and make sure they are easy to understand and put into effect. ,virgo,Do something different today, something that livens things up both at home and at work. Some people may think you have taken leave of your senses but they are just the sort of people who have been dragging you down. Ignore them.
virgo,It seems you are enamored more by things than you are by people at the moment. Nothing wrong with that as such but take care that your material desires don’t detract from your relationships. Ultimately, only love truly matters.
virgo,Take care you don’t get lulled into a false sense of security and end up making the kind of silly mistake you usually work so hard to avoid. It’s not like you to take things for granted, so check every last detail over the next 24 hours.
virgo,If you feel the need to clear the air then say what is on your mind. But be ready for the backlash, which won’t be long in coming. Some people, it seems, would rather you did not bring up subjects they feel uncomfortable with.
virgo,The Sun is on your side and your confidence is high, so do something special over the next few days. By this time next week it won’t be so easy to stand out, so give it your all, creatively and romantically, while you can.
virgo,The pace of life will pick up over the next few days, and that’s good. This is still one of the most creative and productive times of the year for you, so stop thinking about what you might accomplish and get out there and actually do it.
virgo,As tomorrow’s full moon cuts across one of the more outspoken areas of your chart you won’t be at your most tactful when dealing with people whose opinions you do not share. But why should you be when you are right and they are wrong?,virgo,The less you reveal about your plans the better. Keep your ideas to yourself and stay tight-lipped even if your best friends ask what you are up to. That applies just as much on the work front. The less others know, the better for you.
virgo,According to the planets you are too close to a project and need to step back a bit if you are to get a realistic view of how you are doing – and what you need to do next. Ask a trusted friend what they think as well – their view could be enlightening.
virgo,The Sun moves into the area of your chart that governs both your work and your wellbeing at the start of next week, so try not to exert yourself too much over the next 48 hours. You don’t HAVE to party each and every night you know!,virgo,Think very carefully before taking on new duties and responsibilities this coming week. It does not matter that you can do twice as much as others, and do it twice as well, you must not allow yourself to be taken advantage of.
virgo,Do whatever it takes to stay healthy and whole. If you don’t you will find yourself under increasing physical, mental and emotional pressure as your workload increases and your energy levels begin to decline. Put your wellbeing first – always.
virgo,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your work and your well-being is warning you not to push yourself too hard. Your energy levels may be a bit low at the moment, so pace yourself sensibly and cut back on your commitments.
virgo,You will get more done over the next 24 hours than you managed to get done in the past 24 days. But don’t think that means you have to work harder. On the contrary, you should cut back on your workload. Achieve more by doing less.
virgo,If you take what someone tells you at face value you will miss what really matters. Before you make any kind of decision, either in your personal life or at work, make sure you know all the facts – not just the ones others want you to know.
virgo,You tend to believe in only what you can see with your own eyes and touch with your own hands. But something will happen today that makes you wonder if there are other forces at work. Can you find a way to make them work for you?,virgo,If someone tells you there is something you cannot have this weekend you will go out of your way to get it. But has it not occurred to you that they may be hoping you will react this way? It could be you are being deliberately misled.
virgo,A part of you wants to do more but another part knows you are working too hard as it is. The only way to resolve this dilemma is to give up some things before taking on new tasks. Your time and energy are precious – and limited.
virgo,Why merely fantasize about being in an environment where family and financial worries play no part when, with a little bit of effort, you can make it happen? Stop thinking and start acting this week. The future is in your own hands.
virgo,You need to make a serious effort to sort out your problems with partners and loved ones. You may not want to make the first approach but if you do you won’t regret it. Show that you are ready and willing to talk things through.
virgo,Something you have been worrying about for weeks, maybe months, will resolve itself in your favor today thanks to the new moon. Your relief will be huge but there is a lesson to learn too: nothing is ever worth getting too worked up about.
virgo,Make the most of your current run of good fortune and make sure those you are closest to know how you feel about them. Chances are they know anyway but it never hurts to make sure. The words ” I love you” are never wasted.
virgo,To get what you want at home or at work you will have to give other people what they want in return. Don’t do anything that goes against your principles, because even if you come out on top as a result your guilt feelings will haunt you.
virgo,If you try to get out of something you have already agreed to today you won’t be the most popular Virgo in the neighborhood. That may not worry you much now but it could have repercussions later when you are dependent on other people.
virgo,You may want to push ahead with a project that is close to your heart but according to the planets a colleague is having doubts and you must deal with those doubts first if you want to make progress. Maybe they’re on to something.
virgo,Someone you have to deal with over the next 24 hours will talk non-stop without saying much of any great substance. Most likely, what they say will go in one ear and straight out the other — and you won’t have missed a thing. ,virgo,If a colleague makes an error and causes you problems today don’t make a big deal of it. Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even a Virgo – so let it pass and do what you can do make them feel better. You’ll feel good about yourself as well.
virgo,It’s important that you don’t let your anxieties get the better of you, especially where your health is concerned. You tend to fear the worst for no good reason at this time of year but eventually your fears will fade. Attitude is everything.
virgo,You have far too many things on the go at the moment, and you run the risk of losing control. You may not like to admit that you can’t do it all alone, but this would be a good time to get friends and family to help you out.
virgo,Someone who is down on their luck will come to you for assistance today and you won’t have the heart to turn them away. Hopefully you will also have the sense to see that their troubles are of their own making. Point that out to them.
virgo,It would be a mistake to take on any new tasks today — in fact, Saturn warns it could be disastrous. Far from adding to your workload you should be cutting back on your chores. Why make life tough when it doesn’t have to be? ,virgo,You may not see eye-to-eye with a certain individual but you can, if you make an effort, reach a compromise that satisfies you both. It’s quite possible to be allies in some areas and rivals in others, even though you may never be friends.
virgo,It’s important that you are honest about your feelings. If you keep them to yourself then your negative emotions may build up to the point where an outburst of some sort is more likely than not. Let loved ones know how you feel.
virgo,As today’s full moon occurs in the most sensitive area of your chart things you could not usually care less about will worry you. Provided you don’t act on those worries everything will be fine. Over the weekend you will realize it was all an illusion.
virgo,Major opportunities are coming your way, any one of which could make your fortune. All you have to do is decide which one to focus on, then give it your all. Advice from the stars: don’t reject an idea just because you did not think of it yourself.
virgo,Partners and colleagues and loved ones will go along with almost anything you suggest today, but only if you are polite and ask them what they think about it first. Don’t make life difficult for yourself when it should be easy.
virgo,You will feel an attraction for someone who is as different to you as chalk is to cheese and it could be the start of a beautiful friendship – or more. Opposites often go well together and the planets suggest yours could be the perfect match.
virgo,Someone who is jealous of your popularity will make life tough for you today, but they are unlikely to succeed. You are in one of those moods where negativity goes right over your head, and that will annoy them even more. Good. ,virgo,It may seem as if you are dancing to everyone’s tune but your own but why should that be a bad thing? Sometimes it’s nice to sit back and let others worry about where to go and what to do next. Life doesn’t have to be a drama.
virgo,Something dramatic will happen today and most likely you won’t be that impressed. However, if you keep your wits about you this is one surprise that can be turned in your favor. Someone else’s fall from grace could make things easier for you.
virgo,Partners and colleagues have the upper hand at the moment and if you are wise you will let them make whatever decisions they want to make. But you must also make sure that if things go wrong it won’t be you who takes the blame.
virgo,You are advised to take care this week as Mercury, your ruler, is still going through one of its difficult phases. Between now and Friday, when Mercury moves in your favor again, don’t take it for granted that what you are being told is true.
virgo,Because the approaching new moon falls in the partnership sector of your chart you will find it easier to identify with and sympathize with other people’s worries. Help them if you can but don’t let their worries rub off on you.
virgo,Patience is a must today because if you act impulsively you are sure to lose out. You may be frustrated that something you are working on is not progressing as smoothly or as quickly as you would like but, seriously, what’s the rush?,virgo,You will find you are a lot more emotional than usual today. But that could actually work in your favor, especially if you have not been too open about your feelings of late. Every now and then it’s good to let it all come out.
virgo,As from today you should find it easier to organize your daily routine and either get rid of or delegate jobs that take up a great deal of your time for very little in the way of rewards. Think clearly, take control and be decisive.
virgo,Put yourself in someone else’s hands and trust their judgment. You may like to be in control of every aspect of your own existence but just this once you are advised to let go and let others lead and guide you. The results will delight you.
virgo,Don’t plan anything too serious for the next few days because this is a time for fun. If work colleagues and employers expect you to knuckle down and get things done they are going to be disappointed. Find ways to make them laugh too.
virgo,You may have to get tough with someone who has let you down but make sure you don’t let your anger take over because if you go too far you will lose your credibility. Virgos are supposed to be rational, not emotional.
virgo,Try not to waste time and energy on people who are clearly not worth the effort. Certain individuals will always be ungrateful no matter what you do – it’s in their nature – so identify them and avoid them, as far as you can.
virgo,Try to remember that it’s quality, not quantity, that counts. If you keep that point in mind today everyone will praise you for a job well done. If, however, you try to do too much you will end up pleasing no one, not even yourself.
virgo,You want to get things done and you want to get them done now, but because not everyone is as motivated or dynamic as you it may take some effort to get others to help you. No, you can’t go it alone – there is too much to do.
virgo,It is possible to be too generous and at some point today you will realize that your sympathy for someone was misplaced. There is no point getting angry about it, with them or with yourself, but try not to make the same mistake twice.
virgo,Something you do for a friend or work colleague will have far-reaching consequences, both for them and for you. A small sacrifice now could lead to big gains later on, so put your own needs on hold and put yourself at their service.
virgo,Don’t make any hard and fast plans for the next few days because cosmic changes around the time the Sun links to Saturn on the 13th will disrupt things hugely. That might sound ominous but chances are you will enjoy what occurs.
virgo,No matter what problems or difficulties you face over the next few days you will be able to deal with them all. You will, of course, get them out of the way quicker if you ask friends and family to help you out. So ask!,virgo,You will be in a serious mood today as Mercury, your ruler, squares up to Saturn. A number of things you once believed in will be called into question and so-called “facts” will no longer stand up to scrutiny. It’s time to get real.
virgo,A positive outlook in the face of adversity is essential. Because Virgo is a sign that gets caught up in details you have a tendency to think it’s the end of the world when little things go wrong. It isn’t – and most likely never will be!,virgo,Today’s Sun-Saturn link will encourage you to get serious about your prospects, especially in your career. Map out how you see your ambitions unfolding over the coming six months – and who you can rely on for support. Then make it happen.
virgo,You will be tempted to take some kind of risk today and because your ruler Mercury is nicely linked to Mars, planet of action and energy, you may well pull it off. Don’t forget though that long-term success takes hard work and dedication.
virgo,The full moon in your sign this weekend means you need to pay more attention to what partners and loved ones are up to. Have you been neglecting them of late? If so, make an effort to spend some quality time with them now.
virgo,You will be easily irritated this week, especially by people who cannot make up their minds about things you decide on in an instant. Be reasonable. Not everyone is as quick off the mark as you, nor is there any reason why they should be.
virgo,You won’t see eye-to-eye with someone today but that doesn’t matter – in fact it’s good. The world would be a boring place if, as utopian sorts might like, everyone got along all the time. Conflict can be fun, especially for the winners.
virgo,No matter how irritating certain people may be you must not let them get under your skin. On the work front, especially, you need to relax and let life happen. The more you try to force things the more others will try to annoy you.
virgo,If your sixth sense tells you that something is not quite right you must listen to it and refrain from doing anything that might lead you down the wrong path. That applies to all areas but especially to matters related to your long-term finances.
virgo,The Sun’s change of signs means you need to change too. Most importantly, it means you need to get rid of ideas you are comfortable with but which in some ways are holding you back. Move with the times. Failing that, just move!,virgo,It’s easy to find fault with other people, especially for someone as pernickety as you, but is your own life blameless? If you get too critical today you may find that someone turns the tables by highlighting your own failures. Embarrassing!,virgo,Make a point of hearing both sides of a story before reaching a decision about who you are going to support. Just because someone knows how to talk louder and faster does not mean they have the better arguments. Listen to everyone.
virgo,The more others demand to know what you’ve been up to the more mysterious you should be. Not because you have anything to hide but because by keeping them guessing they will think you’re more interesting than you really are! ,virgo,If you let fear get the better of you today you could miss out on something that would have been a lot of fun – and might even have made you a lot of money. You really have nothing to be anxious about, so take a few risks.
virgo,Something will go out of your life over the next few days and you must not try to cling on to it. The planets suggest that something even better will appear to take its place around the time of next weekend’s new moon.
virgo,Joint plans are less likely to go wrong today if you keep any doubts you have to yourself. Yes, it’s quite likely you can see a better way of doing things but, having agreed to take part in a venture, you must be positive about it.
virgo,You will find it easy to express yourself today and, more importantly, others will find it easy to understand you. If you are involved in a creative pursuit of some kind this is also a good time to impress important people with your skills.
virgo,You are in a rebellious mood at the moment and may well do something that shocks both your friends and your enemies. That’s good. Too many people have been taking you for granted of late. Do something that shakes them up a bit.
virgo,By all means give someone the benefit of the doubt but if your sixth sense warns you are being cheated maybe you should be a bit more cautious. It could be you have been too generous. Sadly, not everyone can be trusted.
virgo,If someone makes you a financial offer on Monday or Tuesday you may be tempted to take it but the planets indicate that an even better deal will be available later in the week, so bide your time. Why rush? You’re not desperate. ,virgo,You are advised to hold fire and not be too pushy over the next 24 hours. No matter how ambitious a Virgo you may be there is only so much you can do in any one day, so conserve your energy for when you most need it.
virgo,Others will be generous with you if you are generous with them. Let friends and colleagues know you are willing to work alongside them not just for your benefit but for the benefit of everyone. Teamwork is essential now, in all areas.
virgo,By all means enjoy life today but try not to be so free and easy with your cash. Spending money may not be a problem for you now but it will be later when there is something you want to buy and you cannot afford it.
virgo,If there is someone you would like to know better, most likely with a view to romance, let them see you are interested. If you make the right sort of move now it could be the start of a beautiful friendship – and maybe much more!,virgo,A relationship that has caused you a few sleepless nights will start to improve as from the weekend but don’t think that means you no longer have to work at it. According to the planets this may be the last chance you’ll get.
virgo,You are highly motivated at the moment and that can only be good. Attack difficult tasks with energy and enthusiasm and before you know it your workload will be behind you – then you’ll have the rest of the weekend to have fun.
virgo,The more you want to do things one way the more others want to do them another way and the potential for conflict is clear. However, on this occasion it may be more beneficial to give in, at least where family and money matters are concerned.
virgo,If you need financial assistance now is a good time to ask. Friends and family will do what they can to help you out of a tricky situation but they will also want to be sure you won’t go and get yourself into a similar situation again.
virgo,Actions speak louder than words and because you have something to prove you won’t hesitate to make things happen over the next 24 hours. Not everyone will be happy that you have disturbed the status quo but for you it will be worth it.
virgo,If someone is critical of your work today don’t let it get to you. Either they don’t know what they are talking about or they are trying to make a small flaw or failing look much bigger than it actually is. Just ignore them.
virgo,You seem to have a phobia about something that at most other times would not worry you in the slightest. This sense of fear and uncertainty may continue for a few days yet – but come the start of next week you’ll be all smiles again.
virgo,You seem to be in everyone’s good books at the moment, which for some crazy reason makes you suspicious. The simple fact is some people like you for who you are, so stop being negative and start enjoying the attention.
virgo,Not everyone is as honest as you, so be on your guard when people whose motives you are unsure about make promises you have no way of knowing if they can keep. Before you give them what they desire make sure they pay you first!,virgo,If something you are working on does not seem to be going too well don’t lose heart, and certainly don’t give up on it. A week from now the cosmic picture will change and suddenly it will start going right for you. Be patient, and persistent.
virgo,The message of the stars this week is that you must not start anything you may not be able to finish. Likewise, don’t make promises you may not be able to keep. If you don’t aim so high you’ll look good when you do more.
virgo,Be extra careful when dealing with money matters and business issues. Anything that sounds too good to be true most likely is, so don’t let your enthusiasm get the better of you and check everything you hear, even from trusted sources.
virgo,This is still not a good time for making decisions to do with money or property or investments. If you give yesterday’s eclipse a few days to wane you may find that what you thought was a good deal was in fact nothing of the sort.
virgo,If you promised to do something for a friend and now find you’ve had a change of heart, well too bad! If you let even one person down today your reputation for trustworthiness will quickly head south. Do what you said you would.
virgo,Make life easier for yourself today by taking nothing too seriously. Don’t focus on winning, focus on having a good time and, in the process, learning what you can about other people. You may find they are not so very different to you.
virgo,The restrictions that have held you back in recent weeks will disappear over the next 48 hours but that is not an invitation to go on a spree. Don’t waste your time, energy or money on things that matter little in the greater scheme of things.
virgo,Your confidence may be on a high now but don’t get carried away. The Sun in Taurus puts a rosy glow on things but other influences warn there may be things going on behind the scenes that could upset your plans. Proceed with caution.
virgo,There is a chance you will fall out with someone in a position of authority today, and the results could be messy. If it’s not possible to stay out of their way at least promise yourself that you won’t react when they say something stupid.
virgo,It’s not often a Virgo is easily parted from their cash but the current cosmic set-up warns that’s a real possibility today. Never doubt there are plenty of people out there who would like to get rich at your expense. Don’t let it happen.
virgo,This is one of the best times of the year for you and it will get even better over the next few days as Mercury, your ruler, opens your mind to new possibilities. You may have to travel far to find happiness but you’ll do whatever it takes.
virgo,You want to take a trip but have no valid reason for traveling. So what? Cosmic activity in the most adventurous area of your chart urges you to let your impulses guide you. You can’t help but end up some place that’s fun.
virgo,If you make an effort to reach out to those you love this will be a thoroughly enjoyable day. Some people may be of the opinion that you lack the human touch but obviously they don’t know you too well. Prove them wrong.
virgo,You will be thinking deeply about your life this weekend and the conclusions you reach will have a profound effect on the way you look at and deal with the world. Something else you will realize: we don’t ever truly stop learning.
virgo,It seems you are on a winning streak at the moment and it will get even better over the next few days. Whatever you put your mind to now will work out perfectly, so imagine great things – and let your big heart guide you.
virgo,You may not be entirely convinced that what you are about to do is going to succeed but you have promised others that you will try and you can’t let them down. If it does go wrong at least they are unlikely to ask you again!,virgo,Voices may be raised over the next 24 hours but if you adopt the right attitude it will pass by and leave you unscathed. What you need most right now is a sense of humor, the kind that can laugh at life’s silly little ups and downs.
virgo,Accusations of one sort or another will fly thick and fast today but none of the mud that is thrown will stick to you. It’s not that you are whiter-than-white – you just know how to disguise what you do better than most people!,virgo,The planets are very much in your favor at the moment and no doubt you fear nothing, but you still need to be careful. Don’t push your luck and don’t push yourself beyond your natural limits, no matter what the potential rewards might be.
virgo,You may be practical by nature but you are allowed to dream too and the planets suggest that one particular dream is very close to coming true. Go all out today and over the weekend to push past any remaining obstructions.
virgo,If there is something you need to say that you know friends and family members won’t be happy with then say it now and get it over with. You may be a nice guy by nature but sometimes even a Virgo has to play hardball.
virgo,If you have done something wrong and know you will get found out sooner or later then maybe you should own up straight away. Whatever your transgression maybe others will want to forgive you, so be repentant and make it easy for them.
virgo,A family matter you thought had been resolved will rear its ugly head again today and this time you must make sure it is settled. You may not like having to lay down the law but if you don’t the issue will continue to nag at you.
virgo,It’s time to get working on something of a creative nature that you have been thinking about for quite some time. It will take a great deal of effort, both physical and mental, but it will be a success – that’s a promise from the stars!,virgo,You won’t lack for opportunities today but don’t just throw yourself at the first one that comes along. Identify what it is you most want to accomplish and wait for the right offer or opening – the universe will send it to you very soon.
virgo,You have absolutely nothing to worry about but for some strange reason you have this feeling of impending disaster. Ignore it. Most likely it is just your mind playing tricks on you – and even if it isn’t, what happens will be no big deal.
virgo,Don’t change anything for the sake of it today because you will only have to change it back again later. It might be better to stick with what you know about, even if it is not what you want. Wait and see what the weekend brings.
virgo,Without doubt this is one of the best times of the year for you but don’t let your joy for life lead you to do things that might not be good for you in the long-term. Know your limits, physically, mentally and emotionally, and stay within them.
virgo,You will hear something that you can, if you wish, turn to your advantage, but is it the right thing to do? If you are told something in confidence or overhear a secret that was not meant for your ears it may not be right to make use of it.
virgo,Don’t try to keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself today because loved ones and colleagues will be able to read on your face what it is you are hiding. You must be totally honest about what is going on in your head and your heart.
virgo,You will find that a number of questions you have been asking over the past few weeks will answer themselves over the next 48 hours. Whether or not the answers are to your liking at least you will know what it all means.
virgo,Don’t let anyone convince you that your ideas are of no value and that your beliefs are wrong. Today’s full moon will muddy waters and make you wonder what is fact and what is fiction but you can always trust your inner voice.
virgo,Make it a priority to kiss and make up with someone you fell out with a while back. Most likely you are genuinely sorry you got angry about something that, with hindsight, looks absurdly trivial. You’ll both get over it.
virgo,This is an important time for you, especially if you have big ambitions. Don’t worry if you are still not decided what you should be aiming for in life because the next few days will narrow down your options and make it easier to choose.
virgo,You will be somewhat outspoken over the next 48 hours, which is fine, but don’t get carried away and start bringing up issues that others thought had been dealt with weeks, months, even years ago. It’s time you got over them.
virgo,The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart this week will bring new opportunities and make you aware of possibilities you may not have noticed until now. Before you know it you’ll be on your way to the top. It’s where you belong.
virgo,This will be a busy day and if you are not careful you could tire yourself out rushing here, there and everywhere. Keep your workload to a minimum and keep your aims in perspective. What will it all mean one hundred years from now?,virgo,It may seem as if a dream of some kind is not going to come true but more likely the planets are making you wait a bit so that when the things you desire eventually come your way you will appreciate them more. That’s not so bad.
virgo,You have been waiting in the shadows long enough. Now is the hour when you step out into the world and claim your spot center stage. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart will encourage you to be more ambitious.
virgo,If you want to make an impression on people in positions of power now is the time to make your move. The Sun in the career area of your chart urges you to do something drastic, something that makes others sit up and take notice.
virgo,Over the next few days you will get the chance to put some of your big ideas to the test. One of those ideas could turn your life around and send you off in a direction you never even considered before. Don’t be afraid to take risks.
virgo,You will throw caution to the wind over the next 48 hours and that’s a good thing. Success to one degree or another is guaranteed and the more you put yourself out there the more you will enjoy yourself. What’s not to like!,virgo,Think seriously about your ambitions. Would you like to change them in some way? If so, now is the time to make your plans and let others know that you are serious about changing your life. You may be surprised how supportive they are.
virgo,People in positions of power will make demands on you over the next few days that you may find hard to meet. The most important thing is that you stay calm and keep your mind free of fear. Always think logically and always act quickly.
virgo,If you are in any way dissatisfied with your lot, now is the time to do something about it. The approaching new moon means that changes are good for you, especially those to do with your career. You will soon be moving up in the world.
virgo,A new moon in the career area of your chart will give you the courage and confidence you need to make necessary changes on the work front. Remember: it’s your life, it’s your career and it’s your choice as to what you do with them both.
virgo,Money may be important to you but it must not be allowed to come ahead of more important things such as love and laughter. Don’t think about what you own and earn, think about what motivates you and makes you smile.
virgo,You have built up so much momentum in recent weeks that you will be moving onward and upward for some time yet. Having said that, you know you cannot keep up this pace forever, so at least start thinking about slowing down.
virgo,With the Sun on excellent terms with Mars this weekend there is precious little you cannot achieve once you set your mind to it. Early next week the omens won’t be quite so good, so take advantage of any and all opportunities now.
virgo,Whatever you do over the next few days some people are sure to criticize you for it, so close your ears and do it anyway. Fortunately, you rather enjoy doing things you know will cause waves – it’s one of your main pleasures in life!,virgo,Keep your plans to yourself today. The less others know about what you are up to the better. You don’t have to be dishonest about it but you do have to realize that there are people out there who don’t want to see you succeed.
virgo,You have big ambitions and you have what it takes to reach the top. However, the planets warn if you act in haste you will repent at your leisure, so don’t be too eager to follow your dream – it could turn into a nightmare.
virgo,You are determined to do something different, something out of the ordinary, and that’s great. But you need to get started on it immediately because come the weekend, when Mercury turns retrograde, all sorts of obstacles will be placed in your way.
virgo,It may feel as if you are under the thumb both at home and at work and no doubt it’s true, but there is no point getting stressed about it. Sit tight and wait for the cosmic outlook to change, which it should do any day now.
virgo,You will have to fight for your rights today, both at home and at work. If you don’t, if you let others eat away at your privileges, you may have none left by the time of the full moon on the 13th. Give as good as you get!,virgo,It may seem as if so much is going wrong in the world but in the greater scheme of things most of it doesn’t matter. There is a plan behind it all and if you look for it today you may catch a glimpse of the bigger picture.
virgo,You need to prepare yourself mentally for some kind of setback. The good news is that in the long-term you will be glad you were forced to cut back on your objectives, though for now you’ll be annoyed you can’t have things all your own way. ,virgo,With Neptune beginning one of its retrograde phases in your opposite sign today you may be a bit confused about what others expect of you. That’s okay, because chances are they don’t know themselves. Do what feels right to you, nothing more.
virgo,Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn makes you feel you are to blame for other people’s problems but there is no logical reason why that should be so. The fact is the more they try to hold you responsible the more likely it is to be their fault!,virgo,Someone you have not seen for a while will come back into your life over the next 24 hours. You may still be a bit sore that they walked out on you without reason or explanation but let it pass. You were made to be together.
virgo,If you want to get the most from the day you are advised to focus your energy in a single direction and put less important matters on the back burner for a while. If you crave success – and you do – you have got to be ruthless.
virgo,Because today’s full moon cuts across such a powerful angle of your chart you must be ready for those around you to overreact in some way. On the home front, especially, there will be times when logic goes right out the window.
virgo,Mars in the money area of your chart will inspire you to make more of your talents over the days and weeks to come. You may be easygoing by nature but no way should you ever accept less than you are worth, financially at least.
virgo,If you try to wriggle out of a commitment this week you will do your reputation a great deal of harm. If you promised to do something for a relative or a friend and now find that you don’t want to do it, well, that’s just too bad.
virgo,When the Sun moves into one of the more positive areas of your chart next weekend you can speak up and let powerful people know why you oppose them. For now though you are advised to bite your tongue and let others do the talking.
virgo,If you see that a friend or relative needs help then step up to the plate and do what you can for them. Some people find it hard to ask for assistance – they think it’s a sign of weakness. Take the pressure off them by making the first move.
virgo,Socially and romantically this is one of the best times of the year for you, so put your chores on hold and don’t let anyone burst the bubble of optimism and happiness that surrounds you. Your positive attitude will attract like-minded people.
virgo,A relationship will come under pressure today and if you say or do the wrong thing it may even come to an end. Tomorrow, inevitably, you will regret having been so brutally outspoken but chances are it needed to happen.
virgo,By all means plan something new but don’t start on it yet. When the Sun changes signs tomorrow it’s quite likely you will become aware of a better way to reach your aims and fulfill your desires. There’s no rush, so take your time.
virgo,There are certain beliefs and ideals you will never give up on or compromise and that’s good. However, circumstances always change and sometimes you need to change with them. Allow yourself to bend a bit this weekend, though not too much.
virgo,Be on your guard as the new week begins because the planets warn not everyone you think is a friend can be trusted. Don’t take chances and don’t give anyone the authority to make decisions for you – that’s asking for trouble.
virgo,Venus, planet of harmony, crosses the career angle of your chart today, so you should find it a whole lot easier to get your way with people in positions of power. By the end of the day they will be eating out of your hand.
virgo,You will get several interesting offers over the next few days. How will you know which of them are right for you? Just listen to your inner voice and follow what it tells you to do. You already know all the important answers.
virgo,There is nothing wrong with having power but if you’ve got it you must make sure you use it in the right way. Bear that thought in mind today. Don’t use power or position to take what you are not really entitled to.
virgo,You will get the proverbial offer you cannot refuse today but if you are smart that is exactly what you will do. The planets indicate that there will be better offers coming your way before the end of the week – and lots of them.
virgo,Today’s new moon suggests that you can, if you wish, take a leadership role in group activities. Others will follow you willingly if you are in turn willing to take more responsibility. Lead from the front – it’s where you should be.
virgo,The most important thing this weekend is that you stay calm, no matter what happens. Also, if you can learn to take yourself a bit less seriously you won’t get so angry with people and your successes will outnumber your failures.
virgo,Find a quiet place away from the chaos of everyday life and let your inner voice speak to you. Stop searching so hard for answers in the world out there and turn your attention inward for a change. Your higher self knows what you need.
virgo,The planets indicate that people in authority will look on you favorably over the next few days, so keep doing what you are doing and make sure you do it with a smile. The harder you work now the more you will be rewarded later on.
virgo,Approach what you have to do today with energy and enthusiasm. Not only will you make an excellent job of it but people in positions of authority will mark you down as someone to watch. Remember, genius is about taking infinite care.
virgo,What seemed so difficult a short while ago now seems the simplest thing of all, which just goes to show how a change of attitude can lead to a change of fortune. Prove to the world you are a force to be reckoned with again.
virgo,Put chores and responsibilities out of your mind and focus on what makes you feel good about yourself. Think of the dreams you had and the plans you made and give yourself a pat on the back for coming so far so quickly.
virgo,What happens over the next 24 hours will bring you down to earth with a bump but maybe that’s a good thing. According to the planets your head has been up there in the clouds a bit too long. It’s time to come back to reality.
virgo,Because tomorrow’s Moon-Mars link takes place in the money area of your chart you need to be careful with your cash. No matter how pretty something may look and no matter how much you desire it, the fact is you cannot afford it.
virgo,You will be hugely ambitious over the next few days and there is every likelihood you will accomplish something truly remarkable. You are right to be proud of yourself but don’t let it go to your head. Remember you’re a down-to-earth Virgo.
virgo,You can make yourself happy or you can make yourself sad – the choice is yours alone. The effort that goes into being depressed can just as easily be diverted into finding things in life that delight you. There are plenty of them.
virgo,You will have to be firm with someone today but you will also let them know that if they stick with you they will get their fair share of the glory. You’re the kind of person who believes in spreading good fortune around.
virgo,If you have fallen behind in your workload now is the time to catch up. The planets will give you the energy to get things done but take care you don’t go too far and work yourself, or others, into the ground.
virgo,There are times when you wonder if certain people are really on your side and it may tempt you to go it alone. But that is not a good idea. No matter how tough and how independent you may be you are going to need allies.
virgo,Sometimes you can be a bit too suspicious for your own good and the planets warn if you take too negative a view of other people’s motives today you could miss out on something worth having. Have the courage to take a few risks.
virgo,This is no time to hold back or fear the future because almost anything is possible for you now – but you need to believe in yourself. If you act on your hunches this weekend you may be surprised how much you accomplish.
virgo,If someone comes to you with a sob story this week you will, unusually, be ready to listen and maybe even to help. But you must still keep your wits about you because there will always be serious con artists out there.
virgo,You may be a bit apprehensive about some of the changes now taking place but the planets indicate if you go with the flow and trust your instincts nothing bad will happen. On the contrary, these changes are designed to make life more rewarding.
virgo,You need to take care when dealing with money matters and business issues in fact there are few people you can trust 100 percent. Whatever else you do or don’t do today don’t let anyone make important financial decisions for you.
virgo,Forget about all the things that have gone wrong in your life and look forward to all the things that will soon be going right. The more you have struggled in recent months the more you will accomplish before the end of the year.
virgo,You may have strong opinions on certain subjects but you need to remember that not everyone sees things the same way as you. Make an effort to find out what other people think – and, more importantly, why they think that way.
virgo,If you need assistance of any sort today you must ask for it, because you don’t have to do it all on your own. You have friends – good friends – who will be more than happy to help you out. So make use of them.
virgo,You are not the sort to let other people’s doubts stop you and that’s good because you will encounter some negative reactions today. The more others tell you that what you are planning is doomed the more you will try to prove them wrong.
virgo,As the Sun moves into the most sensitive area of your chart this week you may be a bit touchy – make that a lot if you are the touchy sort anyway. You won’t do yourself any favors if you let your temper get the better of you.
virgo,You may not be much in the mood for routine activities today but the planets insist that you make a serious effort to catch up on the backlog of jobs you never quite got around to over the previous few weeks. That means now!,virgo,The next few weeks won’t always be easy but that does not mean they have to be hard. A lot will depend on your attitude, especially your willingness to rise to challenges rather than be intimidated by them. Treat life as a game a game to be won.
virgo,You may have a brilliant idea but don’t do anything with it just yet. File it away in the back of your mind and let it simmer for a while. When you come back to it later on it will have matured and you will be ready to act.
virgo,That nagging voice at the back of your mind is trying to tell you something important, so listen to it. If you don’t you may look back later and wish you had been more trusting of that inner part of you that knows all the answers.
virgo,There is nothing anyone can do to harm you, so stop worrying. You may see enemies in every nook and cranny but most of them exist in your imagination only, so get a grip on yourself and start getting important things done.
virgo,You may look calm on the outside but on the inside you are a raging inferno and what happens over the next 48 hours will bring your feelings to the boil. That’s good. It isn’t healthy to keep all that emotion bottled up inside.
virgo,You will be a lot less fearful over the coming week about the path your life appears to be taking. You won’t, of course, overcome all your anxieties at once but as from now you will look on the bright side more often than not.
virgo,What you are being offered may seem generous but is it really that good? The planets indicate that you should hold out for more because you are way above average in every department and are worth much, much more than this.
virgo,The changes that are taking place in your life are quite natural and should not be resisted. Some people may see them as a sign of impending doom but thankfully you are not prone to hysteria. Everything is all right with the world.
virgo,All you want is to be left alone for a while – is that too much to ask? Find a quiet place you can call your own and think about the meaning of life. You’ll be back in party mode by the end of the week.
virgo,Don’t tell others what they want to hear, tell them what they need to hear. A large dose of reality is the only medicine that is going to cure their ills and you are the one to demonstrate its efficacy – for their own good, of course.
virgo,Nothing bad will happen today so long as you stay calm and think logically. Your ruler Mercury makes sure you never let your heart overrule rule your head. That will help you make sense of what, to emotional types, makes no sense at all.
virgo,You will have to put up with people who, for one reason or another, don’t want to see you succeed. As a general rule the more others criticize you over the next 48 hours the more sure you can be that you are doing the right thing.
virgo,It may be frustrating that certain people are putting obstacles in your path but there is no point making a fuss. Just carry on as you are and believe that you will reach your goal when the time is right. That time won’t be long in coming.
virgo,Don’t give too much away about yourself today. Play your cards close to your chest and keep others guessing as to what your next move might be. The less they know the less likely it is they will be able to frustrate your plans.
virgo,There may be an element of risk in what you are planning to do but that won’t worry you. On the contrary, it will add to the excitement and make success all the more enjoyable. The closer you are to the edge the more alive you feel.
virgo,You seem to be interested in all sorts of strange ideas and some people are beginning to worry about the state of your mind. They need not be concerned, you are just going through one of those rebellious phases when you refuse to be logical.
virgo,Someone, will feel the sharp edge of your tongue today, and no doubt they deserve it, but later you may have second thoughts and wish you had not been quite so scathing. Don’t apologize but let them know it’s now over and done with.
virgo,Cosmic activity in your next-door-neighbor sign of Leo may at times make you doubt yourself but today you have enough mental energy to overcome that negative outlook and do something to prove you’re a winner. Make sure it’s something sensible.
virgo,You may not be the most adventurous member of the zodiac but you will be tempted by what is on offer this weekend. The Sun’s link to Uranus, planet of surprises, will inspire you to move out of your comfort zone – and you’ll enjoy it.
virgo,It’s not often you get emotional but you will do this week. Hopefully you will succeed in controlling yourself because if you blow your top you may offend someone important. Okay, so they may deserve it but don’t forget who has the power.
virgo,According to the planets you have nothing to fear, except maybe missing out on a great opportunity if you continue to hesitate. If you’re attracted to someone you must let them know. Chances are they feel the same way about you.
virgo,Less than two weeks from now a new solar year will begin and you will no longer be held back by issues over which you have no control. Stay calm and keep smiling but be patient too. The good times are on their way.
virgo,Don’t worry too much if you fall out with someone today, because you’ll be friends again before you know it. Everything seems more important than it actually is at the moment, so try not to take anything too seriously, including yourself.
virgo,You won’t let little things like work and domestic commitments hold you back today. As far as you are concerned it’s okay to have fun – in fact it’s demanded. That’s what you believe and you intend to be true to it!,virgo,Mercury, your ruler, moves into your birth sign today, making it so much easier to work out what it is you want out of life. Once you have decided, make your plans and then act at the earliest opportunity. Don’t hesitate.
virgo,You want to do something exciting this weekend but because you have duties and responsibilities to fulfill you may not be able to come and go as you please. Remember though: your In tray will still be there for you come Monday morning.
virgo,Whatever else you do over the next few days don’t give in to negative emotions. Life is better than you think it is and is about to get better still. Be patient. The Sun’s move into your sign on the 23rd will change everything.
virgo,You have never been the sort to run away from problems and you must not start thinking that way now. Get together with people whose outlook on life inspires you and soon your problems, such as they are, will no longer exist.
virgo,Your first instincts are usually the right instincts, so trust them and refuse to change what you are doing just because those around you are having second thoughts. Listen to what your inner voice tells you. It knows all the answers.
virgo,You may be finding it hard to keep up with certain developments but who says you have to? Stay where you are and don’t start anything new today. You will get your chance to shine when the Sun enters your sign on the 23rd.
virgo,A new solar year begins for you in 48 hours time and if you wan to get it off to a flying start you must clear as much junk out of your life as is humanly possible. Nevermind that it has sentimental value – get rid of it.
virgo,Today’s events will turn the views you have about a certain person completely on their head. The good news is you will be able to forge a new understanding, maybe even a long-term alliance, which before simply was not possible.
virgo,Any doubts and fears you have will disappear like morning mist now that the Sun is moving into your birth sign. Forget about everything that went before. The only thing that matters now is what happens next, and that’s for you to decide.
virgo,A new moon in your sign on Monday means that all things are possible, even more so as Mercury, your ruler, is also strong in your chart. Put a name to your dream and before the week is over you will be moving towards it at high speed.
virgo,This could be a testing time for relationships but it could also be a time when one particular relationship becomes deeper and stronger. Remember: true love is not about having what you want but about wanting what you have, because then you have it all.
virgo,There is no reason at all why you should be feeling depressed because everything is going right for you now. If you really can’t see that then maybe you need to shift your perspective. Don’t look back with regret. Look forward with anticipation.
virgo,You will need to take steps to control your more negative feelings. Be especially careful what you say in front of employers and other important people. Anything that sounds like criticism won’t go down well – and could be costly in the long-term.
virgo,A Sun-Neptune link on your birthday means you need to balance the two sides of your nature – the logical and the emotional. Try seeing each and every situation from multiple angles. The deeper you look the more meaning you will discover.
virgo,There is no point arguing the toss with people who always seem to take the opposite view to your own. It really does not matter what other people think about what you believe – if it works for you it has to be right.
virgo,A problem you thought was too tough to solve will turn out to have a simple solution and when you see it at last you will laugh to think you made such a big deal of it. Next time, don’t take yourself so seriously. ,virgo,What you need to accept now is that if you are going to be successful, in any arena, you have to take a few risks. Playing safe is no longer an option. Your dreams requires a full-blooded commitment to enterprise and excellence. Go for it.
virgo,If you feel the need to reorder your home life in some way then by all means do so but don’t go making changes that cost a lot of money. There is a lot you can do for free, all it requires is that you get yourself organized.
virgo,Today’s link between the Sun in your sign and Pluto in Capricorn means you are endowed with extra power. Show your best face to the world and go all out to get what it is you most desire. You’ll be amazed how easily it comes to you.
virgo,There will always be those who tell you that you dream too much and should lower your expectations. Don’t ever listen to them. You can be whoever you want to be and do whatever you want to do – not just for the next 12 months but for a lifetime.
virgo,With Venus moving into your sign on your birthday you should breeze through the coming year. But don’t get so laid back about life that you ease off too much and fail to complete what you started. A creative talent is there to be used – and profited from.
virgo,Your situation is not nearly as bad as you think it is and over the next 48 hours you will do much better than you expected. Something related to money or legal matters will work itself out in your favor, so why worry?,virgo,There will be increased tension in a relationship over the next few days but the good news is it won’t make a great deal of difference in the long-term. What goes out of your life this coming week is something you no longer need.
virgo,Success can be yours over the coming 12 months but you are more likely to get the rewards you crave if you stop making plans and let life come to you. Like all Virgos you tend to think too much, but there’s no need – the universe knows what you want.
virgo,You have become a lot more assertive of late but the full moon warns you need to balance that assertiveness with a large dose of wisdom. You desperately want to be successful but your success must also benefit the greater good.
virgo,You must not ignore a loved one’s feelings today, not even if you think they are getting emotional for no good reason. You can and you must show some sensitivity. The fact is not everyone is as rational and logically minded as you.
virgo,The Sun and Saturn combine on your birthday to remind you of the importance of sticking with your plan. No matter how tempted you may be to change course over the coming 12 months you must go the distance. You’re closer to your goal than you realize.
virgo,You are now perfectly placed to make the kind of changes that are needed to make your life more fulfilling and rewarding. For years you have talked about what you dream of achieving – now it is time to stop dreaming and start doing. Start today.
virgo,You will have to deal with some emotionally volatile people over the next 48 hours. Not everyone shares your logical way of looking at the world, so make allowances and make efforts to calm them down. Alternatively, just stay out of their way.
virgo,Profit is important but principles must always come first. That is the message of the stars on your birthday and if you heed it you will not only do well financially but feel you have made a positive difference too. Always aim for the higher good.
virgo,You may not understand how your mind has arrived at a certain conclusion but deep down you know it is the right one for you. It may seem a bit silly at the present moment but come the end of the week it will make perfect sense.
virgo,For some strange reason you will find it almost impossible to get started today. For a workaholic like you this may be worrying but remember, it’s not the quantity of work you get done that matters but the quality. Do just one thing really well.
virgo,If an idea or a belief or a philosophy appeals to you then by all means explore it further and find ways to incorporate it into your everyday affairs. You will be on a search for meaning over the coming year, and what you discover will transform you.
virgo,You may not be able to take your own plans further at the moment but you can certainly help a friend or relative do something that means a lot to them. Who knows, in return they may find ways to help you make progress too.
virgo,You don’t have to do what others expect you to do. You don’t have to follow a certain course of action just because that’s the way it’s always been done. Dare to be different this year. Dare to try new paths to happiness and success. Make your life an adventure.
virgo,The past few weeks have been immensely enjoyable and the next few days will be a lot of fun as well. An important relationship will grow deeper and stronger, not least because you realize how lucky you are to be loved.
virgo,It is only natural that you should be excited about an offer of some sort but you should know there will be even better offers over the coming week. Keep your nerve and hold out for a better deal – sooner or later you’ll get it.
virgo,Before starting anything new over the next few days remember that your head will have to live with the consequences of what your heart decides. In other words, don’t be hasty. So much is changing now that it will pay you to watch and wait.
virgo,You are well aware that various aspects of your existence need to change and over the coming year you will put in place the foundations of a more exciting and rewarding way of life. But don’t forget who you are. Be yourself, only a better version than before.
virgo,A new moon in the money area of your chart means you can easily find ways to pay what you owe. You have never been a slacker when it comes to hard work and you may have to take on a second job for a while.
virgo,If you try to talk your way out of trouble today chances are you won’t succeed. If, however, you come clean and admit you made a mistake you will be forgiven with no questions asked. Honesty is always the best policy.
virgo,Is everything that is going on in your life really as simple as it seems? According to the planets there are things going on behind the scenes of which you are only vaguely aware. Keep your eyes and ears open over the next 24 hours.
virgo,Try not to identify too strongly with what you own and what you earn. As Mercury leaves the money area of your chart this weekend it may be that you have to accept a loss of some sort but it’s no big deal. It’s only bits of paper.
virgo,You need to focus your life in a new direction, a direction more in keeping with your natural desires and talents. Make that your objective for the coming week and, when you feel the time is right, make a truly decisive move.
virgo,Make the effort to get out and about and visit people and places you have not seen in a while. The more you are on the move today the more likely it is you will make contacts who could be useful both personally and professionally.
virgo,A complicated and confusing situation will get even more complicated and confusing over the next 24 hours, so the best thing you can do is to put it out of your mind and focus on something else. You don’t need to know all the answers.
virgo,Today’s powerful cosmic activity means you can, if you wish, force your will on other people. It may be the profitable thing to do but is it the right thing to do? Act only in ways that are likely to keep you on good terms with everyone.
virgo,You don’t like to see people you care for make fools of themselves but it seems they are pretty determined about it, so what can you do? Help them if you can but remember that people learn best from making their own mistakes.
virgo,You would like to forgive someone who has made a mistake but you know if you do they will most likely make the same mistake again. This is one of those occasions when you need to act tough, even though you don’t really feel it.
virgo,Something you have been dreaming of for quite some time is about to come true but with it will come a level of responsibility you may not have expected. The fact is you can’t have one without the other, so take the rough with the smooth.
virgo,You know what it is you desire and you know that if you focus on it to the exclusion of everything else you will get it. Financially things could go either way over the next few days but it’s not really about money, it’s about passion.
virgo,An awkward situation won’t seem quite so awkward once the lunar eclipse in midweek has done its work, but between now and then you must tread carefully when dealing with certain people. They will take just about anything you say the wrong way.
virgo,Work hard today but don’t go to extremes. There are only so many hours in a day, even for a Virgo, and those hours will be more productive if you pace yourself sensibly and don’t try to do everything at once. Be kind to yourself.
virgo,What happens today is likely to throw your arrangements into confusion, but it’s probably not as bad as it seems. Unseen forces are maneuvering you in a new direction, a direction that will ultimately make your life richer and more fulfilling.
virgo,You may have misgivings about a deal of some kind but you would be wise to ignore them. What happens over the next few days should give you a new sense of confidence in what you are doing and where you are going.
virgo,There are occasions, and this is one of them, when your emotions must be ignored and you act on logic and reason alone. Today’s cosmic picture signifies that a practical problem requires a practical solution – so don’t let personal feelings get in the way.
virgo,You may be at a loss to explain how or why something happened but don’t dwell on it too long. Even if there is no rational explanation the fact is circumstances have changed and the world has moved on – and you need to move on too.
virgo,There may be one or two people who disagree with what you are doing but they don’t count. The only things that matter now are that you know what it is you are aiming for and that you know where and how to get it. So get going.
virgo,A relationship that has been a source of endless aggravation in recent weeks will transform itself into something much nicer over the next few days. Come the end of the month you will look back and realize how fortunate you have been.
virgo,Refuse to be hurried today. The more others try to move you along the more you should dig in your heels and demand to know why they are in such a rush. There is no law that says you have to go faster just to benefit them financially.
virgo,The message of the cosmos is quite straightforward: focus only on what you are good at. It does not matter if it has a practical application or if it is going to make you money, now or in the future. It matters only that you enjoy it.
virgo,If life seems to be getting a bit too complicated it is probably because you are involved in too many things. Mercury, your ruling planet, urges you to focus your energies in one particular direction today rather than spread yourself too thin.
virgo,The positive results of the decisions you made a few weeks ago will be apparent over the next two or three days. No effort or sacrifice is ever wasted, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy what the future has in store for you.
virgo,Give voice to what you think and feel over the coming week and don’t worry in the slightest that some people might be offended. The planets indicate that straight talking is needed if you are to get past disputes that do no one any good.
virgo,Think deeply about what you are doing and where you are going. Not that you are doing anything wrong or going in the wrong direction but it’s sensible to take stock once in a while, if only to make sure you get the best from yourself.
virgo,The Sun’s change of signs on Thursday, accompanied by a powerful eclipse, means you are about to embark on a highly positive phase. There is every reason to feel optimistic about the future – well, your future anyway – so cheer up.
virgo,You may think you know everything there is to know about someone but what happens today and tomorrow will make you realize that there is more to them than meets the eye. Of course, it’s no big deal – much the same could be said about you.
virgo,Although your money situation may still be difficult, you will be less inclined to worry now that the Sun is moving out of the financial area of your chart. What matters is having fun and you can have plenty of it at almost no cost at all.
virgo,No matter how emotionally draining recent events may have been you are past the worst and now you can see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. Expect to be rewarded for your efforts and sacrifices today and over the weekend.
virgo,One of the best times of the year is about to begin for you and almost anything you set your heart on over the next few weeks can be yours if you want it enough. Forget about money and relationship worries and focus on the good things in life.
virgo,Be yourself today, no matter how hard others try to persuade you that you can and should change your personality. The fact is you are who you are and what you need for happiness and success is already in your life. Look for it and you’ll find it. ,virgo,According to the planets you need to be a bit more assertive and a bit more arrogant in your approach to life. Too often you act as if you believe you don’t deserve to be the one who wins. The fact is few people deserve it more.
virgo,According to the planets you are trying too hard to make sense of what is essentially a simple situation. Whatever else you do today don’t get caught up in petty arguments – save your energy and passion for the really important things.
virgo,If you feel the need to get out and about you must not deny yourself. A change of scene will do you the world of good over the next 24 hours and could even lead to a work or financial opportunity you might otherwise have missed.
virgo,The future is nowhere near as dire as you think it is, so stop looking for reasons why things could go wrong and trust that the universe in its wisdom will show you what needs to be done. Your glass is half full, not half empty.
virgo,You have so many good ideas buzzing around inside you head and if you bring other people in on what you are thinking you could create something amazing together. Remember: success, like genius, is a combination of inspiration and perspiration.
virgo,Deep down you are a little bit uneasy about the direction your life seems to be taking. With that thought in mind don’t start something new today simply because you feel the need for a change. Your progress must be evolutionary, not revolutionary. ,virgo,A minor disagreement could escalate with alarming rapidity over the next 24 hours. The sad fact is some people are ridiculously touchy, so watch what you say and how you say it. Ultimately, it might be better to say nothing at all.
virgo,Your assumptions about what is right and what is wrong will be challenged today. Have you been following a certain code of behavior more out of habit than conviction? Yes, you have. You may need to change what you believe in. ,virgo,Try not to take anything or anyone, including yourself, too seriously today. Use your imagination to the full, embrace situations that excite your senses and let what happens just happen any way it chooses. The game of life should always be fun.
virgo,You will be confronted with something new today, most likely an idea or a way of looking at life, and to say the least it will intrigue you. Somehow you are going to have to find a way to fit it in with your existing beliefs.
virgo,A situation you thought you had under control is turning out to be more complicated than you anticipated. Be that as it may, in the greater scheme of things it is of only minor importance, so don’t let it wind you up. Relax – and smile more too.
virgo,Today’s Mars-Pluto link in the most creative area of your chart will help you get some sort of project off the ground. Just take care you don’t move ahead too quickly or your resources will soon run dry. Move in the right direction a step at a time.
virgo,The world looks a brighter place than it did a week or two ago and you have every reason to expect that the good times will keep getting better. Your optimistic frame of mind will make even the most difficult of issues easier to deal with. ,virgo,The planets urge you to face up to what worries you the most. You may be surprised to discover that, not only was there nothing to be scared of, but what you have been trying to avoid is actually quite exciting.
virgo,You may be able to see where loved ones are going wrong but unless they specifically ask for your assistance you are advised to keep your distance. If you interfere without first being invited you will cause more problems than you solve.
virgo,Make sure you know what is at stake before embarking on a project of some kind. If those who want to get you involved go out of their way to convince you there is no risk involved then you can be pretty sure there is.
virgo,Some things are easy and some things are difficult but all things are possible. You may have to push yourself a little bit harder than usual this coming week but the tougher the challenge the more you will enjoy it.
virgo,If an amazing idea surfaces in your mind today you must do something with it. Write it down in as much detail as you can straight away – if you have a written record of your thoughts they are less likely to fade. ,virgo,You have more in common with a rival than you realize – in fact you are like two peas in a pod. Therefore, instead of fighting each other to a standstill why don’t you pool your resources and work as a team? You will be unbeatable.
virgo,The outcome of a personal dilemma may be in the balance but you are the one whose actions will decide which way it tips. You can be confrontational if you wish but it isn’t necessary. Use your communication skills to bring people together. ,virgo,Pretend you have faith in someone’s abilities, even if you doubt they are up to the job. If you say the wrong thing now you may destroy their confidence completely. A little subtle flattery will do wonders for their self-belief, and be good for you too.
virgo,In your mind’s eye you can see what needs to be done to make your life more exciting but actually doing it is another thing entirely. Fortunately, the Sun’s change of signs over the weekend will stir things up – and from confusion will come opportunity.
virgo,An unexpected event will disrupt your weekend and to say the least you won’t be happy about it but there is no point screaming and shouting. Stay calm, go with the flow and accept you can’t always have things your own way. ,virgo,The best way possible to handle a dispute is to resolutely refuse to come out in favor of one side or the other. If you play favorites this week you risk making the situation even worse than it was before. Sit on the fence –  it’s what fences are for.
virgo,Your thoughts may be far away but the demands of your current situation will soon bring you back to reality. Work hard and catch up on what you have to do and the latter part of the week will be free for fun and games. ,virgo,Don’t limit yourself to one particular environment today – get out into the world and see as much as you possibly can. And don’t try to limit friends and relatives if they are determined to break out and try something new. Encourage them.
virgo,Sit back, relax and give your emotional and physical batteries time to recharge. Today’s Mercury-Saturn link is a reminder that life is meant to be fun – and also a warning that if you do too much you will pay for it eventually. ,virgo,Make an effort to think “outside the box” today. Sometimes the mental boundaries you set up are far too rigid and need to be broken down, so give yourself permission to think the unthinkable – you may be surprised what you learn.
virgo,Today’s cosmic influences will offer you the chance to break the deadlock in a long-running dispute. There may have been harsh words flying here, there and everywhere but that is now in the past. The question is: can you now go forward together?,virgo,Upheavals on the home front may be annoying but they can also be helpful, especially if they force family members to sit down and discuss their problems. That means you too: keeping negative feelings to yourself won’t help anyone – make them public. ,virgo,You may have to disrupt your routine in order to accommodate someone’s social or travel plans and it’s unlikely you will be happy about it. Never mind. If you show willing and help with a smile chances are you’ll get something in return.
virgo,It may not be obvious where a certain situation is taking you but don’t worry – everything will be revealed in time. Trust your instincts over the next few days and never doubt that you are being watched over by positive forces.  ,virgo,The planets urge you to focus not on the things you want but on the things you need – and yes, they are different. Take care of the essentials over the next 24 hours and everything else that happens will seem like a bonus.
virgo,The task you have to set yourself may seem daunting or even impossible but it is only your negative attitude that makes it so. You will succeed beyond your wildest dreams, now and in the future, if you have confidence in your own abilities.
virgo,You must control any tendency you may have to go to extremes, especially when involved in demanding physical and mental activities. Balance in all things will pay dividends – you will still be going strong when others are starting to tire. ,virgo,Anyone who thinks you lack the killer instinct will have to revise their opinion now that you have a specific target to aim for. Nothing and no one will be allowed to stand in your way – and if your rivals are smart they will stand aside! ,virgo,Feelings will be running high this weekend and you will have to work hard not to let the intensity of the situation get to you. Don’t take what others say too seriously. Most likely they don’t mean it and, even if they do, so what?,virgo,Whatever it is you are currently worried about is actually of little significance in the greater scheme of things, so make an effort to put it out of your mind and focus instead on all the good things, and good people, that remain.
virgo,If you find it hard to get your act in gear as the new week begins maybe you should take it as a sign that you are doing something wrong. Or maybe it just means you need an extra day of rest after the exertions of the weekend! ,virgo,You will need a great deal of patience over the next 24 hours, especially when dealing with authority figures. No matter how much they provoke you do not lose your temper. Certainly don’t say anything they could use against you later. ,virgo,All things are possible for you now Virgo, so set your sights high and don’t stop until you have reached your goal. You will be amazed how easily things come to you and how readily others are to help you realize your plans.
virgo,Don’t let your work get on top of you. There are many ways you can make life easier for yourself and the most obvious is to stop pushing yourself so hard. Everything that needs to be done will get done in its own good time.
virgo,Yes, there are things going on behind the scenes that you know little about but that does not mean they are bad things. According to the planets you have nothing to fear and lots to look forward to, both in your personal life and at work.
virgo,Try to be more understanding this weekend, especially when dealing with people who are in some way down on their luck. Yes, they may have brought it on themselves but that does not mean you should not help them.
virgo,If you don’t protect your own interests over the next few days you may lose something precious. You know who your rivals are and you know what they are after, so it should be a simple matter to fight your corner.
virgo,You seem to be in one of those moods when you are interested only in extremes and according to the planets you will either do something very good or very bad today – there is no middle ground. Either way you will have fun.
virgo,A loved one will be a little too emotional for your tastes today but if you want some peace you are going to have to help them deal with their issues. It should not be too hard: your analytical mind will find a workable solution.
virgo,It’s a long time since you have felt this good and you should certainly make the most of it. If you have a creative or artistic talent you would like to do something major with, now is the time to get serious about it.
virgo,Someone may try to persuade you that a certain course of action is in your interests but you have your doubts. Listen to your instincts and act on what they tell you. Better still, don’t act at all – doing nothing is the best policy by far. ,virgo,Someone will get on your nerves in a big way today and if you make it through to the weekend without losing your cool you will have done very well indeed. Chances are they don’t mean it personally – they’re just panicking a bit.
virgo,The Sun’s change of signs this weekend means you are about to embark on one of the most dynamic and creative times of the year, a time when almost anything is possible. Actually that’s not entirely accurate – scrap the word “almost”! ,virgo,This is potentially one of the best weeks of the year for you as tomorrow’s new moon in Capricorn takes your confidence to new heights. What you start over the next few days is sure to be a success – so see it through to the end.
virgo,This is one of the best times of the year for trying new things, both in your personal life and at work. Make the most of today’s new moon to branch out creatively and do things that have never been done before – at least not by you! ,virgo,There is so much you want to accomplish but if you are smart you will pace yourself sensibly and set realistic goals, both for this week and for the coming new year. Take each day as it comes and live, as far as possible, in the moment. ,virgo,Don’t worry too much if you have fallen out with a loved one. A few days from now you will be the best of friends again, so go your own way until then and don’t take it personally if they don’t seem to care. They do really. ,virgo,Watch out you don’t say too much and let others in on a secret that you really should have kept to yourself. Secrets inevitably lose their value when everyone knows about them, so zip your mouth and enjoy being one of the few in the know. ,virgo,There is something you want to do with your life but it means giving up so much of what you already know. Is it worth it? Can you do it? These are questions that only you can answer. Start giving it some serious thought. ,virgo,Why fight your way to the top when you have the charm to get there by a simpler route? Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn makes it easy for you to win others round to your way of thinking. ,virgo,You have so many things to be thankful for and if you don’t believe that at this particular moment you will believe it in just a few days. Focus on creative activities and affairs of the heart and you will be smiling well into the new year.
virgo,Why do you find it so hard to believe that this is potentially one of the most exciting and rewarding times of the year? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it because some wonderful opportunities will come your way this week. ,virgo,You will be in an open and outgoing mood today but watch out your passion for life does not get the better of you and you say or do something that you may later regret. Thursday’s Mars-Jupiter link warns of a serious falling-out. ,virgo,If you feel tied down by obligations you would prefer not to have then now is the time to do something about it. Resolve to be more independent in 2015. Resolve to put your own needs and dreams first. And mean it! ,virgo,Your energy levels may be high but don’t take on extra work. The full moon on the 5th will give rise to various options you had not considered – and you won’t be able to take advantage of them if you have too much on your plate already. ,virgo,The next few weeks will be special for you as so many of your long-term plans start to bear fruit. Between now and the 20th, when the Sun changes signs, you will do some extraordinary things – extraordinary by other people’s standards anyway. ,virgo,You may be exceptionally busy at the moment but the planets warn you need to slow down a bit, or maybe a lot. You can still get just as much done if you plan your days better and waste less time on trivial things. ,virgo,Get back on good terms with someone you have fallen out with. Most likely they will need a shoulder to cry on when the moon is full on Monday and if you are there for them then all will be forgiven. ,virgo,You need to get tough with someone who seems to delight in placing obstacles in your path. Don’t make a big scene of it, just let them know that if they can’t be a team player then there is no point in their hanging around. ,virgo,Something you have spent months trying to get right will solve itself over the next 24 hours. Don’t spend too much time trying to work out where you went wrong, just accept the situation with gratitude and get on with your life. ,virgo,The news you receive over the next 24 hours could be good or it could be bad – it depends entirely on how you choose to look at it. Do you see the glass as half full or half empty? Do you even see the glass? ,virgo,You are in one of those moods where you will happily do anything for anyone. Most people will appreciate your kindness but one individual may try to take advantage of it. Be generous by all means but try not to be gullible.
virgo,You could find yourself locked in some kind of dispute during the early part of the week and you will simply refuse to back down. But neither will the other side and you may have no alternative but to bring your partnership to an end. ,virgo,Partnerships of one kind or another will feature over the next few days and even if you are the kind of Virgo who prefers to work alone it will pay you to join forces with someone who shares your ambitions. Together you can get it done. ,virgo,If you allow yourself to get submerged in details, whether in your personal life or at work, over the next 24 hours you will almost certainly miss something big. Take a few steps back and try to see the bigger picture. ,virgo,A little of what you fancy today will do you the world of good. Don’t listen to those who say it is wrong to enjoy yourself when so many others are finding it tough – that’s nonsense. Show the world how easy it is to have fun. ,virgo,There is a bit of tension in the air at the moment and partners and colleagues could be difficult to deal with over the next 24 hours. Don’t overreact and say or do things that make matters worse – this is only a passing phase. ,virgo,There is something you have wanted to do for many years but for one reason or another never quite got around to. Now the universe is making it easy for you to get started on it. Don’t hesitate – it’s never too late.
virgo,This is an extremely positive time for you and all manner of things are possible. But it is also a time when you may clash with someone in a position of authority. Under no circumstances back down. You have right on your side. ,virgo,The Sun moves into one of the more serious areas of your chart in a couple of days time. Does that mean you will no longer have fun? Of course not. But you will have to focus more on work and health issues.
virgo,You take your responsibilities seriously, which is good, but if you focus on them to the exclusion of everything else today you could miss out on a fun time. All work and no play is rarely a good idea, not even for a Virgo.
virgo,The Sun moves from one of the more serious areas of your chart today but that does not mean you can no longer have fun. You will, however, have to focus more on work and health issues over the days and weeks to come. ,virgo,If you make a move without asking your partner’s permission today you may never hear the last of it. Whatever you want to do today be smart and clear it with your nearest and dearest first. Anything for a peaceful life! ,virgo,Don’t make any hard or fast plans for the next 24 hours because they are sure to change. If a partner or colleague insists that you change direction, agree with them. It will only be an issue if you make it an issue.
virgo,Be careful what you spend your money on today because if you waste it on things you don’t really need you will find yourself short of cash when there is something you do need at the turn of the month. Be frugal.
virgo,If you are not in the mood for work this weekend then don’t force yourself. No matter how urgent the tasks that demand your attention appear to be they can, in fact, be safely put off until the early part of next week. ,virgo,Make it easy for others to approach you this coming week, because what they have to say or show you could be of huge importance. Sometimes you put on a fierce face without knowing it and it tends to scare people away. ,virgo,This may be a confusing day as the signals you get from colleagues and employers are jumbled to say the least. Your best course of action is to ignore their words and focus on their body language – it will tell you what you need to know. ,virgo,You seem prone to silly fears and fantasies at the moment and that could be a problem today. Wherever you go, whatever you do and whoever you deal with rest assured you will be protected, so don’t let your imagination run riot.
virgo,Someone who never seems to stop complaining is beginning to get on your nerves and at some point today you will have to confront them. Let them know in no uncertain terms that you’ve had enough and they should do their whining elsewhere.
virgo,Try not to make a big issue of something that is really quite trivial. If you are having problems on the work front take it as a sign that you are doing something wrong and make the necessary adjustments. Stay calm and make it work. ,virgo,According to the planets you can do a lot of people a lot of good but only if you join forces with those who share your opinions and beliefs and focus on the same goals. Yes, you can change the world – if you all act together. ,virgo,Don’t try too hard to impress loved ones this weekend because your efforts will most likely be wasted. They have a lot on their minds at the moment so do what you have to do and do it well – but don’t expect lots of praise.
virgo,Be careful what you allow yourself to think this week because your imagination is extremely powerful at the moment. The things you think now will in some way or other come true later on, so be happy and positive at all times.
virgo,Are you inspired by other people’s successes, or do they make you envious? Actually it does not matter which it is because either way it will motivate you to do more yourself. This can be a time of real achievement.
virgo,If you let your worries get out of hand today it may stop you from taking any kind of action and once you stop you will find it hard to get going again. The best way to deal with doubts and fears is to ignore them. ,virgo,You seem to be in two minds about what you should be doing. Of course, that is nothing unusual for a Virgo but today is different because you know that you have to make a quick decision, even if it means flipping a coin.
virgo,You seem to believe that everyone is as honest as you. It would be nice if it was true but it isn’t and what happens today will open your eyes to that fact in a big way. Deals of all kinds should always be made in writing. ,virgo,You may not be able to get into the swing of things socially today but that’s okay. You need to spend time with your thoughts and once you have made sense of them you will be the life and soul of the party again.
virgo,Put all thoughts of getting back at someone out of your head. Aim to get along with everyone you meet. It does not have to be you against the world. It does not have to be you against anyone. Lighten up, it’s life.
virgo,If someone offers you something for nothing this week you should be suspicious. Almost certainly they want to do you a favor now so they can ask a favor of you later on. That should set alarm bells ringing. You’re being set up. ,virgo,If you need to communicate with employers or other important people now is the time. You will find it easy to put across your ideas and make a good impression. But don’t try too hard – make it seem as if it all comes naturally. ,virgo,Push ahead with your number one plan, no matter how many people say you must be either mad or bad. The real reason certain people oppose you is that they are scared you will show them up – and they’re right, you will.
virgo,Tie up loose ends and make sure you have not missed any small but important details. Partnerships and relationships will be under increasingly important stars as the month moves on, so clear the decks for action now. ,virgo,Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours. Friends and family members will quite happily share the burden of what you want to do, so spread the load a bit. Work-wise, make this a day of planning rather than doing.
virgo,Some people stick by you through good times and bad but others quit at the first sign of trouble. What happens today will make it clear who your true friends are and it will cheer you to discover that so many want to help you.
virgo,As the Sun moves into the relationship sector of your chart this week you will find it much easier to let partners and loved ones know how you feel. The words you found so hard to say a few days ago will now flow off your tongue. ,virgo,Creative activities are under brilliant stars at the moment, as are affairs of the heart. In each of these areas your life will be transformed over the coming week, so be upbeat and be on the lookout for the next big opportunity. ,virgo,You may think you know everything about someone you love but they will do something today that makes you realize there is a lot about them you still don’t understand. Is that such a bad thing? It keeps your relationship interesting. ,virgo,As the Sun moves into the relationship area of your chart today you will need to start working more closely with certain individuals. You may not like everyone you have to do business with but in the long-term it will be worth it.
virgo,You may disagree with someone’s opinions today but you would still be wise to listen to what they have to say. It could be they know something that you do not, something that could make all the difference to your future.
virgo,A financial opportunity of some kind is certainly worth pursuing but the planets warn it may not be quite as wonderful as you’ve been lead to believe. At the very least there will be a lot of work involved. Are you happy with that?,virgo,Don’t pull your punches this weekend: tell others exactly what you think and, if certain people don’t like it, that’s just too bad. On the other hand, try not to be offensive for the sake of it. Why makes enemies when you don’t have to? ,virgo,If you are serious about getting things done over the coming week then you must make an effort to consult partners and colleagues first. If you need to ask for financial support wait until Mars links to Saturn on Thursday. ,virgo,With the Sun at right angles to Saturn you will have to give ground in some way. Compromise is not an option, it’s essential. There are times when you have no choice but to work as part of a team, and this is one of them.
virgo,Don’t let anyone pressure you into making a hasty decision today, especially as it will be you who gets the blame if it all goes wrong. Know your own mind and don’t worry that you might upset important people. You’re important too.
virgo,This is a good time for partnerships in general and affairs of the heart in particular, so forget about all the things that went wrong in the past and start thinking about all the wonderful things that will go right in the future. ,virgo,You seem to believe that the universe is against you but that simply is not true. Just because you have fallen out with a friend or loved one over something minor does not mean it’s the end of the world. It’s not even the end of the week!,virgo,You will probably trust what you are told on the work front today, simply because the person doing the telling is someone you look up to. However, according to the planets they have got it wrong and you may not look up to them much longer.
virgo,You seem a bit worried about your cash flow situation at the moment. In a way that’s good because it means you are less likely to make important decisions concerning your finances or business arrangements. Give it time and see how things develop.
virgo,You won’t be much in the mood for socializing over the next few days but that’s okay because there are more serious things you should be focusing on. You may even have to bribe certain people to leave you alone. The cost will be worth it. ,virgo,Not even a Virgo knows all the answers (though you like to think you do) and what you discover today is sure to take you by surprise. It should also make you wonder how many other issues you know less about than you imagined. ,virgo,You more you try to break free of restrictions the more they seem to hold you back. Okay, so that may have been how it was in the past but it need not be that way now. Make an extra special effort to regain your independence.
virgo,Don’t waste time getting other people’s opinions about what you intend to do. Just get on and do it and let the chips fall where they will. There will always be critics, of course, but you are under no obligation to listen to them.
virgo,Stick with the facts today, even if the facts are not as thrilling as you would like them to be. The planets warn if you embellish the truth in any way, shape or form you will be found out and it will be embarrassing.
virgo,With the Sun and Pluto linking across favorable areas of your chart today it may seem as if you cannot lose. But Pluto can be a deceptive influence, so it might be wise not to push your luck, especially when dealing with authority figures.
virgo,You may not get a lot done work-wise this weekend but that’s okay. Even a Virgo needs to slow down, even slack off, once in a while and the less you do now the more successful the coming week is likely to be.
virgo,A money matter needs to be dealt with urgently and the planets will help you make the kind of difficult decisions that you so often try to avoid. At some stage you will have to get tough with so-called partners who are no help at all.
virgo,You have been playing a number of roles in recent weeks but you need to remember that they are make believe and not reality. The most likely reason you have been wearing a mask is to confuse people, but don’t let it confuse you too. ,virgo,You may be logical by nature but try not to be too rational in your thinking today because it will limit you to a smaller range of possibilities. If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, even if logic says it can’t be done.
virgo,Others will respond to you extremely well today – it’s as if they are making a special effort to be nice to you. Take advantage of the situation by telling them what it is you need. They will go out of their way to get it for you.
virgo,The time has come to admit that a partnership or relationship is not working out as well as you expected. It’s no big deal, and it is certainly not your fault. Some people you can do business with and some people you cannot. That’s life.
virgo,What you say next is important but not as important as the way you choose to say it. You may intend your remarks to be helpful but if your words sound harsh others may get the impression that you are being critical for no good reason.
virgo,As from this weekend a relationship that has been going through a tough time will start to get easier for both of you. There will still be a number of highly personal issues that need to be resolved but at least now you are working together.
virgo,Strive to stay calm over the next few days. If you let your anger show it will only encourage those whose main joy in life seems to be trying to upset you. The best way to beat them is to not let their negativity get to you. ,virgo,Stay calm, be patient and don’t try to force the pace. You have to accept that, where your work is concerned, you have no choice but to wait while others catch up. However, where your love life is concerned, by all means race ahead. ,virgo,As from today you will find it easier to talk to work colleagues without some kind of fight breaking out. Thanks to Venus moving into one of the more positive areas of your chart you won’t be at each others’ throats all the time.
virgo,With Mercury, your ruler, overshadowed by Neptune today you need to be careful when dealing with other people. You especially need to be careful if they flatter you because that means they are after something you won’t want to part with.
virgo,An upheaval of some kind is likely over the next two or three days and there is precious little you can do about it. Actually, if you keep your wits about you and keep your emotions in check you could gain from someone else’s loss. ,virgo,Over the past few weeks the emphasis has been on partnerships of an emotional nature but as from today it will shift to partnerships of a business or financial nature. In short: treat other people’s money as carefully as your own. ,virgo,Sometimes you can have too many choices and that seems to be the problem at the moment. Be that as it may you know what you must do and you know you must do it immediately. It’s time to get tough, especially with yourself. ,virgo,Life is too short to worry about things that may never happen, so banish negative thoughts and act as if you cannot fail. A positive mental attitude will bring positive things your way over the coming week. Let others do the worrying. ,virgo,You may feel trapped by certain obligations but the fact is you made promises to people who believe in you and now you must keep them. If you don’t, your reputation could suffer damage it takes many months to repair.
virgo,If you need to get away from your current environment now is the time to start making plans. You may not be able to get away immediately but what you decide today will make it easier for you to make your escape later on.
virgo,Something will happen over the next 24 hours that gives you the opportunity to show how tough you can be. Flex your muscles, both physical and mental, and make sure those you deal with know you should never be taken for granted. ,virgo,If someone says you should not be concerned about what is going on in your social circle you will go out of your way to find out more – and what you discover will astound you. No wonder they tried to keep it a secret!,virgo,If you admit you need help today you will be overwhelmed by offers of assistance. But don’t take the easy way out and let friends and colleagues do everything for you. The last thing you need is to become dependent on them.
virgo,Something will happen this weekend that disrupts the way you look at the world and forces you to question your deepest beliefs. It may not be an easy experience but it will do you good. In future, try not to believe everything the “experts” tell you.
virgo,Don’t waste time and energy arguing with others over trivial issues – there are more important things you could be thinking about. Put your health and wellbeing first now because soon you will have to make some much-needed lifestyle changes. ,virgo,Nothing truly happens by chance and if you keep that thought in mind today you will be able to make sense of something that leaves others baffled. Most people can’t see the connection between cause and effect – but you’re not most people. ,virgo,Don’t visit the same old places today: go somewhere different, ideally to a venue where there is a bit of life. With Mars moving into the most adventurous area of your chart you will be at your best when on the move. ,virgo,The planets are very much on your side at the moment. Mars, especially, is urging you to take a few risks and show the world what you are capable of. The powers that be will respect you more if you fight for what you believe in.
virgo,Don’t wait for others to make decisions for you: make them yourself and, if anyone disapproves, so what? Anyone who thinks you can be intimidated and told what to do is in for the shock of their lives over the next few days.
virgo,Worry less about how you get along with people in positions of power and more about how you get along with people who are important to you on a personal level. Family relationships must always come ahead of your career.
virgo,If you must take risks with money this weekend make sure you have a get-out clause. Today’s lunar eclipse warns you are likely to come off second best in deals involving cash. You have enough debts already – don’t make things worse.
virgo,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means you won’t be so outgoing and expressive over the next few days. If you need to be by yourself for a while then do it and don’t feel guilty about it. ,virgo,Look in the mirror and be honest about what you see. If you can do that today then you will put yourself at an advantage when dealing with people who are not so honest about their own faults and failings – which is just about everyone! ,virgo,If someone annoys you today you will react in a way that surprises a few people – and scares a few more! Yes, of course, you will regret it tomorrow when you have calmed down but sometimes it’s good to get angry.
virgo,This could be a confusing day in that something is so obviously going right for you now but you still feel it could fall apart at any moment. Stop worrying about what the future may bring and start living in the moment.
virgo,If you get the urge to try something different over the next 24 hours then by all means follow your instincts. Leo may be a “fixed” sign but you’re not as set in your ways as some people think – in fact you can be quite adventurous.
virgo,You need to make your peace with someone you have fallen out with in recent weeks. The planets suggest that if you make the effort you won’t be disappointed. Be nice to others now and you will benefit in unexpected ways later on.
virgo,If you want to move up in the world you must make more of an effort to impress employers and other important people. But don’t make your effort too much of an effort: they will be more impressed if you make it look easy.
virgo,Other people cannot give you success and security – these are things that only you can bring into your life. What happens today will give you the chance to question if you are on the right track. If you’re not, then start making changes. ,virgo,You will enjoy yourself more if you are on the move. It may still be early in the week but if you can arrange a trip to some place you have never been to before you should do so as it will open your mind to new possibilities.
virgo,Career matters are under favorable stars at the moment, so be positive and positive things will occur. Attitude is everything: if colleagues and employers sense that you are serious about your aims then they will be serious about them as well.
virgo,Life may not be a bundle of fun at the moment but don’t worry about it. The Sun moves in your favor in a few days time and once it does the smile will return to your face. It’s all good – or it will be very soon. ,virgo,Try not to attach too much importance to material things. Yes, you could lose something over the next 48 hours but in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance. You may even be better off without it.
virgo,So many new opportunities will come your way when the Sun moves into your fellow Earth sign of Taurus tomorrow. Make each and every one of them count. Sheer force of personality will get you where you want to go. ,virgo,One way or another you will get what you want over the next 24 hours. However, you will get it quicker and easier if you avoid strong arm tactics and use charm and persuasion to win rivals over. Make friends, not enemies.
virgo,You must question everything you hear today, because the planets warn that some of the things you will be told are designed to mislead you rather than inform you. You don’t need others’ opinions – you can see what’s going on for yourself.
virgo,You can expect something wonderful to happen today. Most likely news from afar will inspire you to believe that the good days are back at last and it won’t be long before there is even more evidence of that. Start planning your next vacation.
virgo,If your intuition tells you to follow a certain course of action then do so even if everyone else thinks you are mad. When that little voice inside your head starts talking you really must listen – and close your ears to everything else.
virgo,It may be easy to change things but before you start moving this here and that there ask yourself if it is necessary. Chances are you will be changing not because you want to but because you think it is expected of you. It isn’t, so don’t.
virgo,You may have gone to extremes of late but now you realize that compromise is necessary. The planets urge you to seek help from those you love and trust, because their input could be the difference between failure and success. ,virgo,You seem incredibly decisive now and during the early part of the week you will be making calls left, right and center. They won’t always be correct but your self-belief is such that few, if any, will dare point out your mistakes.
virgo,Your sixth sense is telling you that something is wrong with your life and needs to be fixed. So what are you waiting for? There will be a lot of upheavals over the next few days – use them to disguise your own mini revolution.
virgo,Nothing is beyond you now and if you put your mind to it you can reach new heights over the next week or so. This is also a good time to go back and try again at something you failed at earlier in the year.
virgo,Is it really possible that so many good things are happening and that so much is going your way at the moment? Yes, of course it is, and they will continue to go your way so long as you believe that you deserve it.
virgo,Career matters will take a turn for the better over the next few days but to make the most of events you will need a positive attitude. Get rid of those feelings of inferiority and get ready to show the world what you can do.
virgo,If you are not making career plans then you should be. Don’t think only in terms of earning money and moving up the corporate ladder, think too about making a difference. Find ways to help those who are less fortunate than you. ,virgo,Someone you work or socialize with requires your assistance and you must do what you can to help them. You may not owe them anything as such but your kind heart won’t let you ignore their suffering. You’re nice like that. ,virgo,Your best course of action now is to ignore what your rivals and enemies are saying and do what you know deep down to be right. Actually that’s the best course of action at any time but it is doubly important that you don’t hesitate now,virgo,The worst possible thing you can do now is to try to conform to the kind of image you think others have of you. You are who you are for a reason, so forget about what friends and family members expect of you and just be yourself. ,virgo,Don’t overdo it physically today. It may be true that no effort is too much for you while the Sun moves through your fellow Earth sign of Taurus but you have limits like everyone else and if you go too far you could regret it.
virgo,You have your doubts about a plan or project that everyone else seems enthusiastic about and if you are smart you will speak up and start a debate. It could well be the case that your sharp mind has seen a flaw that others have missed. ,virgo,The order of the day according to the cosmos is to have as much fun as is humanly possible. You have been working far too hard of late. You have been far too stressed. If you’re not smiling then you are doing it wrong.
virgo,Chances are you will be forced to stay where you are today, even though you would much rather be on the move. That might sound like bad news but the planets indicate it could be a blessing in disguise. Stay home and keep a low profile. ,virgo,You will be tempted to go to extremes this weekend but the planets warn you will regret it if you do. Tread carefully when dealing with anyone who has a claim on your loyalty – it could be a claim you don’t want them to have.
virgo,Life is too short to worry about what others might think, so do what makes you feel good and, if certain people throw up their hands in horror, take it as a sign that you are on the right track. The last thing you want is their support. ,virgo,There is something you want to do but your instincts tell you it won’t go down well with certain people. That’s settled then: you are going to do it! You are in one of those moods when you enjoy causing a bit of chaos. ,virgo,If you approach someone in a position of authority over the next 24 hours you are sure to get a positive response. They may not give you everything you ask for but they will give you what you need most – exceedingly good advice.
virgo,Play it cool today and don’t worry that others may be doing better or getting paid more than you. It is always a mistake to compare yourself to colleagues and rivals and it would be even more of a mistake today. Your time will come.
virgo,Do not say anything you suspect may not be true. The words may not have come from you originally – you are merely passing them along – but the planets warn it is you who will take the blame. Never trade in gossip or hearsay.
virgo,You have to tell someone you like something that you know is going to hurt their feelings. Get it over with quickly. Say what you have to say and don’t pause for breath. One day they will thank you for being so honest.
virgo,Minor doubts could stop you taking advantage of some kind of offer or opening this weekend and that would be a shame. According to the planets you have nothing to fear, so stop worrying and start taking a few risks.
virgo,Because the approaching new moon takes place in the sympathetic sign of Taurus you can go where you want to go and do what you want to do over the next two or three days. So, what are you waiting for? Map out a route. ,virgo,You will be remarkably outspoken today and anyone who does not want to hear the truth had better put their hands over their ears. You don’t care about hurting the feelings of certain people – in fact they are the ones who need shaking up. ,virgo,The plans you make over the next few days may have to be revised in the light of new information come next weekend, so don’t make them too binding. Remember: there is a world of difference between creative thinking and wishful thinking.
virgo,As the Sun crosses the career angle of your chart tomorrow the next two or three days are going to be extremely important for your ambitions. If ever there was a time to sets your sights higher that time is now. Be the best.
virgo,Try not to think of everything that happens in terms of win or lose. With the Sun crossing the career angle of your chart today you are sure to be more competitive than usual but you don’t have to take it to extremes.
virgo,You must not allow your personal feelings to interfere with what needs to be done on the work front today. Some things are business and some things are personal and if you don’t know the difference it’s about time you learned. ,virgo,Don’t worry if you have serious things to deal with, just push them to one side for the time being and come back to them later. Make it your business to have fun this weekend. Yes, you may pay for it later but worry about it then.
virgo,Don’t be rushed into making an important decision about your career because you cannot possibly know all the facts. What facts you do have may point in a certain direction but can you be sure you are not being misled? No you cannot.
virgo,You may feel sorry for people who have lost their way but you are not responsible for their troubles. There are though some things that you can influence directly. Identify what they are and do what you can, but don’t expect miracles.
virgo,You may be eager to try new things but don’t take unnecessary risks with either your money or your reputation. While your ruling planet Mercury continues to move retrograde you should aim to play safe, in some things at least. ,virgo,Question everything you hear today, even if it comes from a trustworthy source. While Mercury, your ruler, is moving retrograde you should take nothing on trust, and with Mars strong too today you could be ruinously impetuous, so play safe.
virgo,It never hurts to be careful but there is a fine line between caution and outright mistrust and if you cross that line today you may regret it. You have nothing to worry about. No one is trying to cheat you. No one is trying to steal your glory.
virgo,No matter how clever you think you are, the planets warn if you try to fool someone in a position of power today they will find out and you will be the one who suffers. Neptune’s influence on your ruler Mercury is highly deceptive.
virgo,You need to look at what is going on around you coolly and rationally, because if you react emotionally chances are you will make the wrong call. According to the planets there is nothing to worry about, so long as you stay calm.
virgo,You may be the kind of person who tries not to get emotional but Tuesday’s full moon will bring your feelings to the fore whether you like it or not. Tears are allowed, though hopefully they will be tears of joy, not sorrow. ,virgo,If you get the chance to resolve a dispute of some kind you must not let it pass you by. You may have to make an apology you don’t really mean but it’s better than letting a senseless feud drag on indefinitely. ,virgo,Your best course of action today is to sit on the sidelines and refuse to get involved, no matter what disputes may be taking place around you. They are too complex for even a Virgo to find solutions. Let others sort them out for a change.
virgo,You will hear something over the next 24 hours that you utterly disagree with, but according to the planets this is not a good time to make your feelings known. It could be that someone is being deliberately provocative just to see how you react. ,virgo,Someone in a position of authority will challenge you to do more and do better over the next 24 hours and you will rise to the challenge and show them and the world at large what you can do. Your ambition knows no bounds. ,virgo,Try not to worry if your confidence takes a bit of a dive today. Your positive attitude will return over the weekend and you will wonder how you managed to doubt yourself. Friends and family, of course, never doubted you for a moment.
virgo,Should you be nice to someone who is giving you a hard time in the hope that they will desist? Or should you hit back and let them know what you really think of them? Chances are you’ve been too nice of late. Get tough. ,virgo,Stop looking back and lamenting how wonderful things used to be. Not only is your memory likely to be faulty but the past is rarely as rosy as we like to imagine it. It’s today that matters, and tomorrow, and the day after that. Get busy.
virgo,Stop tormenting yourself with fantasies of what might have been and get on with making a better life for yourself and those you love. You have been far too passive of late – get out there into the world and make things happen. ,virgo,Stop listening to other people and start listening to your inner voice for a change. Others will tell you what you want to hear today but only that small, still voice within will tell you what you need to hear. Listen to it carefully.
virgo,If a colleague tries to lay the blame for some kind of failure at your door today you must let them know you do not accept their verdict. Joint projects mean joint responsibility: they would soon claim the glory if it was a success.
virgo,You need to impress someone important and give your reputation a boost. You may have left it late but it’s never too late, so get your act together and make sure those above you on the career ladder know what you can do.
virgo,This is one of the best times of the year for getting along with people, both those you are close to already and those you would like to get close to. A little generosity on your part will go a very long way. ,virgo,You may not be able to explain why the world looks brighter than it usually does this weekend but it may have something to do with getting ahead in your work or career. Be forceful if you have to but don’t forget to have fun. ,virgo,Don’t make too many plans for the next few days because Saturn, planet of limitation, will restrict your ability to move around and do as you please. Duties and obligations you hoped others had forgotten about will soon be center stage again.
virgo,It may seem strange that a rival is now praising you to the skies but there is no need to go on the defensive. Yes, they may be flattering you for their own selfish ends but it won’t do them much good – you’re too smart to be fooled.
virgo,What you say and do over the next few days will make an impression on employers and colleagues, but make sure it is a good impression. Let them know you are ambitious and ready for more responsibility. You will get it.
virgo,Many things are changing now and you will have to adapt quickly if you want to stay one step ahead of your rivals. One day you will look back and give thanks that you were forced to move in a new direction. Today, however, be brave!,virgo,What is most important in your life? The money you make? The status you enjoy? Those things may be important in the short-term but over the course of a lifetime it’s the love you give that makes all the difference. What will you give today?,virgo,Others may say you have been lucky, that you don’t really deserve what you have got, but the truth is you have worked long and hard to make an impression. Luck is what you make of it and you are entitled to enjoy your good fortune.
virgo,Where before you were working by and for yourself you must now join forces with like-minded people and work towards goals that have a wider social importance. Can you make the world a better place? You can if you try.
virgo,Be yourself this week. Important people will look on you favorably if you stick to what you know, but they will see right through you if you pretend to be what you are not. You’re you: what could be more fantastic than that?,virgo,The most important thing today, and for the rest of the week, is that you think for yourself. If you accept what other people tell you without question there is a chance that you will be misled – and that could cost you money.
virgo,Good news on the money front will lift your spirits today but don’t celebrate too much or you could find yourself back where you started. You don’t have to spend a fortune to have a good time socially, even less so romantically.
virgo,You will have to deal with someone today who, to put it nicely, isn’t on the same intelligence level as you. It may be a pain having to explain everything in words of three syllables or less but it’s the only way they will understand. ,virgo,You may be tempted to act in ways that run contrary to your beliefs today, but whatever the material rewards on offer they won’t make up for the fact that you have strayed so far from your principles. Always be true to yourself. ,virgo,Your attitude towards your work or your career will become a lot more serious over the next few days. Even if you are already successful in what you do you will realize there is so much more you can achieve – and that time is running out.
virgo,Take a look at your working routine and then make some much-needed changes. The planets warn if you don’t cut back on your workload immediately you will suffer in ways you had not expected. You cannot burn the candle at both ends forever.
virgo,Because there is a full moon this week you could say too much and turn people against you. Not everyone wants to hear the plain, unvarnished truth, especially when it shows them in a bad light. Always take other people’s feelings into account.
virgo,If you assume that the people you have to deal with today are as reasonable as you are then you put yourself at a serious disadvantage. That applies as much to affairs of the heart as it does to business matters and your career. ,virgo,It is important that you approach people in the right way today. If you come on too strong you may turn colleagues against you. If you are planning some kind of change to your working regime you must consult other people.
virgo,Something you dream about now will become a reality in the not so distant future – and the bigger the dream the more delightful that reality will be. It could also be profitable, especially if you have the courage to follow your hunches.
virgo,Success comes in many forms, not all of them related to fame and fortune, and your task over the next 48 hours is to define what success means to you. There is one thing you must always remember: popularity is more precious than profit.
virgo,Some people say you are all talk and no action but they will eat their words this week as you get serious about your ambitions. Try to remember though that doing six things at once is not a sign of dedication but a recipe for exhaustion.
virgo,What changes over the next few days has been in the pipeline for quite some time and chances are you will welcome it. Yes, it may be disruptive but on this occasion disruption is better than the status quo. Move with the times.
virgo,Your emotions are so powerful at the moment that every little thing seems like life and death, but a few days from now you will get a new and more positive perspective on life, so give yourself time and stop being such a diva. ,virgo,You like to be helpful but you must not – repeat, not – do other people’s work for them. The planets warn that if you do just one little thing for someone today you will end up doing everything for them for the rest of the week.
virgo,It seems you are craving for something, or someone, you cannot have. The good news is that what happens over the next few days will convince you that some things are best left in the realms of fantasy. Besides, reality is not so bad.
virgo,Don’t let anyone tell you what you should and should not be doing. Cosmic activity in one of the most positive areas of your chart urges you to have a good time socially whether or not loved ones or authority figures approve.
virgo,You did not arrive at your present position by chance: it is all part of the grand design. Once you accept that fact you won’t worry so much about what went wrong in the past or what might go wrong in the future. It’s only today that matters.
virgo,If you are the kind of Virgo who always likes to be in control then what happens early in the new week may be unsettling. You will be okay if you take nothing for granted and are ready to change direction at a moment’s notice.
virgo,Why do you believe you have to prove yourself to people you hardly even know? The fact is you are under no obligation to perform for their delight. If anything it should be the other way around: they should be performing for you. ,virgo,According to the planets you are in tune with the spirit of the times and have found your special place and role in the world. At last you feel you are doing something worthwhile. At last you are making a difference. Make it a big one.
virgo,You know that if you take a certain course of action you will regret it in the long-term, so cast the idea from your mind. You’re not one of those foolish people who believe they don’t need to learn from their mistakes – are you? ,virgo,Do you change with the times or do you expect the times to change for you? The latter isn’t going to happen, of course, so forget it and get to work on a project that will dovetail nicely with the new world you find yourself in.
virgo,By all means help a friend if they are in trouble today but don’t cover up for them. The most important thing now is that they come clean about their mistakes, because only then can they learn from them and move on. ,virgo,Don’t hide yourself away where others can’t see you. With Venus moving into your birth sign this weekend you have what it takes to get what you want. And what is it you want most? To be loved and appreciated, of course.
virgo,You would like nothing better than to close your eyes and ears and pretend that the rest of the world does not exist but the simple fact is it does. You won’t overcome life’s challenges by trying to blot them out. Confront them head on this week. ,virgo,Anyone who tries to take liberties today will get a shock. You are in no mood for any kind of nonsense, not even from those who have made the mistake of thinking they have the right to order you around. Make sure it’s a mistake they regret. ,virgo,If you tackle problems one at a time today you will get through the day with no trouble at all. But if you tackle them all in one go you will confuse yourself to such an extent that nothing worth doing is likely to get finished. ,virgo,Some of your ideas may seem a bit far-fetched to those around you but don’t let that stop you from having them. What matters is that you believe in what you are doing and trust that your instincts will guide you in the right direction.
virgo,This may not be an easy time for you but there are a number of things you can do to make life simpler and safer. For starters you have got to stop taking each and every thing that happens personally. The world is for you, not against you. ,virgo,You will see trouble approaching well before anyone else this weekend, which gives you a major advantage. Your way with words will also be good and anyone who locks verbal horns with you is going to wish they had kept quiet. ,virgo,You will see trouble approaching well before anyone else this weekend, which gives you a major advantage. Your way with words will also be good and anyone who locks verbal horns with you is going to wish they had kept quiet.
virgo,You can expect some good news this week – in one area of your life at least your efforts are about to pay off. Be warned though that your health could suffer if you overdo it. Celebrate by all means but don’t go over the top. ,virgo,You need to get serious about your long-term ambitions. There is every reason to believe that some kind of breakthrough is imminent, but don’t just sit there waiting for it to happen – get out into the world and make it happen.
virgo,You may find it difficult to make up your mind today. According to the planets this is because your main problem at the moment is that you are worrying about things that will probably never happen. Lighten up a bit – life is supposed to be enjoyed.
virgo,Little things will upset you more than they should today, but now that you know that you can guard against it. Try to recognize how closely your mental, emotional and physical wellbeing are linked. Don’t worry about things you cannot control. ,virgo,If you tread on someone’s toes today the consequences could be painful for both of you! This is one of those occasions when minor differences could escalate quite rapidly into major disputes, so steer clear of people who offend easily.
virgo,Throw caution to the wind and do something outrageous. Today’s full moon means you are sure to upset people who support the status quo but that’s good because life has been so boring of late, even for someone as serious as you.
virgo,Venus, planet of harmony, is undergoing one of its retrograde phases at the moment and moves out of your sign today. Take it as a cosmic hint that, whatever happens, you must stay cool and not get caught up in other people’s battles.
virgo,You may suspect that someone is taking advantage of your easygoing nature but you are advised not to make too big a fuss. There is simply no percentage in getting angry with people who take a little bit here and a little bit there.
virgo,You may wish you could ignore inconvenient facts and figures today but if you do it will lead to disaster later on. Hypocrisy may not be the greatest of sins but it still won’t do your reputation a whole lot of good. ,virgo,Stand back and take stock of where you have been and where you intend to go in the very near future. Don’t worry that you cannot make things happen immediately – show a bit of Virgo patience. There is absolutely no need to rush.
virgo,If you have any errands to run then get on to them now because you won’t have time for them later in the week and over the weekend. Besides, you will want to spend your time and energy on more personal things. How’s your love life?,virgo,Your opinions on some issues may be fixed but that does not mean you are completely inflexible and some of the ideas you have over the next 24 hours will be so unusual that even those who know you well will be surprised.
virgo,You will find yourself pulled between extremes over the next 24 hours and it’s unlikely to be a comfortable experience. Find ways to put off making a decision as long as you can. You are under no obligation to choose one path or the other.
virgo,All sorts of weird and wonderful ideas will find their way into your head this weekend, but it’s unlikely any of them have a link to reality, so don’t get carried away. It’s good to dream but some dreams are sometimes just fantasies.
virgo,Jupiter’s move into your sign on Tuesday will put a spring in your step and give you the energy and motivation you need to see through an important project. Take no notice of what others say can and cannot be done – you can do anything you please!,virgo,It may seem as if someone is withholding their affections but before you get angry about it remind yourself that appearances can be deceptive. Maybe they are caught up in their own worries so much they don’t have time for anyone else.
virgo,Your mind has been a bit muddled of late, so don’t make any hasty changes. Jupiter’s move into your sign today is cause for celebration, of course, and good things are sure to come your way, but there is no time limit on success.
virgo,You cannot be the life and soul of the party every day and some people need to be reminded of that fact. Now that Jupiter is moving through your sign you will find it easier to use the magic word more often. That word is “No”. ,virgo,It may seem as if you have been working hard on something for no good reason but don’t give up on it yet because some kind of breakthrough is imminent. If you turn back now you will never know what might have been.
virgo,You may feel a bit downbeat at the moment but it’s quite natural for you at this time of year. With so much cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart it would be surprising if you were the life and soul of every party.
virgo,What you are worrying about may seem important now but later on you will look back and wonder what on earth possessed you to get so worked up about it. Why not save yourself some anguish and put it out of your mind right now?,virgo,You have been on the defensive too long. It is time to hit back and make sure everyone knows you are a serious contender. If a major new task lands in your lap don’t worry about whether you are up to the job – you can make it work. ,virgo,You like to be in control of what is going on around you but that may not be possible today. If you are smart you will let others decide where to go and what to do and how to get you there. Yes, you will enjoy the ride.
virgo,Some people may not approve of what you choose to do next but why should you care? Jupiter in your sign is doing wonders for your confidence and you won’t hesitate to ruffle a few feathers if that’s what it takes to get noticed.
virgo,There will be lots of coming and going today and no doubt it will be a bit tiring. Chances are you won’t get much work done but don’t worry about it – this is one of those occasions when you have no choice but to go with the flow.
virgo,Travel plans could be disrupted today but there is no point getting angry about it. If you find yourself stranded midway between where you are coming from and where you are going to just look around a bit and admire the scenery. ,virgo,Because the Sun and Saturn are at odds today it is likely that something or someone will delay or even halt your progress. It may be frustrating but there is not much you can do about it, so stay calm and don’t lose your temper.
virgo,The Sun moves into your sign tomorrow and a new solar year gets under way, but don’t start rushing here, there and everywhere trying to get too many things done. Keep your options open and take it easy, at least to begin with.
virgo,The most important thing this week is that you don’t give others the impression that you are being greedy. If you insist on having more than your fair share now they will come back at you later with demands of their own. There’s plenty to go around.
virgo,You will find yourself completely at odds with what those around you appear to believe but you must not change your opinions just to please them. Chances are your eye for detail has enabled you to see something that everyone else has missed. ,virgo,You are strongly advised to be suspicious of everything you see and hear. Neptune, planet of confusion, is making things harder to understand than they need to be and if you are not careful you could be the one who loses as a result.
virgo,With Jupiter so strong in your sign there is just no way you are going to sit at home watching the TV or reading a book. You want excitement, lots of it, and you will go anywhere and do anything to get it today. ,virgo,If you want something badly enough today you will find a way to get it, but you may wish you had left well alone around the time of the full moon on Saturday. Try not to annoy people who are bigger and better connected than you. ,virgo,You may be in a go-getting mood but you are strongly advised to resist taking risks where the odds are clearly stacked against you. You don’t have to be negative but you do have to be sensible. You do know the difference, don’t you?,virgo,This could be a difficult weekend for you but you can make things easier for yourself by focusing on things that please you, rather than on things that please other people. Life is more likely to be fun if you set the agenda.
virgo,No matter how hard you try to get along with a friend or family member over the next few days they will rebuff your efforts. They obviously need to be left alone for a while, so back off and give them the space they require. ,virgo,If you want others to do things for you over the next few days then you will have to do things for them as well. Someone in a position of power will gladly help you realize your ambitions, but their services won’t come for free. ,virgo,You may want to impress people in positions of authority but don’t go to extremes and make it seem as if you are looking to take over, even if you are. Your ambition is admirable, of course, but if others feel threatened they will hit back.
virgo,Stop lamenting what might have been and start looking forward to what still can be. No matter what has gone wrong in recent weeks you have the talent and the tenacity to turn things around. Your future is a lot brighter than you seem to realize.
virgo,Great changes are possible but you must be honest with yourself about what it is you want out of life. Part of the reason you have not succeeded to the extent that you should have is because you have been unwilling to put a name to your desires.
virgo,If you are the kind of Virgo who enjoys a challenge then you will enjoy what happens today. No matter how tough the task you face or how strong the opposition you must not back down. You can be pretty tough too when you want to be.
virgo,With the Sun in your sign brilliantly aligned to Pluto, planet of power, there is no doubt you will get what you want over the next 48 hours. You clearly have leadership potential but don’t forget that leadership also means knowing when to delegate.
virgo,Where there is a will there is a way and you won’t find it too hard to find a way around an obstacle that has been holding you up. As far as relationships are concerned, don’t give your nearest and dearest any reason to mistrust you. ,virgo,It’s not like you to get annoyed but you will have to deal with someone today who knows how to press all the wrong buttons. Keep telling yourself that there is no percentage in starting a fight or a feud – and keep your distance.
virgo,Someone is keeping a secret from you and it is eating you up inside. The best way to find out what is going on is to feign indifference. If you pretend not to care they may let the cat out of the bag. But is it really such a big deal? ,virgo,You will find yourself in a minority of one today and those who oppose you will be in positions of power. Do you back down? No you do not. The only way you are going to win is if you take the fight to them. Be intellectually aggressive. ,virgo,Decisions you make on the spur of the moment will work out well for you but make sure you know your limits. Also, try not to make promises you don’t know for certain you will be able to keep. Think of your reputation.
virgo,Sunday’s eclipse in your sign promises some sort of new beginning, but don’t just sit back and wait for wonderful things to happen. The more effort you put in now the more you will get out of life on every level over the coming six months. ,virgo,All things are possible. No, really. A solar eclipse in your birth sign this weekend means you must dare to be different. Don’t listen to what those around you are saying, listen to that small voice inside you that is urging you on.
virgo,There is nothing you cannot do now if you believe in yourself. Not only is there a solar eclipse in your sign but Jupiter, planet of luck, is also very much on your side at the moment. What can you do? Almost anything you like. ,virgo,You may not understand how your mind has arrived at a certain conclusion but deep down you know it is the right one for you. It may seem a bit silly at the present moment but come the end of the week it will make perfect sense.
virgo,For some strange reason you will find it almost impossible to get started today. For a workaholic like you this may be worrying but remember, it’s not the quantity of work you get done that matters but the quality. Do just one thing really well. ,virgo,The past few weeks have seen many beneficial changes in your life and before the Sun leaves your sign on the 23rd there will be one or two more surprises. Make the most of your opportunities – you can never have too many of them.
virgo,What happened in the past is irrelevant to your present situation – in fact it’s a waste of time even thinking about it. Look back only to learn a lesson or two, then look forward and, more importantly, start moving forward too.
virgo,The past few weeks have been immensely enjoyable and the next few days will be a lot of fun as well. An important relationship will grow deeper and stronger, not least because you realize how lucky you are to be loved.
virgo,It is only natural that you should be excited about an offer of some sort but you should know there will be even better offers over the coming week. Keep your nerve and hold out for a better deal – sooner or later you’ll get it. ,virgo,Before you accept a promotion of some kind ask yourself if it is what you really desire, because if you change your mind later important people won’t be too happy with you. Only ever do what feels comfortable to you personally.
virgo,If you have overextended yourself in some way you will now have to cut back and learn to live within your means. Your cashflow situation is unlikely to improve until you sell off some of those luxury items you own but rarely use.
virgo,This is an important time for money matters and business issues and the decisions you take over the next few days will set the scene for months, if not years, to come. Once you are secure financially your options will increase dramatically. ,virgo,This is an important time for money matters but you are strongly advised to make no hard and fast decisions until you have talked things over with people you trust. It could mean the difference between a big profit and an even bigger loss.
virgo,Because you are usually such a modest individual it will come as a surprise to some when your aggressive side reveals itself today. If you think you are not getting what you deserve you will make a scene. It may not be pretty but it will be effective.
virgo,Like it or not there are going to be major changes over the next seven days, so prepare yourself mentally. If you find that you are required to give up certain things don’t try to hold on to them. The fact is you don’t need them any more.
virgo,Try not to be too aggressive over the next couple of days. Not only is Mars now moving through your sign but Monday’s lunar eclipse could give an emotional edge to your anger – not a pretty combination! Whatever it is, it’s not worth the hassle. ,virgo,You need to accept that certain people and certain situations are too big for you to handle and focus instead on the things that you can have some effect on. Everyone has limits and your task this week is to work within yours and still be successful.
virgo,Don’t hide yourself away where others cannot see you. With Mars and Jupiter moving through your birth sign you have what it takes to get what you want. You don’t have to be subtle about it either – just charge right in and take it.
virgo,You are in an adventurous mood at the moment and that’s good. You certainly have no intention of sitting around in the same old places, doing the same old things. But don’t pressure others to move with you — they are unlikely to appreciate it. ,virgo,You will be hugely responsive to other people’s moods over the next 24 hours but you need to take care that their negative feelings don’t start having a negative effect on you. You may need to erect an emotional wall for a while.
virgo,If you need to persuade someone to give you something today you will find just the right combination of words and body language to make it happen. Whatever it is you desire they will feel it is their duty to provide it for you. ,virgo,Don’t let others know that you are desperate because it puts you at a disadvantage. You are more likely to come away with what you want if you give the impression that you are not too concerned what the outcome might be. Let others come to you.
virgo,You are sure to make a success of whatever it is you are working on. Others may doubt that you are on the right track but before the day is through you will have won them over with your energy, your enthusiasm and most of all your vision.
virgo,You need to take care of certain duties and responsibilities that you have been avoiding. You have put them off long enough: now you must knuckle down and get ahead of the game, because if you don’t you will fall even further behind.
virgo,By all means show others what you can do today but don’t for a moment think that you are in some way obligated to perform for their delight. If anything it should be the other way round: they should be putting on a show for you. ,virgo,When dealing with people on a one-to-one basis try to remember that some will respond best to reason and some will respond best to emotion. Pick the right approach for the right individual and you will get your way more often than not. ,virgo,You have done a lot of thinking over the past few weeks and you have come to a lot of conclusions about what you need to do to make your life more enjoyable. Now all you have to do is apply those conclusions to everyday activities. ,virgo,You may feel that time is running out, that if you don’t make your move soon you will miss out, but that isn’t true. You have plenty of time to make your mark and what you do today and over the weekend will bring some sort of recognition.
virgo,Follow your instincts over the next 48 hours and follow to the letter what your inner voice tells you. And remember that just because an idea is fashionable does not mean it is right. Fashions come and go but the truth remains constant.
virgo,Some of your thoughts are so outrageous that they scare you a little, but that’s good because the world needs people who think outside the box. Make it your business to stir things up a bit over the next seven days. ,virgo,Cosmic activity in the financial area of your chart will help you find ways to ease your money problems. It will also open your eyes to the fact that you have been letting certain people take advantage of you. It’s time to wise up. ,virgo,This is going to be a busy day, so pace yourself sensibly and make sure you are flexible so you can deal with whatever fate chooses to throw your way. What occurs is likely to catch everyone by surprise, but you will recover faster than most. ,virgo,Now is not the time to be confrontational, either at home or at work. Others will listen to reason today but they won’t listen to anything that sounds like a threat or sounds like you consider yourself more intelligent than they are. ,virgo,The more you seek advice from people you think you can trust the more their ideas and opinions will confuse you. You do not need anyone’s advice, you just need to listen to your inner voice and act on what it tells you. Trust yourself.
virgo,Your power to influence events is limited at the moment but why should that be a bad thing? Do you really need to change things that much? Maybe it is your perspective that is wrong? If it is, expect it to change for the better soon.
virgo,No matter how self-controlled a Virgo you may be your emotions will reach dangerous heights over the next 48 hours. If you do lose your temper and let it all out don’t be too hard on yourself. Negative feelings are better out than in. ,virgo,A few days from now you will look back and realize how silly it was to get annoyed about things which are really not that important. Sit down with people you are not getting along with and discuss your differences in a civilized fashion.  ,virgo,If there is something you have wanted to do for years but for one reason or another never quite go around to, now is the time to get your act together and show the world what you are capable of. Mars and Jupiter in your sign make all things possible.
virgo,Common sense should tell you that you cannot keep up your present frantic pace for much longer, and if common sense doesn’t tell you then what happens over the next few days will hammer home the point, maybe painfully. Slow down and calm down.
virgo,This is a good time to put your point of view across and convince others that you know what you are talking about. Whether that is actually true remains to be seen, but your powers of persuasion are such that no one will disbelieve you. ,virgo,There will be fewer restrictions on you once the Sun changes signs tomorrow. You will also find that money matters worry you less. If you get the urge to travel don’t resist it. A journey of just a few miles could lead to something special. ,virgo,The Sun’s change of signs means you are free to come and go as you please – well, okay, maybe not completely but much more than has been the case in recent weeks. Don’t let others limit your horizons. Have the courage to enjoy your freedom. ,virgo,What you thought would take weeks, maybe months, to accomplish can now be done in a few days, but you must believe in yourself and you must not be afraid to take on your rivals. They are more scared of you than you need be of them. ,virgo,With a powerful full moon cutting across the communications axis of your chart over the next few days you won’t be able to keep your thoughts to yourself. Everyone else has been having their say, so why shouldn’t you speak up as well?,virgo,If you tread on someone’s toes over the next 48 hours the consequences could be painful for both of you. Minor differences could easily escalate into major disputes, so avoid exchanging insults with people over issues of a trivial nature. ,virgo,There is a danger that in your eagerness to get ahead and get the most from each and every situation you will overlook something that either holds you up or trips you up. The message of the stars today is to slow down a bit. ,virgo,Don’t be taken in by someone’s tale of woe because deep down you know it is a load of rubbish. By all means give advice if it is asked for but keep your money in your pocket where it belongs – because that’s what they are after. ,virgo,You may disapprove of what a friend is doing but you do not have the right to tell them to desist. According to the planets they are being forced by events over which they have no control to take a certain course. Maybe you should support them.
virgo,Don’t waste time trying to get approval for what you are planning – you will make more of an impression if you just get on and do it. Strike out in a new direction over the next few days. Chances are you won’t be traveling alone for long.
virgo,If you want to get ahead in your career then you need to work closely with colleagues. You may prefer to be independent but it’s unlikely you will get far if you go it alone. You are intelligent enough to know that, so act accordingly. ,virgo,If you are feeling a bit down at the moment the answer is to get busy on something that requires the full use of both your brain and your body. A social invitation may be tempting but it’s not right for you, so give it a miss.
virgo,The union of Venus and Mars in your sign today means you will be a lot more assertive but also that you will be able to charm other people to give you whatever it is you desire. With a combination like that you cannot lose.
virgo,Little things will get under your skin today and there may be times when you find it hard not to snap at people. Those who know you well will read the signs and stay out of your way. Those who don’t will learn the hard way.
virgo,The more others pressure you to follow their example the more you must resist and do your own thing. Deep down you know what is good for you and anyone who does not respect your right to make your own choices must be told to take a walk.
virgo,Don’t take anything too seriously over the next 24 hours and don’t get angry with people who seem to think the world is coming to an end. There is a lot of hysteria about at the moment, but you don’t have to join in the general stupidity. ,virgo,You need to be aware of the fact that nothing happens in a vacuum, that there are always causes and that causes always lead to effects. Fate does not reward or punish on a whim – there is something foreseeable behind even the smallest of events. ,virgo,Although there is a new moon in the most sociable area of your chart this week other aspects warn it might be wise not to party too hard. You can still have fun, of course, but don’t overdo it – save some energy for the following weekend.
virgo,You will have to adjust your aims and ambitions over the next few days as events over which you have no control throw you off course. It might be annoying in the short-term but the planets indicate that in the long-term it will be good for you.
virgo,You don’t have to try too hard today but you do have to make some sort of an effort. Where money matters are concerned you should check each and every detail twice at least, because errors could have costly consequences.
virgo,This promises to be a fun day for you and if you adopt the right attitude there will be laughs aplenty in all directions. Yes, of course, there are important matters that still need to be dealt with but they can safely wait a day or two. ,virgo,No matter how well things are going financially you cannot afford to take chances with what you own and earn. If someone comes to you with an idea that is “certain” to make money only get involved if you don’t have to invest any cash yourself.
virgo,If you find that your efforts are yielding ever smaller results that is a sure sign you have pushed yourself too hard and need to slow down. Get the balance right between your work and your wellbeing. Nothing matters more than your health.
virgo,This weekend’s cosmic alignment will bring to light something you were hoping would remain secret. Once the information is out there in the public domain there is no point trying to deny that you are the one to blame. Make amends, then move on.
virgo,If you jump to conclusions over the next few days you may find out later they are utterly wrong. On the home front, especially, you are advised to give loved ones the benefit of the doubt even if you suspect they are not being entirely honest.
virgo,Anyone who thinks you will back down when confronted by a challenging situation does not know you too well. You are prepared to battle it out today and while you may not win every fight you will win the respect of those who had doubted you.
virgo,Look for ways to settle a dispute agreeably today because if you allow it to drag it could distract you from more important things. Even if you honestly believe that you are the one who is owed an apology it will pay you to say sorry yourself. ,virgo,Do not allow yourself to be seduced by people who have a way with words – it will inevitably lead to some kind of loss, most likely financial. You don’t need advice from so-called experts, because deep down you already know what the answers are.
virgo,The cosmic set-up is such at the moment that the more you push yourself the less you are likely to achieve, so give yourself some breathing space. There are times when even a Virgo finds it hard to make an impression and this is one of them. ,virgo,You will be remarkably persuasive today: your way with words will win everyone round to your way of thinking and doing things. You will also have to deal with situations that call for a more hands-on approach – but for Virgo that comes easy.
virgo,Some kind of upheaval is likely this weekend, most likely on the home front, but don’t think of it as bad news. It may seem terrifying to begin with but it won’t be long before you realize it was the best thing that could have happened.
virgo,If you get the chance to prove your critics wrong this week by all means take it but don’t let the need to do so consume your every waking thought. Life is too short to waste time arguing with people who seem to be negative about everything. ,virgo,If you start something new today it is unlikely to work out well, so put it off, at least for a while, and focus on making the best of what you are already working on. In a matter of days your life will get a lot more interesting.
virgo,Important people are watching you closely and there is little doubt that they will like what they see. They will like it even more if you give the impression that you are a team player and not just someone who is in it for themselves. ,virgo,The more others tell you that what you are doing is misguided the more you will go out of your way to prove them wrong. The simple fact is you don’t need anyone’s advice – you are quite capable of getting it wrong yourself! ,virgo,Try not to let your emotions get the better of you today, because once they start to unravel it’s unlikely you will be able to stop them getting entirely out of hand. Whatever the problem is it’s not worth getting upset about.
virgo,You have to come to grips with a situation that has drifted on too long and that means taking unpopular decisions. Don’t waste precious time worrying about what other people might think about it, just follow your instincts and do what needs to be done. ,virgo,You will quickly recover from whatever shocks the recent full moon brought your way – in fact over the weekend you will be back to your best. But don’t waste your energy on things, or people, that are of no real importance. Save yourself for what matters. ,virgo,No matter where you might be or what you might be doing over the next few days you must find time and find ways to have fun. You may have a reputation for being serious but life does not have to be all work and no play.
virgo,Not everyone can live up to your high standards so make allowances and don’t make a fuss if someone falls short today. They are more likely to respond to words of encouragement than to accusations that they are not trying hard enough. ,virgo,If others say nasty things about you don’t say nasty things in return – there is simply no need. Those who know you well won’t believe a word of it and those who don’t know you well will be impressed by your dignified manner. Rise above pettiness. ,virgo,According to the planets you cannot see the whole picture concerning a money matter, so don’t make any snap decisions. You may be tempted to take the kind of risk you would usually avoid but deep down you know it is not a good idea. ,virgo,Put petty disputes and disagreements behind you today and give others the benefit of the doubt. Some things are worth getting worked up about but the planets warn that what you are currently getting emotional over is not worth the effort. ,virgo,Disruption of some sort is inevitable over the next 24 hours. Whatever happens, keep telling yourself that it is not as bad as it seems and promise yourself that you will keep your emotions in check. Nothing is worth getting too worked up about.
virgo,Whatever your duties, chores and responsibilities may be for the next 48 hours nothing is more important than having a good time with friends and loved ones. Is that an excuse to slack off and do less on the work front? It most certainly is.
virgo,The wolves are out in force and it is your money they are after. Be wary of anyone who offers you the deal of a lifetime because almost certainly it is a trick to part you from your hard-earned cash. Luckily you’re not the gullible sort. ,virgo,All kinds of journeys will be enjoyable today but someone you meet on your travels could have an unexpected effect on your emotions. Be very careful what you say and do. What seems like just a fling to you may be taken seriously by them.
virgo,Don’t let someone’s selfishness or stupidity get to you over the next 24 hours. Things will go right for you if you stay calm and refuse to let your lower nature take control. If you can rise above petty things, and petty people, you will do okay. ,virgo,You need to get more deeply involved in a cause that is close to your heart. It is not enough just to make a donation or cheer from afar, you have got to get personal about it. Roll up your sleeves and do something practical today. ,virgo,Someone will deliver unexpected news today but if you think about it you will realize you should have seen it coming. No matter what it might be and no matter how much it might upset you just accept it and move on. What else can you do? ,virgo,You may have to get tough with someone today but you know if you don’t do it now it will mean an even bigger showdown later on, so speak up and let them know where they are going wrong and what they can do to put it right.
virgo,You can get your way in most situations now but that does not mean you have an excuse to take liberties. Your way with words will help you charm your way out of difficult situations but why did you get into them in the first place?,virgo,Anyone who thinks they can cheat you will learn that you are not as gullible as you might appear. Mercury, your ruler, is well placed in your chart and that will help you to see things as they are rather than as others hope you will see them.
virgo,The best way to deal with someone who refuses to see sense is to let them get on with it. You have tried to point them in the right direction, so it is entirely their fault if they ignore you and, as a result, make a mess of things.
virgo,Others may complain that nothing much seems to be happening but life is what you make of it and over the next few days you will be determined to make something really good. Show all the moaning minnies what a positive attitude can accomplish! ,virgo,The Sun in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart tends to pour cold water on your plans but there is no need to feel bad about it. In a matter of days your confidence will return and you will find there is nothing you cannot do. ,virgo,At some stage over the next 24 hours you will wish that you were some place else. But no matter how difficult the situation you have to face you will conquer it before the day is over. You’re tougher than you realize Virgo! ,virgo,Don’t waste any more time and energy on senseless disputes with people you do not even respect. Promise yourself, right here and right now, that you will focus on more important matters between now and when the Sun changes signs next Tuesday.
virgo,You may be eager to sort out a money or business issue but don’t be so eager that you miss out on the best deal. Don’t let others talk you into accepting less than you are entitled to – and you are entitled to a lot more than they are.
virgo,The Sun’s move into the sympathetic sign of Capricorn on Tuesday marks the start of one of the best times of the year, for you at least. Forget about what was and what should have been and focus on what is still to come – and that’s plenty.
virgo,There seems to be a lot of confusion swirling around at the moment and you cannot seem to decide whether to move forward or move back. Only you can decide but consider this: sometimes it’s best to make no move at all. ,virgo,The Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today, making this one of the best times of the year for getting things done. But don’t think you have to do it all in the next 24 hours. Have a clear plan and pace yourself sensibly.
virgo,It’s not often you go against accepted wisdom but you will do so today. Deep down you know that your way is best, even if the whole world is against you. You will make some outrageous decisions, and each and every one of them will be right!,virgo,The current cosmic set-up is more than a little misleading, so don’t jump to conclusions and certainly don’t launch into a tirade against someone you think does not appreciate your efforts. Come the weekend they will be singing your praises.
virgo,You sometimes try to make the facts fit the conclusions you have already arrived at but if you go down that route today you won’t much enjoy the consequences. Remember, everyone is entitled to their opinions but not all opinions are equal.
virgo,As usual you are worrying too much and as usual you have nothing to fear. Jupiter in your sign promises that if you make an effort over the next 48 hours you can achieve great things, but first you have got to believe in yourself.
virgo,Cosmic activity around the middle part of the coming week suggests you will have to make a tough choice between your family and your career. But it does not have to be one thing or the other – there are always ways to balance competing needs.
virgo,It may be that you are the only one who knows what is going on but before you go telling everyone what they should be doing maybe you should wait a bit. Towards the end of the week you may see the situation in a very different light.
virgo,It’s not like you to keep a low profile but with your ruling planet Mercury under the influence of Mars today that might be a good thing to do. Try not to draw attention to yourself, either at work or in the world at large. ,virgo,Agree with what others tell you today, no matter how stupid some of it may sound. The planets indicate that everything in your life will work out in the end and that in the greater scheme of things there is no need to fight. ,virgo,If you want to move up in the world over the coming year then you should make your play for fame and fortune now. Even if you are not particularly ambitious you won’t be able to hide in the shadows in 2016, so expect to be noticed. ,virgo,With so much cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn you can and you must be more adventurous. You may feel satisfied with what you have got but more opportunities will present themselves in the early days of 2016. Don’t waste them.
virgo,Be careful what you say this weekend because both at home and at work your words will be taken seriously. Any promises you make will be challenged if others think you don’t have what it takes to deliver – so make sure that you do. ,virgo,As Mars moves into the communications area of your chart you will find it much easier to get your message across. Keep what you have to say simple and to the point and there is no chance that anyone will misunderstand you.
virgo,You may be inclined to let false accusations about you pass but the planets warn if you do your reputation will suffer. Don’t let anyone say bad things about you without an instant response. Stand up for yourself if you want the world to respect you. ,virgo,Life is good and about to get even better. No, really. Even with Mercury, your ruling planet, beginning one of its retrograde phases today you can’t help but be more open, outgoing and optimistic. Whatever you set your heart on you will find a way to get.
virgo,You will want to push your luck today. You will want to take chances. A brilliant link between the Sun and Pluto in your fellow Earth sign of Capricorn means you just know, deep down inside, that you cannot be beaten. Go all out for glory. ,virgo,Something will force you to change your plans over the next 24 hours but you don’t have to abandon them altogether. The route you were planning to take may be blocked but there are other ways to reach your destination. Be flexible in your thinking. ,virgo,Not only are others rather demanding at the moment but for some reason they seem to believe that you owe them whatever it is they desire. That’s nonsense. If anything they owe you for being such an easy-going and forgiving person. Toughen up!,virgo,You may be feeling optimistic and dynamic at the moment but not everyone is as positive about life as you are, so make allowances for those who are feeling down. What can you do to cheer them up? Tell some jokes and make them smile again! ,virgo,The Sun in Capricorn will protect you from harm in most situations but that is not an excuse to take unnecessary risks. The planets warn that if you think you are invincible this week you will soon learn the hard way that you are not! ,virgo,You will always reap what you sow in the end, and if recent efforts are anything to go by that means you have a great deal to look forward to. All that is required this week is to sit back and enjoy the good things heading your way.
virgo,It may be fun pointing out the inadequacies of people in positions of authority but be careful. The last thing you need now is to create enemies of those who have the power to make things difficult for you, maybe even make or break your career. ,virgo,You will find yourself in a position of power today but don’t let it go to your head. If you become too domineering for some people’s tastes you could spark a feud that lingers for weeks, months, maybe even years. A light touch is best. ,virgo,There is a lot of pent-up emotion you need to get out of your system, so try doing something physical, something that makes you work up a sweat. But make it something you can do on your own – team sports could end up in fights. ,virgo,As Mercury, your ruler, is linked to luck planet Jupiter today you will get away with most things, but that is not an excuse to behave badly for the fun of it. People will respect you more if you respect them, so don’t go over the top.
virgo,Keep your emotions in check this weekend and try not to take anything too seriously. According to the planets you should be feeling less and thinking more. You should also be doing more as action is very much the cure for your ills.
virgo,Creatively and romantically the next few days are going to be hugely important for you. Whatever else you do, don’t chop and change your ambitions. Having started down a certain path you have no real alternative but to stay with it to the end.
virgo,Make an effort to see things from a partner’s point of view today. By doing so you will get a valuable insight into their personality, enabling you to make allowances for their behavior in future. Once you understand them you won’t feel so threatened.
virgo,As the Sun moves towards the work and wellbeing area of your chart you have to be sensible about what you do and how you do it. Focus on the two or three things that mean the most to you and put everything else on hold for a while.
virgo,You have a tendency to avoid situations that are hard for you to control, but what happens today will force you to take part in a stressful activity of some kind. The good news is you will find that you do rather well when the pressure is on.
virgo,You are advised not to make any sudden changes over the next 24 hours because if you do you will only have to change them back again later on. Things may look bad at the moment but they are not nearly as bad as they seem. ,virgo,Be careful what you allow yourself to believe today and over the weekend because the facts are not as obvious as you would like them to be. With Mercury, planet of the mind, still moving retrograde you must not take anything on trust, not even your own ideas!,virgo,No matter how shy and retiring a Virgo you may be most of the time you can be a star this weekend. But you must make an effort and get into the world and take a few chances. Be quick: if you don’t take advantage someone else will. ,virgo,Limit what you do this week to the two or three things that mean the most to you. Better still, focus on one goal only and don’t allow yourself to think about anything else until you have finished what you set out to do. Focus always leads to success.
virgo,There is something you need to say and now that Mercury, your ruler, is ending its retrograde phase, you will leave no one in any doubt about what you think. Just be careful you don’t go too far and alienate your friends.
virgo,You are right to be proud of what you have achieved, so let the world know what you have done and let people in positions of authority know you intend to do even more in the future. Spread the word – let them know you’ve arrived.
virgo,Routine matters may bore you but they can be important, so stick at the task to which you have been assigned and make a good job of it. Someone in authority is watching and if they like what they see you could soon be on the way up. ,virgo,You are in one of those moods when you seem to enjoy stirring up trouble. There is something in the Virgo nature that delights in creating chaos and you are sure to say or do something that causes uproar today. You like to see how people react. ,virgo,It is never easy for you to hold up your hand and admit that you made a mistake but you must do so today. No one expects you to be perfect, so why do you expect it of yourself? Despite what some people say you are only human! ,virgo,You will have some remarkable ideas this weekend. With Mercury, your ruler and planet of the mind, empowered by Pluto you must listen to and trust in what your inner voice tells you because it won’t let you down. It could in fact transform your existence.
virgo,The changes that are taking place around you may be unsettling but later in the year you will look back and realize they had to happen. And don’t waste time lamenting that life could be easier – because if it was you would not appreciate it as much.
virgo,At some point today you will realize that what you have said or done has only made matters worse. Of course, if you had listened to the advice given to you by a friend earlier on you could have saved yourself a lot of bother. ,virgo,Ease up a bit. Give your brain a rest. If you are typical of your sign your mind is on the go 24 hours a day and that’s not always a good thing. Even a Virgo needs some down time occasionally. Make this a more relaxed and pleasant day.
virgo,It may seem strange to others that you spend so much time just thinking and analyzing but to you it’s a natural thing to do. You will be in an especially thoughtful mood today, so don’t weigh yourself down with practical matters. Let your mind wander. ,virgo,Why are some people so unable to see sense? Whatever the reason you will have to deal with someone whose grasp of logic is non-existent. Stay calm, make your point, then get away from them as quickly as you can. You are under no obligation to stick around. ,virgo,Even the most livewire of Virgos may start to feel jaded today and the reason is that you are doing too much. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart means it is time to slow down. Don’t do more, do less – but do it ten times better.
virgo,Just because other people are cutting corners does not mean you have to do likewise. As a Virgo you are undoubtedly quicker and smarter than most, so do what is expected of you the way it is supposed to be done and you will still win the race. ,virgo,You will come up with some fabulous ideas this coming week and you will go all out to turn them into realities. You won’t hesitate to roll up your sleeves and get stuck into whatever it is that inspires you. Inspiration plus perspiration equals success.
virgo,Matters of the head and matters of the heart will clash today, so draw up a schedule that enables you to focus on one thing at a time. The key is to not try to tackle two or more tasks or situations at the same time.
virgo,You must have a clear idea of what it is you are aiming for, otherwise you will waste a lot of time and energy on things that don’t matter. Jupiter in your sign makes you rather impulsive, so make a conscious decision not to get carried away. ,virgo,Life has been a lot of fun of late, thanks in no small part to Jupiter in your sign, but don’t ease up too much because other aspects point to a more serious phase. Family issues, in particular, will need to be handled with tact and discretion today.
virgo,Your enthusiasm could carry you away today and before you know it you may have gone too far or done too much. That could be a problem on the work front where, if you try too hard, colleagues and superiors may wonder what you are up to. ,virgo,If you are smart you will get as much work done as possible today so that your diary will be clear for the weekend. Jupiter in your sign makes you want to work hard but it also makes you want to have fun. So do both. ,virgo,You have been pushing yourself extremely hard of late and could do with a rest. You can do yourself a massive favor over the next few days by turning down any extra offers of work that come your way, even if they pay well.
virgo,Be open to alternative viewpoints and be ready to think the unthinkable. The world is changing at a greater pace than ever before and those who don’t try to keep up will get left behind. You must be mentally and emotionally ready to move with the times.
virgo,If you are going to push yourself to the limit, now is the time. You will find it easy to reach targets that in the past you thought were out of your reach. This is also a good time to plan a vacation. Where would you most like to go? ,virgo,This is a good time to face up to aspects of your personality that you usually keep well hidden, even from yourself. Be honest with yourself about some of your more negative thoughts – then find ways to transform them into positives. ,virgo,You may think you understand what makes a partner tick but something will happen over the next 24 hours that makes you realize just how little you really know about them. Never mind. You will get the chance to know them better over the next few weeks. ,virgo,Look for ways to co-operate with others today and over the weekend. Remember, too, that everyone has a good side and a bad side but the good side is always stronger, especially if it is given encouragement. Let people know you like them. ,virgo,You may have no doubt in your own mind what needs to be done but others are not so sure and on this occasion they could be right. Monday’s full moon in your sign will throw everything up in the air anyway, so why take a chance?,virgo,The approaching full moon in your sign means you will find it hard to see things from anyone’s point of view but your own. That’s fine but don’t forget that others will see things from their point of view as well. There won’t be a lot of give and take. ,virgo,A full moon in your sign will help you come to a new understanding with someone you have clashed with in the past. There may be some tension in your relationship but if you discuss your differences you can and you will overcome them. ,virgo,You may fear the worst over a partnership matter but you are being way too pessimistic. Rest assured this is just a passing phase and by the end of the week you will be the best of friends again – and maybe more than friends too!,virgo,This is a good time for travel and social activities but you may choose to stay at home if your ‘To Do’ list is long. You should know by now that you will always find work to do if you look for it – so don’t look for it! ,virgo,You may not take kindly to outsiders telling you how to do things but perhaps on this occasion you should listen. If they are all saying much the same thing it may be a sign that they are on to something. Think about it. ,virgo,The planets warn there is a danger that you could push yourself too hard today and over the weekend and put your wellbeing at risk. There is a simple rule of thumb to make sure you stay fit and healthy: don’t go to extremes.
virgo,Intellectual activities will go well over the weekend, but don’t neglect your instincts, especially when dealing with people on a one-to-one basis. If your intuition points you in a certain direction that is the direction you would be wise to go.
virgo,Do something out of the ordinary, something others would not expect of someone as safe and traditional as you. There may be no logical reason why you feel so confident about your chances but if your instincts tell you to go for it, don’t hesitate.
virgo,Forget about making changes because you are still heading in the right direction. Contrary to what some people might be telling you, your life does not need a major rethink. Just concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other.
virgo,You may fear the worst over a partnership matter but you are being way too pessimistic. Rest assured this is just a passing phase and by the end of the week you will be the best of friends again – and maybe more than friends too!,virgo,It may seem as if each time you have got things worked out someone comes along and moves the goalposts or changes the rules but don’t let it get to you. It is all part of life’s rich tapestry. Change can be fun if you want it to be.
virgo,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your wealth means you must not take chances with money, even more so if it belongs to other people. You would be wise to wait and see what the weekend brings before taking risks.
virgo,You won’t let anyone coerce you into doing things you do not approve of but you must go further than that and extend your protection to cover those who cannot look after themselves. Take them under your wing. Help them get back on their feet.
virgo,You will find it easy to persuade others to do things for you this weekend. The only problem is they won’t do as good a job as you would have done. So you have a choice: do it yourself and end up exhausted; or accept lower standards.
virgo,You may not be the most adventurous member of the zodiac but you will be tempted by what is on offer this week. The problem is that family and friends think you should not get involved. Maybe they know something that you do not! ,virgo,Whatever you turn your hand to today it will work out better than you expected, even if it is the kind of thing you have never done before. You are always willing to give something a go – especially when the doubters tell you it cannot be done.
virgo,If a friend or family member wants to make decisions for you today you should let them. If they are the right decisions it will save you a lot of time and effort. If they are the wrong decisions then at least you will have someone to blame.
virgo,Something you say today is likely to rub certain people up the wrong way and because of that you must expect some kind of backlash. Most likely they will withdraw their assistance but that’s okay, you are quite capable of getting what you need for yourself.
virgo,Look back over the past six months or so and see what progress you have made. Most likely you have come a very long way but there is still some way to go before you reach the level that you feel happy with. Keep striving. ,virgo,Friends can only help you so much – at some stage you must make up your own mind and have the courage to follow your star. Jupiter in your sign indicates success beyond your wildest dreams but the day-to-day effort must come from you.
virgo,Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your opposite sign of Pisces this weekend, so hopefully partnerships and relationships will enter a more tranquil phase. The only danger is that you might become an easy touch. Treat sob stories with suspicion.
virgo,Relationship matters may be difficult at the moment but just because you cannot work out what is going wrong does not mean you have to lose sleep over it. Deep down you know that it will all come right in the end, so why worry?,virgo,Promise yourself as the new week begins that no matter what happens you won’t let it get you down. The road you are on may be a tough one but already you can see light at the end of the tunnel, so keep going and keep believing.
virgo,You may want to discuss contentious topics but others are desperate to avoid them. Take the hint and don’t push too hard if certain people put up barriers for no apparent reason. If you force the issue the results may not be to your liking. ,virgo,Someone you work or do business with is determined to provoke a fight – and you are happy to let it happen. Sometimes it is best to get bad feelings out of your system, and this is one of those times. It will be sweetness and light again tomorrow. ,virgo,If you must point out where other people are going wrong at least try to do so with some tact. If you come across as rude and uncaring you will lose the support of colleagues who could have and should have been friends. ,virgo,According to the planets you have spent far too much in recent weeks and if you carry on at your current rate there may be nothing left. The good news is you will discover a new source of income very soon – but don’t spend that as well. ,virgo,A few days from now you will look back and wonder why you allowed yourself to get worked up about issues that, in the greater scheme of things, are of minor importance. There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control.
virgo,You need to get your financial house in order and with mind planet Mercury joining the Sun in the wealth area of your chart this week that should not be too difficult. But sacrifices will have to be made. A bit of self-denial will do you good.
virgo,Some people will never play by the rules of the game and you may have to put a protective space between you. If it gets really bad over the next few days you must cut yourself off from them completely. Don’t let their guilt infect you.
virgo,Don’t be afraid to make sweeping changes. Don’t be afraid to throw everything up in the air and see how it comes down. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to things of a business or financial nature. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. ,virgo,You have a reputation for reliability and you must not put it at risk. If you do less than what is expected of you today your status could quickly go downhill. Always live up to your promises and always expect the best of yourself. ,virgo,You may think you are good at something but what happens today will remind you that there is a world of difference between the competent amateur and the true professional. However good you may be there is always room for improvement. ,virgo,You will find it hard to sit still today and while in some areas that might be a problem in others it will work in your favor. Just make sure you focus only on what is important to you. Avoid trying to solve other people’s problems for them. ,virgo,If you have made a mistake of some kind then you should own up to it immediately. The longer you try to pretend that it was not your fault the worse the fallout is likely to be when, inevitably, you have to accept full responsibility.
virgo,You are who you are for a reason and must not allow anyone to insist that you change your ways to conform to their idea of who you should be. You are perfect just as you are, so keep doing what you are doing, only better than before. ,virgo,You have won a lot in recent weeks, both personally and financially, but you could still lose it if you push your luck too far. You’ve got all you need and more at the moment Virgo – don’t risk it all by being greedy. ,virgo,If you behave in an unethical manner today you might appear to get away with it, but the planets warn you will pay the price further down the line. Don’t give in to temptation or your reputation for integrity could head south fast. ,virgo,Whatever your detractors may say to the contrary you don’t have to prove that your own beliefs are factually correct. In the greater scheme of things proof is of minor importance – what matters is that your values benefit you personally.
virgo,At some stage over the next few days you are going to have to open up and let a friend know how you feel. Make sure they can be trusted to keep what you tell them secret because the last thing you want is for everyone to know. ,virgo,You will soon have to make a decision about a relationship. Don’t leave it too long or the matter could be taken out of your hands. Deep down you know what needs to be done, you just need to give yourself permission to do it.
virgo,Good news concerning money will come your way over the next 24 hours. You will still need to make savings in various areas but at least you can see a way out of your financial troubles – that fact alone will bring a smile to your face.
virgo,Don’t make a big scene if a friend does something silly today. It will only be an issue if you choose to make it an issue, so stay calm and refuse to let anything disturb your tranquil state of mind. It’s simply not worth the aggravation.
virgo,Little things do sometimes go wrong in life, so don’t lose heart and don’t start thinking that they will never go right again. Bad times are never so bad that they cannot be improved. And good times are always around the next corner. ,virgo,If you are having last minute doubts about what needs to be done you must banish them from your mind completely. You have an opportunity to do something about your financial situation but you cannot be half-hearted about it – be bold! ,virgo,You don’t lack for energy but are you using it in the right way? It may be that you are wasting your time on pursuits that are of no relevance. If so, what takes place this weekend will make you think again. Use your talents wisely.
virgo,The Sun’s transit of the wealth area of your chart will bring your financial problems into stark relief over the coming week. That may not be what you were hoping to hear but it really is time you got round to doing something about them.
virgo,If someone you work or do business with tries to wriggle out of their obligations today you must come down on them hard. No matter what their sob story may be you know it’s a lie, so harden your heart and demand they get it done.
virgo,Be wary of people whose sweet-talking ways you could so easily fall for. Hopefully you are smart enough to realize that most of their claims are dubious at best. The more they flatter you the more likely it is they want to deceive you.
virgo,The truth may be sacred but you are becoming increasingly aware that there are powerful people out there in the world who do not want the truth to be known. Call it as you see it today but watch your back at the same time! ,virgo,If you are dissatisfied with your life then start making changes. The good news is you won’t have to make them alone: friends and family will give you all the support and encouragement you need. It’s nice to know they care so much. ,virgo,Although the Sun has been moving through one of the more mysterious areas of your chart in recent weeks there is no mystery about what needs to be done. Dig deep into your subconscious and locate your deepest fears – then deal with them.
virgo,Your sixth sense is telling you that someone you live or work with is abusing the trust you have given them. You won’t know for sure what is going on until the Sun changes signs early next week but in the meantime be on your guard. ,virgo,The Sun’s change of signs on the 19th is a wonderful omen of success. The efforts you have made in recent weeks will pay off and no one will be able to say that you do not deserve it. Reward yourself in whatever way suits you best.
virgo,A lot of things you have found hard to understand will come into sharper focus over the next few days. Once you are clued in to what is going on you will realize that most of the things you have been worrying about are not worth the effort.
virgo,The Sun’s change of signs today will put you in more of a risk-taking mood than you have been of late. You have taken your turn at being cautious, now you must go to the opposite extreme and be as adventurous as is humanly possible!,virgo,Things are going so well for you now that you may start to worry that the bubble is going to burst. Yes, of course, it will eventually – that’s what bubbles do – but it won’t be for a long time yet, so enjoy that lighter-than-air feeling.
virgo,The Sun’s journey through the most adventurous area of your chart over the next few weeks will bring you success – and bring back the self-belief that has been lacking of late. It’s time to get rid of your doubts. You CAN be a star! ,virgo,Today’s full moon warns that the merest word or gesture could set off an explosion of emotions, so be careful what you say and who you say it to. If certain people do start screaming and shouting just turn your back and walk away.
virgo,It may annoy you that someone you thought you could trust has gone back on their word but don’t make a fuss about it. You may lose out on this occasion but there will be plenty more opportunities to shine over the next few weeks.
virgo,It does not matter what life throws at you over the next few days, you will handle it all with ease. The Sun in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus gives you endless self-confidence, the kind that makes even the impossible look easy. ,virgo,It looks like you have strayed out of your depth and need a helping hand to get back to firm land. There is no shame in admitting that you require assistance – the only people who never do are those who are too cowardly to take chances. ,virgo,Cosmic activity in one of the more adventurous areas of your chart urges you to be original, to follow a path that marks you out as different. You are not now, nor will you ever be, one of the herd. You’re more than special – you’re unique. ,virgo,The Sun in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus endows you with endless self-confidence but what can you do with it? Maybe you should travel more. The same old faces and the same old places are getting boring, so maybe it’s time to explore further afield.
virgo,This is easily one of the best times of the year for you but as Mercury, your ruler, turns retrograde today you must not take anything for granted. Remember too that actions always have consequences. Confidence is good – over-confidence is not.
virgo,You may have above average levels of strength and stamina but you also have limits like everyone else and you would be wise to respect them. Above all, don’t make promises to people that you may not be able to keep. Think of your reputation. ,virgo,It is good that you are setting yourself targets that stretch you to the max but don’t place the bar so high that it is impossible to reach. You should by now have a pretty firm idea of what is and is not possible, especially at work.
virgo,Something will get a grip on your imagination this week and refuse to let go. The Sun in Taurus expands your mind to such an extent that you are happy to consider things that previously you most likely never even knew existed. Think big.
virgo,The cosmic balance is tilted heavily in your favor, so get out there into the world and show what you can do. Don’t worry if the pace of life picks up dramatically over the next few days – others may tire but you will keep up with ease.
virgo,Life has been a bundle of laughs of late and today’s Sun-Jupiter link suggests the fun days are not over yet. Go where you want to go and do what you want to do. You don’t have to apologize for having a good time. ,virgo,You may be eager to get started on a project that, for one reason or another, has been on the back-burner for several months, but wait until the weekend if you can. There is no need to rush – you still have plenty of time.
virgo,No matter how many things may go wrong in the short-term, in the long-term they will work out for the best. If you are stopped from doing something you enjoy today, having to wait for it will make it more enjoyable still later on. ,virgo,Today’s new moon in the sympathetic sign of Taurus means there are no limits, at least not for you. Dare to be different. Dare to be dynamic. Decide what it is you want most out of life and then go out and get it.
virgo,Don’t settle for second best this weekend. You don’t have to be average just because so many others are. Make it your role in life to push the boundaries and set new highs. The Sun in Taurus will help but, ultimately, the effort must come from you.
virgo,Jupiter in your sign makes you feel as if you can take on the world and win, but other aspects warn you still need to do your homework. Get the boring stuff out of the way early on this week, then make your big entrance.
virgo,Life has been one big party of late and with Jupiter in your sign moving in your favor today things can only get better. Eventually, of course, you will have to adopt a more serious attitude – but with any luck that’s still a long way off.
virgo,This isn’t a good day for routine matters, especially if you are the kind of Virgo who is easily distracted. There are far too many things going on in your world for you to be able to concentrate on boring stuff, so think big, and act big too. ,virgo,This is potentially a great time for you but so much depends on your state of mind. A carefree attitude is a must as it will help you find ways to turn minor setbacks into major triumphs. A philosophical attitude to life is what you should strive for. ,virgo,Although Jupiter in your sign is a wonderful influence you must not take things for granted. Other aspects warn not everything is what it seems, so think twice before taking a gamble you hope will pay off. Maybe it will, but who for? ,virgo,You seem to be rushing here, there and everywhere at the moment and while that may be no bad thing in itself you must be careful. Make sure you know where you are going, why you are going and, of course, how you will get back again.
virgo,If you are looking for love you may well find it over the next 48 hours. Today’s Venus-Pluto link means you will get admiring glances wherever you go and whatever you do. One special person will light up your life. It’s passion all the way!,virgo,Someone who envies your success will attempt to make life tough for you over the next few days but it’s unlikely they will succeed. Don’t hold it against them either – it must be disheartening having to compete with someone as brilliant you. ,virgo,You have made more than your share of sacrifices of late but in the long-term they will come back to you in ways that make you feel good. Don’t lament what you lost or had to leave behind because what you gain will be many times better.
virgo,You don’t have to be assertive, in fact you will do better if you let life come to you. Later in the week the Sun will move into the career area of your chart and you will get the chance to shine. Until then, keep a low profile. ,virgo,Follow your instincts today and ignore those who shake their heads sadly because they think you are losing your mind. On the contrary, you have never had a clearer idea of what it is you should be doing. Now you just need to apply yourself.
virgo,Why are you so determined to be perfect? You are a human being and human beings are not supposed to be perfect, they are supposed to make mistakes, because that’s how we learn. If you really can’t stand failure, try aiming lower.
virgo,This is one of the most important days of the year for you as the Sun moves into the career area of your chart. If you want to move up in the world, if you want to be special, now is the time to stop dreaming and start doing. ,virgo,You may be in an adventurous mood at the moment but others are clearly reluctant to take risks. But that’s okay because you are quite capable of going your own way and doing your own thing – you don’t need to lean on anyone else.
virgo,Stay on the good side of partners and loved ones this week. If you fall out, even over something quite minor, it will take a lot of time and effort to make up again, so by far the best thing is to not fall out in the first place.
virgo,Put your nose to the grindstone and get some extra work done today. As Venus moves into the career area of your chart tomorrow you may find that your enthusiasm wanes a bit, so get as far ahead as you can right now.
virgo,You may not be able to get your act together today but that’s okay. You should take the hint and take it easy for a while. You have been pushing yourself hard of late and sooner or later you will need to slow down. Make it sooner.
virgo,You are not the sort to be intimidated by people who throw their weight around, so you will most likely ignore the antics of those who are trying to draw attention to themselves. They are doing a great job of looking stupid without your help. ,virgo,Can you back up your claims with facts? If so, you will do fine, but if there is the slightest doubt that you know what you are talking about your rivals will be on you like a shot. It might be best to make no claims at all today. ,virgo,Your reputation means a lot to you and there is much you can do over the next few days to give your professional standing a boost. If you can be assertive without being aggressive then people in positions of power will look favorably on you. ,virgo,You can expect some kind of upheaval in your work or career over the next few days. The good news is this particular upheaval will open up new possibilities and if you are brave and if you are quick you will profit from them.
virgo,This is a great time to start something new, but if you don’t get whatever project it is you are planning off the ground over the next few days, don’t worry. The new moon next weekend will give you another shot at it. ,virgo,The planets are trying to get you to do something out of the ordinary but your cautious nature is holding you back. Follow your instincts over the next 24 hours, even if they tell you to break the kind of rules you usually follow so carefully. ,virgo,You may find it hard to get along with people on the work front today – either they are moody for no good reason or it is you who cannot be bothered to interact. Don’t worry, you will all be friends again come the end of the week.
virgo,It would be nice if everyone was as logical and practical as you but you know it isn’t going to happen, so make allowances for other people’s irrational behavior. Ultimately, what they do matters less than how you choose to deal with it.
virgo,You need to streamline your daily routine so you have more time to yourself. A change in your working regime is a must, of course, but you also need to stop wasting time on trivial things such as social media. Ration yourself to an hour a day.
virgo,You need to streamline your daily routine so you have more time to yourself. A change in your working regime is a must, of course, but you also need to stop wasting time on trivial things such as social media. Ration yourself to an hour a day.
virgo,On the one hand you need to get things moving, but on the other you need to be cautious. That might sound contradictory but you can have it both ways. Be ambitious by all means but make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for.
virgo,Someone in a position of authority will say nice things about you today, which in turn will boost your confidence. But don’t try too hard to please them or they may start taking you for granted. Make sure they know you don’t work for free.
virgo,The planets warn you are taking certain things too seriously – worse, that you believe you are the cause of a loved one’s unhappiness. Chances are they are turning on the tears because they know how soft-hearted you are. Don’t be taken in so easily.
virgo,You may be in the mood to take risks but there is no guarantee they will pay off. Jupiter, planet of enthusiasm, but also excess, is so strong in your chart at the moment that you need to think carefully about every move you make.
virgo,You need to let someone know that you will not put up with a second rate service. If you don’t they will take it as an invitation to go on offering you less for your money than you are entitled to. Make them live up to your high standards. ,virgo,You are going to have to make some tough decisions over the next few weeks and the first one will need to be made today. Put your own needs first and do whatever you believe is necessary to move up in the world, personally and professionally. ,virgo,Jupiter in your sign endows you with self-belief and urges you to take the kind of risks that faint-hearted Virgos too often avoid. You must, however, avoid extremes. If you know your limits and act within them this will be a wonderful weekend.
virgo,If you hear something you don’t much like this week then don’t take it too seriously. Employers and other important people are likely to be critical of your efforts, but they don’t really mean it. They’re just letting off steam. ,virgo,Do something that takes friends by surprise – and if it shocks them too, so much the better. It is time you reminded certain people that, while you may be cautious by nature, you have a mind of your own and are not afraid to use it.
virgo,Why are you putting yourself under so much pressure? You may think you can take on the world and win, and maybe you can, but why go to all that trouble when you don’t have to? Relax and let life come to you for a change. ,virgo,You may get frustrated with how slowly things move over the next 24 hours but it could be worse. The planets warn if you try to hurry things along you will end up some place you did not want to go or, worse, back where you started. ,virgo,You will perform miracles over the next few days. No matter how hard the task you are faced with you will find ways to make a success of it and everyone will praise you to the skies. Will the adulation go to your head? Probably. ,virgo,Even if you are the kind of Virgo who does not like crowds you are advised to get out and about today because the more you mix socially the more likely it is you will meet people who improve your life. And, yes, it does need improving!,virgo,The more open and honest you are with other people this weekend the more open and honest they will be with you. If you suspect that someone is not being truthful don’t make a fuss about it: sooner or later they will let you know the reason why.
virgo,If you get involved in group activities over the next few days it is likely that you will make a new set of friends. This is also a great time to sign up to good causes of one sort or another. Do your bit to change the world.
virgo,The Sun in Cancer over the next few weeks will bring friendships and group activities to the fore. Also, no matter how traditionally minded a Virgo you may be you will be open to new ways of looking at the world. And you will like what you see.
virgo,Try not to be so negative or critical, either of yourself or other people. You have a great deal going for you at the moment, so look on the bright side. Stand back and see your life from a wider perspective. You are better off than most. ,virgo,You will find it difficult to put your thoughts into words today but in a way that’s good because too many of your ideas are not yet fully formed. If you talk less and think more now your arguments will carry more weight later on. ,virgo,You need to streamline your affairs and focus only on what is important to you. Because you are such a can-do sort of person others are always approaching you to help them out, but your time and energy are limited, so don’t waste them. ,virgo,It might be tempting to say what others want to hear, just to get them off your back, but if you do you may regret it later when you have to tell them what you really believe. Be honest with people, especially those you are close to emotionally.
virgo,There are good weekends, there are very good weekends and then there are weekends like this one – stunningly, marvelously great. With Jupiter and Pluto on your side you will make a success of whatever you turn your hand to over the next 48 hours. Go for it.
virgo,Wherever you feel you have been held back of late that is where you will make most progress over the next few days. That applies especially to creative and artistic activities. What seemed so difficult yesterday will seem remarkably easy now. ,virgo,You will benefit from a remarkable stroke of luck either today or tomorrow, but will you take advantage of it? Deep down you may wonder why you have been singled out for so much good fortune, but everything in life happens for a reason. ,virgo,Don’t worry too much if you find it hard to put your thoughts into words today. The less you say now the more you will have to say for yourself tomorrow when your ruling planet Mercury moves in your favor again. Be patient.
virgo,People you meet while travelling or socializing will be fun and there is even a chance of romance but you are advised not to take new relationships too seriously because they may not stand the test of time. Keep everything on a light-hearted level. ,virgo,No doubt you wish you were somewhere else at the moment but that’s tough because you are where you are and will have to make the most of it. The sooner you stop all this wishful thinking the sooner life will get more enjoyable.
virgo,You are far too sensible to believe every sob story you hear but you are also a generous soul and don’t like to turn away people who come to you for help. Limit yourself to handing out good advice today. Leave your money in your pocket.
virgo,Steer clear of guilt over the next 48 hours, because once it gets a hold it will drag you down. Others people’s misfortunes are not your fault, so don’t let them blame you for the position they now find themselves in. Be kind to yourself. ,virgo,A new moon in the area of your chart that governs friendships and group activities means the next few days are going to be fun. Ally yourself with the kind of positive people who inspire you to give of your best. You will inspire them too. ,virgo,Today’s new moon suggests that while things may not work out the way you expected they will work out for the best. If in doubt about the direction you should be taking get some input from your most trusted friend. Their advice will be priceless.
virgo,Forget about details and trust that the bigger picture is just fine. Jupiter in your sign promises that you are heading in the right direction and all you need to do is keep going. No, your life does not need a major rethink. It’s all good. ,virgo,Put your natural charm to good use and get friends, family and work colleagues to move in directions that are beneficial to you. You don’t need to be rough or tough to get your way – never underestimate the gentle art of persuasion.
virgo,If you do not like the situation you find yourself in then change it. You are not now, nor have you ever been, a victim, so stop complaining that life is unfair. You did not arrive at your present position by chance – and you always have free will. ,virgo,The pace of life is getting faster by the moment and there will be no let-up over the next 24 hours. You may have to cut back on the number of people who have access to you, because you have only so much time and energy to spare.
virgo,Sit back and let fate guide your steps. You may have lofty goals and ambitions but with luck planet Jupiter on your side at the moment you really don’t have to do much about them. Why go searching for life when life will happily come to you?,virgo,With so many influences working in your favour at the moment you can and you must do something special. Don’t sit back waiting for opportunities to come to you, get out into the world and make them for yourself. Your name will soon be up in lights.
virgo,You may think you understand what makes a friend or loved one tick but something will happen today that makes you realize that you don’t really know them at all. That’s what you get for taking people for granted. Don’t do it again.
virgo,If there is something you would prefer the world not to know about you will have to make a special effort to keep your mouth shut today. Even if you are talking about completely unrelated matters you could easily let slip embarrassing information.
virgo,Base your decisions on logic rather than emotion over the next 24 hours. Certain events will tempt you to act irrationally but if you do the results won’t be good. How would you feel if you gambled everything and lost everything? So don’t gamble. ,virgo,Mercury, your ruler, moves into the most sensitive area of your chart today, which means that the next few weeks won’t always be easy. A lot, of course, will depend on your attitude. Pretend life is a game – but make sure you win.
virgo,You need to get over the idea that you have to win at everything. Today and over the weekend you would do well to remind yourself what it means to enjoy the simple things in life, none of which require you to be top dog.
virgo,There is a danger that you won’t let yourself do what will bring most enjoyment this weekend. Just because your In tray is piled high with things to be done does not mean you should deny yourself life’s pleasures. Go on, take some time off.
virgo,Over the coming week you will have to reach a decision as to where your true affections lie. You cannot go on moving one way then going in the opposite direction. The middle ground does not exist, so make a decision and stick with it.
virgo,If others want to call the shots today the best thing you can do is to let them. They may call them right and they may call them wrong, but in the long-term it won’t matter one way or the other. What will happen will happen.
virgo,The more you try to tell others what they should be doing today the more they will resist. No matter how good your advice may be you need to accept that the full moon makes some people extremely touchy, so don’t come on too strong.
virgo,Today’s cosmic alignment warns that the only way to get the results you want is to transform your current situation. Drastic decisions will have to be made but, having made them, your life will never be the same again – better but not the same. ,virgo,This may not be an easy time for you, and the Sun’s move into the most sensitive area of your chart tomorrow means more challenges are on their way, but stay calm. Look at the big picture: fifty years from now what will any of it matter? ,virgo,You don’t trust your intuition as much as you should, but over the next few days you would do well to listen to the voice in your head that is urging you to take a particular course of action. You can make sense of your decision later. ,virgo,It may seem as if the odds are stacked against you, and maybe they are, but the planets indicate you can break through the obstacles that have been placed in your path. Make sure everyone knows you mean business this weekend.
virgo,If you look for the best in people you will find it, but if you look for the worst you will find that too. Everyone has a good side and a bad side. Make it your aim to encourage the good side. Help make the world a better place.
virgo,You will stir up no small amount of trouble by the things you say and do. It won’t worry you in the slightest but some people could be so upset that they go out of their way to hit back. Watch your back over the next few days.
virgo,Others can cut corners and break rules if they wish but that is not an option for you at the moment. Don’t worry if your rivals pull ahead of you over the next few days because their underhand methods will come back to hurt them.
virgo,You may be reluctant to admit that you are the one who was in the wrong but if you want to salvage a friendship that is what you must do. Apologize with good grace and then get on with your life. It’s not the end of the world. ,virgo,You want to be more active and adventurous but something seems to be holding you back. Maybe you should wait a few weeks until the Sun moves into your birth sign. Only then can you be sure of making the right moves. ,virgo,You must, repeat must, stay in control of your thoughts and feelings today. The more you see plots and conspiracies around every corner the more you can be sure that your imagination is playing tricks on you. The world is not out to get you. ,virgo,This may be a frustrating time for you in that on every occasion you try to do something positive forces you don’t understand conspire to stop you, but don’t get upset. Take the hint and relax for a while. Better days are coming. ,virgo,This may be a frustrating time for you in that on every occasion you try to do something positive forces you don’t understand conspire to stop you, but don’t get upset. Take the hint and relax for a while. Better days are coming.
virgo,If you do not feel comfortable where you are then get up and leave. There is no law, cosmic or man-made, that says you have to put your own needs on hold just to make other people feel good. Your first duty must always be to yourself.
virgo,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means there is something you need to clear up before you can move on to bigger and better things. This may be the only crack you get at it, so don’t waste it. Be bold and take action.
virgo,Some kind of upheaval on the home front is likely over the next few days, but the long-term effects will most likely be positive. In fact, a week or a month from now you will realize it was by far the best thing that could have happened. ,virgo,It may annoy you that some people are stuck in their own way of seeing things and seem impervious to logic and common sense but that’s just the way they are. Keep a safe distance and don’t let their idiot ideas rub off on you. ,virgo,As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign today you won’t want to push yourself too hard. Devote yourself to activities that make you feel good about yourself and ignore those who say you are slacking. You desperately need some “me” time.
virgo,If someone tells you something you don’t want to hear you must not take the easy way out and close your ears. If you do you will miss out on important information. You may not like to admit it but some people know better than you.
virgo,You will meet someone who attracts you in ways you find hard to explain. There is something about them you find strange and seductive, something that draws you to them like a moth to a flame. Hopefully you won’t get burned!,virgo,Something will happen that makes you wish you had been less impulsive. Whatever it is though you must not use it as an excuse to do something that is equally impetuous. Virgos are supposed to be cautious, and today that will work in your favor.
virgo,This is a good day for relationships of all kinds but especially those that come from the heart. If you give loved ones the affection they deserve you will get it all back and more in the days, weeks and months to follow. Let your heart rule.
virgo,If something goes wrong today, and almost certainly it will, there is no need to panic and there is no need to change what you are doing. The planets indicate that by this time tomorrow everything will be right with your world again.
virgo,Be generous today, especially when dealing with people who are not lucky enough to enjoy the kind of good things that are coming your way. We each have our own destiny, of course, but that does not have to stop you from giving to those in need.
virgo,It may be tempting to come down to someone else’s level and allow the disagreement between you to get heated but why lower yourself? There is really no need for you to punish them: their own negative attitude is punishment enough. ,virgo,You will get the chance to prove your critics wrong today and you must take it. Do what you have to do, do it brilliantly and then move on. Life is too short to waste time arguing with people who seem to have a negative attitude toward everything.
virgo,You will struggle to stay on top of your workload over the next few days, but only because the deadlines you have set yourself are too rigid. No one will think less of you if you take a bit longer to get it all done.
virgo,Whatever bad things others say or do today you must rise above it all and focus only on positive thoughts and emotions. Others may seek to revenge themselves on you but you must not seek revenge in turn. Everything balances out in the end.
virgo,You are under no illusions about what needs to be done and you are also smart enough to realize there can be no shortcuts. Dedicate yourself to making the best possible job of it and you’ll be top dog by the end of the week.
virgo,You will have to deal with someone today whose words and actions you do not approve of. Do what you have to do in a professional manner then go your separate ways. There is no law that says you have to be friends.
virgo,Believe what you want to believe today and don’t worry in the slightest if important people do not agree with you. You have every right to have your own opinion, and every right to express it, loudly if you think it necessary.
virgo,If you start something new today it may not work out the way you were expecting, so put it off a while and focus on making the best of what you are already doing. In a matter of days your life will get a lot more interesting.
virgo,The doubts and fears of the past few weeks will fade this weekend and by the time the Sun moves into your sign on Monday you will be eager to start something new. You don’t have to make any grand plans, just get on and do it.
virgo,This is one of the best times of the year for you and the Sun’s move into your sign tomorrow will give you the confidence to try things that may have been too much for you before. Do your homework first though. Don’t take foolish risks.
virgo,The Sun moves into your sign today and a new solar year begins. You have done a lot of thinking in recent weeks and you should by now have some sort of plan. What is your first step going to be? Don’t think any more, just take it!,virgo,You will need to be on top form today, physically, mentally and emotionally. The Sun in your sign means the pace of life will increase dramatically, but you should have no trouble keeping up. Opportunities will open up for you in every direction.
virgo,The more you try to stop friends and family members doing what they want to do the more effort they will put into doing it. You need to accept that different people have different needs and different ways of doing things. Don’t be so judgmental.
virgo,The Sun in your sign endows you with a great deal of self-belief but that won’t save you if you make a mess of something the powers that be were expecting you to get right. Too much confidence is not always a good thing. Think of your reputation. ,virgo,It’s not like you to be aggressive but there will be times today when you struggle to control your temper. No doubt some people deserve to feel the rough edge of your tongue but don’t overdo it. The penalty must always reflect the crime.
virgo,You don’t have to do anything special, you just have to sit back and enjoy all the good things that life brings your way. Can it really be that simple? Yes it can, so forget about your worries and woes and focus on your dreams. They could come true.
virgo,Check, check and check again is the message of the stars for the coming week. It may seem as if something you are working on is going according to plan but the planets warn you have overlooked some important details. That’s not like you at all!,virgo,Put your friends first today and don’t hesitate to make a personal sacrifice if required to do so. There will be some interesting developments in your social life over the next few days, so don’t limit your horizons to places you already know well.
virgo,Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart warns that any miscalculations you may have made in recent weeks will be evident to everyone now. Don’t try to spend your way out of trouble – most likely that will make matters worse.
virgo,This is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, both in your personal life and on the work front, so don’t let doubts and fears hold you back. Positive thoughts will bring positive results – that’s a cosmic guarantee. ,virgo,You have made a huge amount of progress in recent weeks and today’s solar eclipse in your sign will in some way or other reward you handsomely. But don’t stop there. Now you have got some momentum going you must keep it going. ,virgo,Aim to see things as they are rather than as you wish they might be. If you have in any way been deceiving yourself as to the true nature of your current situation you will now have to admit that you got it wrong. ,virgo,There is no way you are going to sit back and let your rivals take the applause. If you feel you have missed out on your rightful share of the spoils you will more than make up for it this weekend. Yes, you can have it all!,virgo,You will at last be able to think clearly and let partners and colleagues and loved ones know what it is you desire. This is still one of the best times of the year for you, so don’t hold back: let the world know you are in charge. ,virgo,The Sun in your sign means you don’t lack for confidence but you must still think before you act. If you take too many risks, especially around the middle part of the week, it could cost you dear, not only financially but emotionally too.
virgo,Some people seem to believe they can tell you what to do any time they like and you will jump at their command. Some people are in for a shock. You will need to remind them that you give orders to them, not the other way round. ,virgo,Something will challenge you to such an extent today that you just have to react. But make sure you know what is really going on. If you get the wrong end of the stick there’s a worrying chance you will end up getting beaten with it. ,virgo,You will need to spell out in simple language what it is you expect of other people today, because if you leave room for doubt they will pretend they are confused and not give you the assistance you desire. Plain speaking is a must.
virgo,You need to be more selective about what you do with your money. Jupiter in your sign over the past year or so has brought many benefits but it has also made you a bit wasteful financially. Time to get your act together. ,virgo,Your “I’ll do what I want to do and to hell with the consequences” attitude is admirable but it could also land you in a whole heap of trouble. Both socially and on the work front try to remember that other people exist too.
virgo,You will be rather impatient over the coming week and anyone who does not think or act as quickly as you is likely to get flattened as you come charging through. Try not to alienate everyone though – you still need to keep some people as friends.
virgo,You need to be aware of your limits and you need to make sure you don’t go beyond them. This is still your time of year but if you push too hard accidents could happen. Be wary too of making promises you may not be able to keep.
virgo,Today’s Sun-Mars link makes it easy for you to open up and let others know how you think and how you feel. They may be a bit shocked by what you have to say but that’s good – they need to be aware that your patience has limits.
virgo,You may not have a care in the world at the moment but you still need to be cautious. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse will disrupt your plans and remind you how little control over events you actually have. A more realistic attitude is a must. ,virgo,The Sun in your sign gives you no end of confidence but today’s eclipse warns that a relationship crisis of some sort will throw you off your stride. Don’t hold on too tightly where love is concerned. You can never truly own another person. ,virgo,Make sure you give the impression that you know what you are doing, even if you don’t have the first idea! Employers and other important people are unlikely to call your bluff so you stand a good chance of getting away with it.
virgo,You may have strong opinions about certain issues but what happens this week will compel you to question them deeply. You may not want to admit that you were wrong but on this occasion you may have no choice. The evidence is all against you. ,virgo,Give your mind permission to explore and don’t reject what it comes up with just because it seems outrageous. The world is full of useful things that to begin with were thought of as crazy. Let the genius within you rise to the surface.
virgo,Your powers of persuasion are unusually high at the moment, so if there is something you need you must let others know about it. You won’t get it for free, of course, but it won’t cost you anywhere near as much as you expected. ,virgo,You need to get a bit more serious about your cashflow situation – okay, make that a lot. It does not matter that you have been free and easy with cash in recent weeks, what matters is that you act more responsibly from now on. ,virgo,You may think you have to work hard and look serious but the planets tell a different story. This is one of those days when, if you sit back and let things happen life will be perfect in every possible way – and maybe a few impossible ways too. ,virgo,Your resources have been stretched a bit thin in recent weeks and because of that you will need to find ways to earn more – and you will need to spend less too. Cut back on your commitments and make do with the possessions you already have.
virgo,Something you have dreamed of owning for quite some time is now well within your grasp. However, having got it you must not hold on to it too tightly. Too much possessiveness is not a good thing, so make sure your grip remains loose.
virgo,Be modest and let others take some of the credit for your recent successes. If you say nice things about partners and colleagues now they are more likely to give you a free hand later when there is even more rewarding work to be done.
virgo,As energy planet Mars moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today you must stop feeling sorry for yourself and start doing the things that will make your existence more enjoyable. What is it you desire above all other things? Go get it!,virgo,Let the cosmic forces blow you where they will and make the best of whatever situation you happen to find yourself in. Now that Mars is moving in your favour again you have what it takes to meet any and every challenge.
virgo,You can, if you wish, force others to do your bidding but what is the point when they would quite happily fulfill your desires if you ask nicely? You don’t need to bash people over the head to get their attention today. Chill out. ,virgo,You will notice a distinct difference in the direction your life is taking today and over the weekend. The important thing is that you don’t fight against it. Life moves in cycles and if you want to be happy you must go with the flow.
virgo,It may seem as if your cashflow problems are too big to cope with but don’t throw in the towel just yet. What happens over the next 48 hours will remind you that you are never alone, that if you ask for assistance it will be given.
virgo,For some time now you have drifted along not caring where your next dollar is going to come from, but those carefree days are numbered. Start making savings now, today, this very moment, or there could be a painful reckoning quite soon.
virgo,Be extra careful when dealing with your cash and possessions. It’s unlikely that anyone will try to cheat you but you might end up cheating yourself by being a bit slapdash and overlooking something that could have saved you money. ,virgo,You want to rush in and get things done but a voice in your head warns that may not be a good idea. You would be wise to be a bit more cautious than usual – make that a lot where family and financial matters are concerned.
virgo,You may be tempted to just take what you want today but if you do the consequences could be unexpectedly dramatic. The planets warn if you act in a selfish manner now others will act even worse toward you later on in the month. ,virgo,The facts may be on your side but don’t make a big noise about it. You may win the argument but if you are not gracious in victory you could cause a lot of resentment. It’s nice to be right but there are more important things in life. ,virgo,If certain facts and figures do not add up today make it your task to find out why and, having found out, make sure everyone knows about it. No doubt it will make you unpopular with some people but that’s their problem, not yours! ,virgo,Don’t get carried away with an idea that comes at you out of the blue. Yes, it could be the answer to your prayers, but it could also be an illusion cooked up by your overactive imagination. What happened to that sensible Virgo we all know and love?,virgo,Be generous with your time and money and don’t worry that you may never get back as much as you give. When it comes to one-to-one relationships you must not think in terms of profit and loss. Think in terms of love instead. ,virgo,A relationship will come under pressure today and if you say the wrong thing it could so easily come to an end. Tomorrow, of course, you will regret having opened your mouth but by then it may be too late, so play safe and keep quiet!,virgo,A lot of great things seem to be landing in your lap and there will be moments today when you wonder if you deserve so much good fortune. Maybe you do and maybe you don’t but, whatever the answer, don’t let it stop you enjoying life. ,virgo,There are so many distractions in your life at the moment and that could be a big problem. If you are unable to focus on the two or three things that are of genuine importance you could lose out financially, and maybe emotionally too. ,virgo,The tempo of life will pick up over the next few days – can you stand the pace? Of course you can: you’re a Virgo and adept at burning candles at both ends. Creative activities of all kinds will go well for you now, so don’t be afraid to take risks. ,virgo,Money matters will take up most of your time over the next 24 hours and you are right to take them seriously. The more financial loose ends you can tie up now the more fun you will have during the second half of the month. ,virgo,Something you have been worrying about for weeks, months, maybe even years needs to be dealt with once and for all and then forgotten. It does not matter what you actually do, so long as you take a decision and see it through to the end.
virgo,You are in an impulsive mood right now and if you are not careful you could fall out with someone you should be on good terms with. There is no point throwing away your friendship just because you don’t care for their methods.
virgo,Partners and loved ones may be a bit negative in their thinking today and it will annoy you that for each suggestion you come up with they have a ready-made reason not to proceed. But do you really need their help? Why not go it alone?,virgo,What happens over the next 24 to 48 hours may have an unsettling effect on your confidence but don’t let it worry you too much. If you allow self-doubt to get a grip it may be a long time before you are free of it again.
virgo,Be wary of anyone who says it is okay to take a gamble, that it’s just a bit of fun. With the Sun moving through the money area of your chart you need to be cautious or you could find yourself in debt – and that’s no fun at all.
virgo,One of the most enjoyable times of the year is about to begin, so why are you still so pessimistic? The world won’t be impressed if all they see is a glum look on your face. Smile – it’s not hard and it makes life so much easier.
virgo,There are a lot of things you need to say and with the Sun moving into the communications area of your chart this weekend you won’t hold back. Some people may find that the truth hurts but lying will, in the long-term, hurt more. ,virgo,Sometimes you are suspicious for no good reason but over the next few days you will go right the other way and trust everyone – and, amazingly, your trust will pay off. The world wants to see you succeed – and you won’t disappoint it.
virgo,You have become a bit too predictable and need to do something to remind the world that you are still in the game. You don’t have to go to extremes, just be yourself and do what comes naturally – that will be enough to shock most people!,virgo,You may be desperate to prove yourself but there is a danger that you will go too far and do too much and make things worse for yourself in the long-term. Calm down. Believe it or not you are on the right track and doing fine.
virgo,Your confidence has taken a bit of a battering of late and what happens today will be yet another challenge to your self belief. Fortunately, you are at your best when the heat is on. What does not destroy you is sure to make you stronger. ,virgo,If there is someone you need to impress, someone on whom your future professional and financial situation could depend, now is the time to turn on the charm and win them over to your side. Turn on the charm and back it up with ambition. ,virgo,Focus your attention on your home and your family today. Sometimes you get so caught up in making your way in the world that you forget there are people who love you and care nothing about your status or your financial position. ,virgo,Mars, planet of energy, is very much on your side at the moment, so make an effort to move up in the world and make sure others know what you are worth. Everyone loves a winner and everyone will love you if you believe in yourself.
virgo,You seem to believe that you can get away with anything now, and maybe you can, but don’t get carried away and start believing you are untouchable. The cosmic powers that be have a way of cutting outside egos down to size, so watch out.
virgo,You may be enthusiastic about a new plan or project but how much is it going to cost? If you throw yourself at it without thinking things through you could find later on that it takes up a larger slice of your resources than you anticipated.
virgo,There may be times today when you feel out of your depth intellectually but don’t let it discourage you. Others may be more knowledgeable but they lack your intensity, your passion, your drive to get things done. You’ve still got the edge.
virgo,Don’t be afraid to push a little bit harder than usual and don’t hesitate to demand a little bit more from those you live, work and do business with. If you give your all there is no reason why others should not to do the same.
virgo,Don’t feel hard done by if you have to postpone something you were looking forward to. Come the end of the week you will be glad you were forced to make changes. Trust that fate in its wisdom knows what is good for you. ,virgo,Don’t be surprised if someone you are close to emotionally says something less than flattering about you today. Before you break down in tears find out why they are making a big thing of your failings. There must be a reason for it. ,virgo,No one has betrayed you and no one is out to get you, so why have you fallen prey to so many worries and fears? Tell yourself that it’s all an illusion, that your mind is playing tricks on you. It’s not a million miles from the truth.
virgo,You will need to show your ruthless side over the next few days, especially on the work front where, if you don’t deal with rivals quickly, they might just make your life a misery. Don’t feel sorry for them – it’s them or you.
virgo,Money matters may have dominated in recent weeks but now you are a bit more relaxed and can focus on your social life. The coming week will bring someone new into your life, someone with whom you will have a lot of fun.
virgo,You are no stranger to speaking your mind but the planets indicate it might be better to say nothing at all today. Certainly don’t brag about how good you are at certain things. It might encourage a rival to try to prove you wrong.
virgo,Details, details, you really do love details. And that’s okay because with Mars changing signs today you will do best if you focus on mundane activities. The more attention you pay to little things the more big things will go well for you. ,virgo,You may find it difficult to get along with co-workers today but that’s okay. If you are not one hundred per cent sure that they are doing the right thing then by all means keep your distance. Self-preservation is the name of the game.
virgo,You would be wise not to take everything you hear today or over the weekend at face value because the approaching full moon warns that some people will try to confuse you. Just because the news is exciting does not mean it is true.
virgo,You will find it much easier to be positive about what is going on in your life now that Venus is moving through the most dynamic area of your chart. Always look on the bright side and never, ever be afraid to take risks.
virgo,It may be tempting to dwell on something small this week but it’s the bigger picture you should be trying to bring into focus. Life is like one of those clever patterns you have to look at in a certain way to see the hidden picture. Try squinting. ,virgo,Don’t waste time yearning for what you cannot possess because it also makes it harder to get what is in your power to acquire. Focus on the possible and be happy with that. You can’t have what you want but you can want what you have.
virgo,With Mercury, your ruler, linked to Mars, planet of energy, you will work twice as fast and achieve twice as much as your rivals. This is a great day to be competitive, especially at work, but keep it friendly too. You don’t have to make enemies.
virgo,If certain people have been less than helpful of late don’t make a big deal of it. Life moves in cycles and their attitude will most likely swing from one extreme to the other over the next few days. They will want to do everything for you. ,virgo,Put your energy to good use today by travelling and socializing and generally being on the move. Don’t sit at home waiting for something interesting to come your way, go out and find it for yourself. This is also a good time to start a new hobby.
virgo,Do something creative today, something that shows off your artistic side. If you make a good impression now you could be made the kind of offer you won’t want to refuse before the end of the year. Be dynamic and make people take notice.
virgo,Love planet Venus links with Neptune in the partnership area of your chart this weekend, making it easy for you to be frank about your feelings. It does not matter how big a relationship problem may be you can resolve it if you try. So try. ,virgo,You may be rather emotional over the next few days, which could cause problems if you allow feelings to override facts. On the other hand this is an excellent time for relationship matters. Your depth of understanding now makes compromise possible.
virgo,Give those you love your undivided attention as the new week begins. No matter how many interesting things may be taking place around you it is the needs and desires of loved ones which matter. There has never been a better time to show you care.
virgo,You are worrying about things that most likely will never happen. The only way to break out of this mindset is to do something that requires your full attention so you have no time to torment yourself with vague feelings of doom and gloom.
virgo,If you want to succeed, personally or professionally, you need to make an effort and go out and look for success rather than wait for it to come to you. Put yourself in situations where you can be seen by the people you want to impress. ,virgo,The Sun in the domestic area of your chart will help you express yourself emotionally and make it easier for partners and loved ones to let you know how they feel as well. Things can only get better on the home front, so cheer up.
virgo,You are in a go-getting frame of mind at the moment and that’s good because if you make a serious effort the results will astound you. You can quite easily create something that proves popular with the public – and makes you a fortune. ,virgo,It does not matter what challenges you face this weekend you will overcome them all with ease. Your main problem at the moment seems to be that you are reading a bit too much into situations that are really quite simple. Try thinking less! ,virgo,You will learn a lot about someone over the coming week, maybe more than you feel comfortable with, What you need to remember is that everyone is different and has different needs and desires. Maybe you should be a bit more adventurous too.
virgo,You will get the chance to heal rifts and end feuds over the next few days. If family issues are causing problems now is the time to sit everyone down and discuss what has gone wrong and what needs to be done to make it right again.
virgo,Because today’s new moon falls in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart you must not let your emotions get the better of you. Other people’s indecision may rub you up the wrong way but if you feign indifference you’ll be okay. ,virgo,What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so forget about the past and start thinking about what could be achieved if you get your act together and make some positive moves. Learn what you can from what’s gone before – then move on. ,virgo,You feel more enthusiastic about what you have to do and you feel stronger, physically and mentally, than you have for a long time. This is an excellent time to start a new fitness regime. Make it something that really tests you. ,virgo,If you have been too busy of late to remind certain people how much they mean to you then make the effort this weekend. Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart will make it easy to find words that really mean something. ,virgo,If you need help then ask for it. It may annoy you that you cannot solve a problem on your own but even a Virgo has days when the old brain matter seems to switch off. No one will think any the less of you if you request assistance. ,virgo,Don’t get frustrated if you are unable to push ahead with a project that means a lot to you, because what happens between now and the turn of the year will give you new targets to aim for and new mountains to climb. You’re still moving up.
virgo,You must deliver on what you promised, because if you fail to come up with the goods your reputation will head south in no time. Also, don’t let your imaginings carry you away. If your head is in the air, keep your feet on the ground.
virgo,The danger today is that you will do too much and exhaust yourself. Yes, you need to step up a gear, but you must do it in stages rather than all in one go. Think of your health, not only your physical health but your mental health too.
virgo,You never like having to turn people away but according to the planets that is exactly what you must do today – unless you want to work yourself into the ground. Whatever you might think you owe other people, you owe more to yourself.
virgo,Good news on the money front will lift your spirits and make you realize that so many of the things you have been worrying about in recent weeks are just not worth the effort. Your only obligation now is to go out into the world and have fun.
virgo,A little bit of thought will take you a long way this weekend, especially on the home front where if you make an effort to see things from both sides you will find it quite easy to defuse a potentially explosive situation. Remember, others have opinions too.
virgo,You may feel tied down by your obligations, at home and at work, but hang in there and don’t lose heart. Above all, don’t give others the impression that you would rather be somewhere else, or they may pile even more work on your shoulders.
virgo,Honesty is the best policy today, especially on the home front where you need to let loved ones know that you find some of their actions troubling. Don’t worry that you might hurt their feelings – they are not nearly as sensitive as you fear.
libra,There may be a number of minor setbacks over the next few days but you will handle them with ease and still find time to have fun. The most important thing is that you are on the move – you’ll miss out if you sit still.
libra,The more you search for a solution to a problem of some kind the more it seems to elude you. Maybe you are trying too hard. Maybe you should focus on something else for a while. The answer will come when it’s ready. ,libra,Your energy may be high at the moment but don’t burn yourself out. Social invitations will come thick and fast over the next few days but you are under no obligation to go along to them all, or even any of them.
libra,Use your head today, especially when dealing with people who tend to get emotional over what are really quite trivial matters. No matter how agitated they may get you should remain calm and stay focused on the facts.
libra,Get a change of scene today. The more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet people who bring a smile to your face – and what could be more important than that? Look for similarities with others, not differences.
libra,It’s not like you to look back and wish things had been different but that may be your attitude today. Okay, so you could have done a lot of things differently and some things better but that’s life. Only ever look forwards.
libra,As Mars moves into your birth sign today you will find it so much easier to be assertive. Not everyone will agree with your aims but, to be blunt, you couldn’t care less. Only one person’s views count with you – your own!,libra,What others say and do may influence your thinking but it is still your responsibility to make sure things work out the right way. Above all this week you must not allow rivals to blame you for their own feeble failings. ,libra,Make a point of respecting other people’s right to have opinions you don’t agree with. If you must criticize what they say at least do so in a civilized fashion. Resist the urge to be sarcastic because that will make the situation ten times worse.
libra,Can you trust your senses? Most of the time maybe but today you would be wise to question what your eyes and ears tell you. Are you seeing and hearing what’s really there or what certain people want you to believe is there?,libra,According to the planets this is a good day for personal issues, especially partnerships. Where affairs of the heart are concerned you can hardly put a foot wrong at the moment – and a little of what you fancy will do you good.
libra,At some stage today you will realize that you are not going to get far with a joint project of some kind, thanks mainly to people dragging their feet. You will though make progress in areas where you can work on your own.
libra,Don’t over-extend yourself on the work front or you may find that your energy takes a nose-dive early next week. Today’s Jupiter-Saturn link will help you persuade others to do things for you. You don’t have to do it all on your own,libra,You may think you are determined and driven to succeed but with Mars in your sign you can and you must push yourself twice as hard as you usually do. Personally and professionally all things are possible, starting this very weekend.
libra,If you cut corners or disobey rules this week you are sure to regret it. Even if you are the sort of Libra who enjoys taking risks you are strongly advised to play it safe. Don’t give your enemies an opening to make you look bad.
libra,You will get your way on the work front easily enough today but you may upset a few people along the way. That won’t worry you in the slightest. You are determined to make your mark and make some serious money too.
libra,You can be extremely persuasive at times but don’t go too far and demand that people change their views and opinions. Communication is about the exchange of ideas, not forcing your ideas on those who clearly don’t want them.
libra,At some stage today your frustration is likely to bubble over and you will say or do something that you later regret. But, even so, it’s good to remind those around you that your patience is finite. It keeps them on their toes.
libra,What happens over the next few days will help you to understand that your priorities are wrong, that you are worrying about the things you cannot change while neglecting the things you can. It’s time to get your head back together. ,libra,You may be tempted to do something drastic today but the planets warn the results are as likely to be negative as positive. Why not just wait a while and let the current situation work itself out? There’s no need to rush.
libra,It’s okay to be cautious when dealing with people you don’t know very well but don’t let it get to a level where you distrust every word they say for no good reason. Most people, even strangers, are still honest in their dealings.
libra,You always have plenty to say for yourself but for a while at least it might be wise to button your lip and listen to what others have to say. You could learn something to your advantage this week, if you are willing to use your ears.
libra,You are beginning to realize that you have placed your trust in someone who is playing a different game completely, one which they alone are guaranteed to win. Now you have rumbled them you can and you must turn the tables.
libra,Partners and colleagues will demand more of your time and attention today and if you are smart you will give it to them. If you do small favors for others now chances are they will do big favors for you later on. That’s how it works.
libra,What you need to remember now is that brains will beat brawn every time. No matter how powerful or how well connected an opponent may be you can get the better of them, simply by using your superior intellect.
libra,If you have been taking a loved one for granted of late this could be a tricky day. Somehow you need to convince them that your feelings are still the same but it will take more than just words. You may have to get romantic!,libra,There is someone in your world you need to pay more attention to. This person has always been important to you but maybe they have not always received the love and respect they deserve. Make them feel like a million dollars today.
libra,The planets indicate that some kind of breakthrough is imminent, so keep believing that you will succeed and keep believing that the rewards will be huge. Both in your personal life and at work the sky is the limit – so soar.
libra,You may be a bit sensitive at the moment but that’s okay because, if anything, you have not been sensitive enough in recent weeks and need to redress the balance. Some people seem to think you lack empathy. Make it your aim to prove them wrong.
libra,Others may frown at your behavior today but only because they are jealous that you are enjoying yourself so much. Should you feel sorry for them? No you should not. But you can be a good example and show them how easy it is to have fun.
libra,The only danger now is that you may overestimate your own strength while underestimating what rivals are capable of — and that’s a recipe for disaster. Remember, too, that some people are naturally stubborn — they won’t be moved. ,libra,Resist the urge to show any kind of favoritism today, especially on the home front where you could upset a loved one if they think you are doing more for others than you are for them. It may not be true but that’s the way they will see it.
libra,Even if you are one of those rare Librans who prefer to keep their thoughts private, you will have plenty to say for yourself today. The only danger is you may say too much and reveal valuable information. Keep good ideas to yourself.
libra,If you believe that something bad is going to happen, then most likely it will. When negative thoughts get a hold on your mind you create subconscious ripples that attract downbeat people and harmful events. Get a grip on yourself.
libra,Try to be more understanding of someone who has let you down or in some other way incurred your displeasure. No doubt they deserve to be treated roughly but, on this occasion, they will respond better to encouragement than to criticism.
libra,You may think that you can do as you please and get away with it but the planets warn if you go too far today you could create a backlash that is difficult to contain. Maybe you should play it safe, just this once.
libra,It will pay you to be secretive, especially if you are working on a plan that requires the element of surprise to succeed. If people start sniffing around, asking what you are up to, tell them anything but the truth. Yes, you may have to lie. ,libra,This is an important time for you and you will be making at least one and maybe several major changes to your lifestyle. The full moon on the 16th will clear away obstacles. Between now and then make your plans and make them big.
libra,All things are possible – you feel in your bones that you can take on the world and win – and you’re right, you can. But why make a battle of it when you have the charm to get what you want without a struggle? Or is that what you enjoy?,libra,It is important that you make an effort to put squabbles behind you. That might seem like a tall order considering how fragile certain relationships have been of late but it will be easier than you imagine, so imagine it and do it.
libra,Stay true to your principles and don’t stoop to underhand methods or tactics, no matter how great the prize. If you lower your standards even a little you will lessen the morality gap that exists between you and most other people.
libra,The best way to deal with criticism is to ignore it. Focus your mind on your work over the next seven days and give the critics a miss. Most likely they are talking rubbish as usual – some people, it seems, just can’t help themselves.
libra,You may feel sorry for someone whose luck appears to have deserted them but you are still advised to keep your distance and not get personally involved. Most likely the universe is trying to teach them something. Don’t get in the way.
libra,You will hear something today that does not exactly fill you with joyous feelings but it’s not as bad as you think it is. It may even, in a strange sort of way, be the forerunner of good news over the longer term, so don’t despair just yet.
libra,Are you in charge of your emotions, or are your emotions in charge of you? That is the question you need to ask of yourself and, if you are honest, it will most likely be the latter. Whatever else happens, don’t let your fears damage your career.
libra,Someone who envies your calm demeanor will turn up the heat today in the hope that you will start to sweat, but what they don’t know is that you thrive on this sort of pressure. Not even today’s full moon can crack your composure.
libra,There are plenty of challenges in your life at the moment but you don’t have to make an issue of every one of them. You will progress quicker if you pick your battles carefully and ignore whatever does not take you closer to your goals.
libra,You have been rather emotional of late, no doubt due to the Sun’s transit of one of the more sensitive areas of your chart. As from Monday though your world will be a much brighter and much happier place – so dry your eyes!,libra,Not only is Mars positioned nicely in your birth sign but the Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart as well this week. It matters not if the world is against you: there is just no way you are going to lose.
libra,If there is something of an artistic nature you have been thinking of trying now is the time to stop thinking and start doing. With the Sun moving into the most dynamic area of your chart you can and you will make a name for yourself.
libra,This is no time for doubts or second thoughts. Throw caution to the wind and let your instincts guide you. This is a great time for creative activities and affairs of the heart, so be creative about your love life and love everything you create.
libra,First appearances can be deceptive, so don’t be put off if someone you meet today seems a bit too serious for your tastes. The planets suggest the two of you will be working with each other a lot, so do what you can to put them at ease.
libra,The Sun in Aquarius does wonders for your confidence, so it’s unlikely you will stop to think before you speak or tone down your remarks to save other people’s blushes. And why should you? It’s not your fault the truth is painful.
libra,No matter how many brilliant ideas you have buzzing round your brain they don’t mean a thing unless you do something with them. For too long you have been coming up with grand plans but not going any further. Now it’s time to act.
libra,You may not be under quite so much pressure on the work front now but don’t use that as an excuse to lower your standards or not try so hard. Important people are still watching you, so make sure they like what they see.
libra,The combination of a new moon in the most dynamic area of your solar chart and an inspiring Sun-Uranus link means that obstacles are few and opportunities are limitless. You are at a peak right now, so go find a mountain to climb.
libra,You have been avoiding taking some kind of decision but the time is rapidly approaching when you must act swiftly. You know what has to be done and you know the importance of getting it right, so quit stalling and get busy.
libra,Someone in a position of authority will look on you kindly today. What have you done to deserve their support? Who knows, but you would be a fool not to make the most of it. There’s nothing wrong with being flavor of the month.
libra,Relationships of the romantic kind are well starred today. Let the object of your affection know that they are, always have been and always will be number one in your heart. If you do that, the next few days will be extra special.
libra,You can sense that something marvelous is going to happen over the next 24 hours but you don’t know what it is. That’s part of the fun. Whatever it happens to be, make the most of it. Marvelous things rarely stay marvelous for long.
libra,It will pay you to come on a little less strong today, especially at work but also at home. You don’t need to prove yourself. You don’t need to impress the powers that be. In fact you will impress people more if you switch off and have fun.
libra,Everyone seems to be on a totally different wavelength to you at the moment, so you can’t expect much support, not even from friends and family members. You don’t care in the least. You don’t need their support. You can cope on your own.
libra,You may have to cuts corners and bend rules to get things done over the next 24 hours but it will be worth it. If will certainly save you time, much of which will be taken up trying to explain to others what you are doing and why.
libra,Anyone who thinks you are not ambitious will get a shock today as you push yourself harder than ever. But while it is okay to be hard on yourself it is not okay to be hard on friends, loved ones and relatives. Stay balanced. Stay calm.
libra,Something you hear on the work front could benefit you enormously, but only if you have the presence of mind to act quickly. You are not the only one who is looking for a way to get ahead, so stay alert and be decisive and dynamic. ,libra,There is sure to be some kind of disorder today, most likely on the work front where your colleagues may discover that they are not up to keeping the promises they made. You, of course, could see it coming, so you won’t be fazed in the slightest.
libra,Put the finishing touches to something of a creative nature, something that could bring you the kind of recognition and rewards you believe you deserve. Even if it doesn’t make you rich and famous it will still be a job well done.
libra,The problems you are having with a new working routine are minor and likely to be short-lived, so don’t let them annoy you. And don’t let other people tell you that you need to change course. They don’t know what they are talking about.
libra,Mars in your sign makes you confident and assertive but you are still advised to start the week slowly and carefully. Feel your way and don’t take too many risks. Save yourself for next weekend when you’ll be a winner in everything you do.
libra,There is no point arguing with people who will always see things differently to you. It takes all sorts to make a world and though that does not mean you have to like them it does sometimes mean you have to put up with them. ,libra,You have been chopping and changing far too much of late. According to the planets you must choose a route and stick with it today. If you don’t it may be several more weeks before you get the chance to regain control of your affairs.
libra,Be careful what you say over the next few days because certain people won’t take kindly to you making light of things that they take seriously. Others, however, will think you are the funniest Libra ever. Choose your audience carefully.
libra,It may be annoying that someone is dragging their feet and generally making life hard for you but don’t make an issue of it. The full moon means you just have to accept that not everyone thinks or moves or acts as fast as you.
libra,You know what you want, you know where to get it and with Mars, planet of energy and ambition, on good form this weekend there is no doubt at all you will soon reach your goal. There’s just no stopping you at the moment.
libra,Are the good times about to end? Will you have to pay for the easy ride you’ve had in recent weeks? No, of course not, but as from tomorrow you may have to make more of an effort to get what takes no effort at all today.
libra,If you find that you are lacking in energy today resist the urge to push yourself even harder. Now that the Sun is moving through the wellbeing area of your chart you must pace yourself sensibly. Get the balance right between work and rest.
libra,You might prefer to be honest but you will have to tell a little white lie today, the kind that keeps a friend from getting into serious trouble. A few days from now, when they realize what you did, they will thank you profusely. ,libra,Stop worrying about all the little things that may or may not be going wrong and concentrate on the one big thing you would most like to go right. If you focus your mind power in a single direction you might just create some sort of miracle.
libra,The next 24 hours may be a bit bumpier than usual but that’s okay because you are not the sort to panic. You are, however, the sort to go out and spend money to make yourself feel better and that could be a huge mistake.
libra,If you have been finding it hard to reach agreement over a business issue you should be able to break the deadlock this weekend. But make sure you get everything written down and signed. You can be too trusting at times.
libra,It’s time to stop acting like an amateur and get started on something of a serious nature. Cosmic activity in the work and wellbeing area of your chart makes this the perfect time to start a new project or begin a new fitness regime. Get to it!,libra,Travel and social plans may have to be changed today as the planets bring to light information that casts doubt on other people’s motives. If you don’t feel 100 per cent sure they are on the level then maybe you should stay at home.
libra,Take care you don’t get too close to a situation and lose your sense of perspective. You need to make a conscious decision to stand back from what you are doing and see the bigger picture – it’s always there for you if you know how to look.
libra,It would be nice if you could solve all the problems of the world but be realistic: you can’t even come close. What you can do though is join with those who share your views and aim to change one specific thing for the better. Get to it.
libra,Do something unexpected. Be as outrageous as you please. The planets indicate that no matter how far you push the limits, at home or at work, others will forgive you. But that’s only today. As from tomorrow they won’t be so generous.
libra,News you receive from afar will cheer you no end and also make you realize that what you have been worrying about in recent weeks is of no real importance. Creatively and romantically you must seize the initiative and make things happen.
libra,Usually you look at the big picture and don’t worry too much about details, but lately you have become obsessed by minor issues. The good news is that this weekend’s new moon will sweep away your fears, and your mania for trivia.
libra,Make doing things for other people your priority this week. What you do for loved ones and friends now will be done for you at some stage in the future. You don’t have to make major sacrifices – just do what you can to help those in need.
libra,You won’t stop moving and you won’t stop talking and you won’t stop impressing people with your ideas. Both at home and at work others will look up to you as the one person they can trust to see things as they really are.
libra,Anyone who disagrees with your right to dictate terms will be out in the cold before they know what is happening. Most of the time you are quite happy-go-lucky but today the happiest and luckiest people will be those who stay out of your way!,libra,Too often in the past you have lacked the confidence to follow through on a good idea and make a name for yourself. Now though you will look and act as if you just can’t fail. And you won’t. In fact you will make it look easy.
libra,Your way with words will win round even the most reluctant of partners and co-workers today. Create a vision of what it is you intend to achieve and let them see that they can share in the spoils – but they have got to back you NOW.
libra,You have a tendency to fear the worst but with Jupiter moving in your favor again your mood will lighten and you will be visualizing all sorts of wonderful things. That’s good. What’s in your mind’s eye today will be your reality tomorrow.
libra,You may not think you are qualified for a certain job or position but that doesn’t matter. The only thing that counts is that you possess the courage and the confidence to turn your hand to something new. You’ll learn as you go along.
libra,Your sixth sense tells you that something unexpected is about to happen, but that is no reason to lock the doors and pull down the blinds. You know the old saying: If you’ve done nothing wrong you’ve got nothing to be scared of.
libra,You will make an impression over the next seven days but will it be of the right sort? That depends on how well you get along with the people you work with and for. Be confident but try not to be arrogant or domineering.
libra,The past few weeks have been tough and the next 24 hours is likely to bring challenges too, but nothing will happen that you don’t have the intelligence and the courage to overcome. You’re at your best with your back to the wall.
libra,A plan or project that has been in a state of limbo since the start of the year will begin to move forward again as from today. Don’t try to do everything at once though. You’ll catch up eventually, so be smart and start slow.
libra,Your sixth sense tells you that something drastic is going to happen, but that does not mean you should shut yourself away until it is over. In fact, what some people see as a disaster over the next 24 hours you will see as a golden opportunity.
libra,If you feel the need to brag about your success then go right ahead. It’s not often you make a big noise about how well you have done, so every once in a while it’s okay. You certainly have lots to be proud of. Let everyone know.
libra,You must put your own interests first this weekend, because if you allow others to persuade you that their needs are more important you will lose out in a big way. It won’t hurt to be a bit more suspicious than usual. ,libra,Don’t let your disappointment over one little thing ruin what should be a glorious week. Also, don’t think it is wrong to be happy when there are so many people who are unhappy. Do you want to change the world? Then make it laugh.
libra,You will change your mind about something today that you seemed so sure about yesterday. Not everyone will be happy about it but that’s not your concern. What matters is that new experiences have widened and deepened your awareness.
libra,Venus, your ruler, links nicely with changes planet Uranus over the next 24 hours, which means you must be more adventurous. Both creatively and romantically you should take more chances than usual and believe that you deserve to succeed.
libra,As the Sun is about to move into the relationship area of your chart you should make more of an effort to get along with the people around you, even those you don’t much like. Use your famous Libra charm to win them round.
libra,There is no point trying to keep your plans to yourself because friends and family and work colleagues will find out about them sooner or later. Have you got something to hide? Of course not, so let them know what you are up to.
libra,Watch what you say and the way in which you say it. The planets warn if you shoot your mouth off today you may provoke someone who knows how to hit back. And they will hit you where it hurts most – in your wallet!,libra,You will find it easier to socialize and have fun this weekend. Your problems, such as they are, may still be there and you will certainly have to deal with them at some stage, but for now you must put them out of your mind.
libra,If you don’t seem to be getting any closer to your goals then you may have to do something drastic about it. Think big, speak big and act big this week. Give others the impression that you alone can make things happen.
libra,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Aries is trying to warn you that, where your feelings are concerned, you could be easily misled. Others may try to manipulate you but that does not mean you have to make it easy for them.
libra,Mars in your sign endows you with huge amounts of energy. However, as Mars is going through one of its retrograde phases you must be careful about how you use that energy. For best results, don’t make changes that cannot be changed back.
libra,Self-confidence is the key to success, so believe in what you are doing and believe that sooner or later your efforts will be rewarded. Remember too that the world you experience “out there” is largely a reflection of what goes on inside your head.
libra,You will hear something to your benefit today but your suspicious nature could hold you back from taking advantage of it. Unless there is clear evidence that someone is trying to trick you then you must take a chance. If you don’t, you’ll regret it.
libra,You will know immediately if someone is lying to you today – there is just no way they can pull the wool over your eyes. Whether or not you let them know you are not fooled is up to you. It may benefit you to play dumb.
libra,This is a great weekend for relationships. You will get along easily with partners and loved ones and friends, no matter how many bad times you may have been through of late. You have too much in common to be angry for long.
libra,If you let the wrong person know what you are thinking this week you could find yourself in an embarrassing situation. Try to realize that not everyone shares your offbeat way of looking at the world – or your more outrageous desires! ,libra,You would be wise to let friends and work colleagues express their opinions today, even if they clash with your own. At some stage in the very near future you are going to need their assistance, so try not to turn them against you.

libra,For some strange reason you can’t get started on a project you have been planning for some time. Maybe the universe is trying to tell you something. Maybe it isn’t quite the right time to begin. What’s the rush? It can wait.
libra,Make a conscious effort to be nice to people, even if they don’t deserve it. The planets warn you are going to need help before the end of the week and you are more likely to get it if others feel obligated to you in some way.
libra,Where before there were so many misunderstandings there will now be an awareness of how much certain people mean to you and why minor differences of opinion are of no importance at all. Be friends with everyone, but most of all with yourself.
libra,Creative endeavors are under excellent stars, so if there is some kind of artistic project you want to get started on don’t wait any longer. Remember too that there is no such thing as the perfect time – the present moment is all you ever have.
libra,Whatever happens today, be it good, bad or indifferent, try not to take it too seriously. Others may think it’s the end of the world, or the start of a golden age, but you know it’s nowhere near as dramatic as that. It’s life, that’s all.
libra,Make sure you know what you are talking about today, especially if you are dealing with people who are experts of some sort. If you make claims that cannot be backed up with facts they won’t hesitate to make you look silly.
libra,If you say something you know to be untrue today the planets warn you will be found out, much to your embarrassment. There is absolutely no reason why you should lie or give false information. What could be so bad about the truth?,libra,Everything that is meant to happen will happen when the time is right, so stop worrying that you should be doing more. According to the planets you are exactly where you should be, so forget about tomorrow and live in the moment.
libra,Make the effort to do what other people want you to do this week, even though your heart may not be in it. A week from now it may be you who needs their help and you are more likely to get it if they feel they owe you.
libra,Disruption of one sort or another is inevitable today. Whatever happens, keep telling yourself that it’s not as bad as it seems and promise yourself that you will keep your emotions in check. And by all means laugh at those who get hysterical.
libra,Today’s lunar eclipse in your sign is sure to confuse things and make you more emotional than usual, so promise yourself now that no matter what happens you won’t get upset about it. In a matter of days it will all be forgotten.
libra,Partners and colleagues have the upper hand at the moment and you need to accept that fact. There are powers in the world that cannot be beaten by either charm or force of personality, of which you have plenty. Stay calm and let things just happen.
libra,It may be time to let certain people know that they can have no say in your future. Far too many friends and relatives seem to be telling you what you should do but each and every one of them is wrong. Follow your heart – it knows the way.
libra,You may have certain duties to fulfill but you don’t have to be a slave to other people’s demands. Make sure everyone – friends, family and work colleagues alike – know that what you do for them you do out of the goodness of your heart.
libra,Business issues and money matters will take on added importance this weekend. Make sure anything to do with property and investments is handled with care over the next few days, and over the next few weeks. There’s a lot at stake.
libra,Try not to lose your sense of perspective this week or common sense could go right out of the window, with disastrous results. It may seem as if everyone but you is riding the gravy train and cashing in but it’s not all about money you know.
libra,You won’t care in the slightest whose toes you may be treading on today, you will wade in where angels fear to tread and put the world to rights. Or maybe you’ll make it even worse than before – but you WILL make an impression!,libra,It’s one thing to make bold decisions but it’s another to make sure they are the right decisions. There is a great deal at stake at the moment and if you call it wrong the repercussions could be massive, so think deeply and act cautiously.
libra,Whatever it is that you fear you need to put a name to it because only then will you be able to face it and conquer it. Most likely you have been worrying for no good reason but even if your anxieties are valid they don’t have to be such a big deal.
libra,Make sure what you wish for is what you truly desire because once it is in your possession you may not be able to give it back again. Also, be careful when making promises to friends. They will hold you to them come what may.
libra,No matter how determined you may be to make a good impression on people in positions of power you must not run yourself into the ground. Make sure the delicate equilibrium between your mind, body and emotions is not disturbed.
libra,Have a clear out this weekend. Get rid of not just all the material junk you have accumulated but all the emotional junk too. But make sure you only get rid of those things that are negative – some things are still worth keeping.
libra,Money matters of all kinds are under favorable influences at the moment and if you think sensibly and act wisely your financial position is sure to improve. Think about the future too: how can you invest now to get more later on?,libra,According to the planets you are carrying too much emotional baggage and need to give your feelings a thorough spring clean. Once you have confronted your fears you may well realize there was precious little to worry about in the first place.
libra,There is no point arguing with people who simply refuse to see sense. It may be tempting to show them up with your superior knowledge but why bother? Eventually they will see just how foolish they have been but don’t waste your time on them.
libra,You must not take any unnecessary risks today, especially with money. Keep your cash in your pocket and don’t let anyone, no matter how smooth-talking, persuade you there is easy money to be made, because it’s your money they are after.
libra,Mars in your sign endows you with courage and confidence but other aspects warn you can’t do it all on your own. You need to rediscover the joys of being a team player, of how good it feels to share success with other people.
libra,You may have to wait a few weeks before you get the chance to put your big idea into effect but don’t be impatient. The more time you give it to percolate through your brain the more likely it is to be an outstanding success.
libra,You will need plenty of self-belief over the next few days. Not only are major changes coming your way but you will come under intense pressure to conform in your reaction to them. Don’t do it. Be free and follow your conscience.
libra,What you have to do over the next few days may not be what you would choose to do but if you approach it in the right frame of mind it can still be fun. More significantly, it will get important people back on your side.
libra,Don’t try to force others to do your bidding today because they will make such an emotional scene that even you will be embarrassed. If there is something that needs doing either do it yourself or hire someone to do it for you.
libra,You may have been a bit too fixed in your opinions of late but with mind planet Mercury moving in your favor again you will get the chance to review your beliefs and adjust them to fit reality – rather than the other way round!,libra,Whatever else you do over the next 24 hours don’t cut corners or break rules, because you won’t get away with it. Resist the temptation to do anything dishonest, not just because it is dishonest but also because you really don’t need to.
libra,You should expect a certain amount of deception over the next 24 hours, even from people you think you can trust. Don’t take anything that happens too seriously and don’t hold grudges against people who let you down. It happens.
libra,You need to get serious about a money matter or business issue you have been neglecting of late. You may also have to get tough with people who have not being playing straight with you – even to the point of ending a relationship.
libra,You will be in a generous mood over the next few days, especially with those who have been generous to you in the past. But don’t limit your kindness to people you know personally do something of a charitable nature for strangers too.
libra,Some things may seem funny to you but not everyone will laugh at your jokes today. Most likely it’s because they resent you being the center of attention all the time. That’s too bad – the limelight is there to be hogged.
libra,Fears you thought had been put behind you will return in strange and unexpected ways. However, if you face up to those fears and deal with them bravely the planets indicate this will be the very last time they bother you.
libra,If you let your emotions influence what should be a purely logical decision today you could end up out of pocket. Where money and other material matters are concerned you must not take risks, not even if the potential rewards are great.
libra,Let the people you feel closest to know how much you need them and appreciate them and love them. It’s not true that Librans lack emotion and anyone who thinks that will have no choice but to think again over the next 24 hours.
libra,At some point today you will realize that so many of the things you have been worrying about are simply not worth the time or the effort. Once you understand that you will find it easier to focus on what is genuinely important.
libra,Nothing will worry you and nothing will put you off what you are planning to do. You instinctively know this is the time to take action, while the Sun is still moving in your favor. You’ve got to be quick though – do something today.
libra,No doubt you can’t wait to get to work on your plans but don’t be so eager that you make a false start. You have plenty of time to make your mark, so see to it that the foundations are strong. Take it a step at a time.
libra,You like to talk and it is something you are good at but the planets warn it might be better if you said nothing at all today. If are the kind of Libra who likes to chat for the sake of it you could give away too much information.
libra,You should know by now that change is the only constant in life and the really good news is that the changes coming your way over the next few days will delight you. One of the best times of the year is about to begin.
libra,There will be an obvious change in your mood over the next two or three days. Where before you were highly strung and often uptight now you will be relaxed and easygoing. Don’t take life too seriously. Having fun is what matters.
libra,You will be on inspired form over the next few days. Every idea you have – and you will have plenty – will be touched by genius in some way. Remember though that ideas mean nothing unless you do something with them.
libra,One of the best times of the year for you is now under way, so get rid of any negative attitudes you may have and start looking forward to all the good things that will be coming your way. Be positive in thought, word and deed.
libra,Go out and have a good time this weekend. You have had so many serious things to deal with of late that you seem to have forgotten what it means to have fun but it won’t take much to remind yourself – it’s what you do best after all.
libra,The Sun in Gemini will encourage you to take the kind of risks you usually tend to avoid and Wednesday’s new moon will bring the perfect opportunity to expand your horizons and be more adventurous. What have you got to lose?,libra,A lot of things that have been hidden from you in recent weeks and months will be revealed over the next few days. Try not to dwell on the many little things that make up your life – it’s the big picture that matters now.
libra,It will feel as if a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders today. Money worries, especially, will begin to fade and you can start having fun again without constantly having to check how much cash you’ve got in your purse.
libra,You have a lot to say for yourself and most of it is worth listening to, but be careful you don’t say anything that might upset people whose support you are going to need. It’s good to have opinions but not so good if they cause you trouble.
libra,If there has been some sort of dispute or disagreement now is the time to patch things up. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to business issues. There is always a solution – it’s simply a question of how hard to choose to look.
libra,Mars in your sign makes life more adventurous and exciting. Wherever you go and whatever you do today you must seize the initiative and make sure the world knows you are a force to be reckoned with – a force of nature in fact.
libra,Mars in your sign makes you assertive and ambitious and today’s link with the Sun in Gemini means everyone is on your side too. There has rarely been a better time to push yourself forward and take what it is you desire.
libra,You may think you can get away with outrageous behavior, and maybe you are right, but that does not mean you have to behave in ways that are guaranteed to annoy certain people. Keep your excesses at a reasonable level this week.
libra,This is still one of the best times of the year for you but that does not mean you can do as you please. The planets warn you may need to take extra care today and tomorrow when dealing with travel plans and social arrangements.
libra,Your confidence may be high now the Sun is transiting the sympathetic sign of Gemini but don’t get carried away. Other aspects warn there are things going on behind the scenes that suggest you could be in for a shock.
libra,You need to get out of the habit of trying to do everything alone. It will pay you to be a little less independent over the next few days. Just because you don’t like certain people does not mean you can’t work with them.
libra,You are in an adventurous mood but the planets warn this may not be the best time to venture into areas you don’t know much about. Wait until the full moon on the 13th has come and gone before moving outside your comfort zone.
libra,The slightest little thing is likely to set you off today but on this occasion getting angry is actually the best thing you could do. It will certainly remind others that you are not the sort of person who can be taken for granted.
libra,Don’t cling to things, be they people or possessions, that need to pass out of your life. Not only do you no longer need them but the longer you hold on the longer it will be before better things are able to come into your life.
libra,Be careful what you say this week, because careless words could have a negative impact on your image. That may not worry you now but it will later on when you are overlooked for a promotion or a pay increase. Say nice things only.
libra,Where money matters are concerned you would be wise not to take risks because most likely the odds are stacked against you. A hunch might pay off but more likely it will put you in a situation where one loss leads to another.
libra,A positive attitude is essential over the next 24 hours because if you let even one negative thought creep into your mind it’s likely to get stuck there. Life is good and getting better by the moment – believe it, it’s true.
libra,Don’t pay too much attention to material things today. What matters is not how much money you earn or what amazing possessions you own but how happy you are on the inside. Bank accounts are one thing – spiritual accounts quite another.
libra,You are attaching too much importance to issues that only a few days ago would have meant nothing to you at all. Why that should be is impossible to say but you need to ease up a bit. In the greater scheme of things, what do they matter?,libra,You seem a bit excitable at the moment but that’s okay – most likely nothing bad will come of it. In fact this looks like being a good time for you, especially if you are traveling or planning a vacation for later in the year.
libra,You seem remarkably passionate about something that a while ago would not have interested you in the slightest. It may be just a passing fad but it could also be the start of a brand new chapter in your life. If it inspires you, go for it.
libra,You need to let certain individuals know that you and you alone will decide the course of your future. Far too many people seem to want a say in your affairs at the moment. Tell each and every one of them to mind their own business!,libra,Make the most of the Sun’s last few days in your fellow Air sign of Gemini to do the things you really enjoy. When the Sun changes signs on the 21st you will find yourself snowed under with new responsibilities. Have fun while you can.
libra,You are worrying about something that most other times would not bother you in the slightest – thanks to Mercury, planet of the mind, going through one of its negative phases. Snap out of it. Life is good and getting better by the moment.
libra,Be generous with your time and, maybe, with your money too. You don’t have to give away all your worldly goods but the planets indicate that if you show kindness to someone in need now the favor will be returned many times over later on.
libra,You are at a crossroads as far as a creative project is concerned. Do you carry on with it, although it’s a struggle, or do you give up and focus your energy in a new direction? Only you can decide, so give it some serious thought.
libra,It’s good that you have the confidence to take risks but not so good if you take them wildly. As the Sun nears the career angle of your chart make sure you don’t do anything silly on the work front. Important people are watching.
libra,It’s important that you have a long-term plan because if you are in two minds about what it is you should be aiming for you could waste both time and energy. On the work front, especially, have a goal and go for it with everything you’ve got.
libra,The Sun in Cancer at this time of year is important for your career and for dealings with employers and other influential people. For that reason alone you must watch what you say and, above all, watch how you say it.
libra,You will be in an adventurous mood over the next two or three days and that’s good because the planets suggest that if you go some place you have never been before you will meet someone who lights up your life. Yes, it could be love!,libra,Not everyone will approve of what you get up to today but that won’t worry you one little bit. The planets will bring out the devil-may-care side of your nature over the next 24 hours. You will thoroughly enjoy shocking people.
libra,Mars in your sign makes you believe you can do anything you choose but other aspects warn if you act without thinking today you could end up a serious loser. Stay on the good side of people in positions of power.
libra,Tomorrow’s new moon will bring with it a golden opportunity to move up in the world, but it won’t come for free – you will have to give something of value in return. Is it a trade worth making? The fact is you cannot afford not to.
libra,You can expect something big to happen on the work front over the next few days. But why wait for things to happen to you? Why not make them happen yourself? Show those in positions of power you are ready to be promoted.
libra,No matter how many negative things may be going on around you be positive and believe you have been blessed with remarkable good fortune. Remember: the world you inhabit is a reflection of what goes on in your heart and your head.
libra,Your imaginative powers will be on a high over the next seven days, so visualize what it is you most wish to accomplish and start taking the steps that can make it happen. Your mind is a more powerful tool than you realize.
libra,Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Gemini will do wonders for your confidence over the next 48 hours and it won’t be long before what you’ve been worrying about is consigned to the dustbin of history – where it belongs.
libra,Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, has been moving retrograde in recent weeks, so not everything has worked out the way you expected it to. Never mind – as from today you will find your feet, and your head, again.
libra,Listen to what your inner voice tells you today because not only is it good advice but it’s the kind of advice you won’t get from other people. The answers you seek are not “out there” in the world but hidden in the depths of your heart.
libra,Travel and social plans may be disrupted today, so try not to make promises you won’t be able to keep. There is no point trying to look too far ahead. Concentrate on who and what is in front of you at this very moment.
libra,You have allowed certain people to get away with things they did not deserve to get away with. Now you must balance things out and see to it that they pay for their mistakes. Next time, don’t let things get so out of hand.
libra,This will be an emotional weekend for you and looking back a few days hence you may wonder why you overreacted in such spectacular fashion. Try not to be so sensitive to criticism, either at home or at work. Words can’t really hurt you.
libra,Trust your instincts this week, even if they lead you in a different direction to everyone else. Actually you rather enjoy going against the flow and deep down you know it’s the right thing to do. Trust your inner voice.
libra,The more nice things you say about others today the more nice things they will do for you in the near future. You will, of course, have to make your compliments sound sincere (especially if they’re not) but it’s an effort worth making.
libra,You seem to be in a bit of a slump and things are unlikely to pick up until you admit that the old way of doing things may not be so good after all. You’re an ideas person, so think of ways to boost your productivity.
libra,Others may tell you that your recent good fortune was pure luck but you know better. You are a Libra. You are special. More importantly you are the kind of person who is never satisfied with things as they are. Keep reaching. Keep achieving.
libra,Someone in a position of authority clearly likes you but if you take that as a sign that you can do as you please you are sadly mistaken. Important people are looking to you to provide a lead, so don’t let them, or yourself, down.
libra,You may be tempted to say something negative to a friend today but you are advised against it. Even if what you say is true and even if your motives are pure you not only won’t receive any thanks but you could cause a long-term split.
libra,Because today’s full moon occurs in the area of your chart that governs your family life there will likely be a few emotional ups and downs on the home front. No matter what is said or done just forgive and forget and move on.
libra,Over the next few days you will rediscover your talent for getting people working together as a team. As Libra is a cardinal sign you usually like to take the lead but on this occasion you will be content to be one among many.
libra,You will be both assertive and adventurous over the next 24 hours and that’s good. If you believe in your abilities then anything and everything is possible for you. Employers and other important people will be impressed by your can-do attitude.
libra,Your situation is not as bad as you think and what happens over the next seven days will prove it. Make a conscious effort to look on the bright side and keep telling yourself that, overall, you are very much on an upward course.
libra,There is no point getting angry with those who have let you down. The more you shout at them the more likely it is they will make further mistakes. You need to change your attitude. A more forgiving outlook will work wonders.
libra,Treat what happens over the next few days as an opportunity for advancement, personally and professionally. And treat people you meet as potential friends and allies. Show the world what a go-getter and trend-setter you can be – but nicely.
libra,You need to decide which is more important to you: love or ambition. You can, of course, have both but if you are wise you will put personal happiness first and professional success second. People are more important than things.
libra,You need to shake things up a bit. On the work front, especially, you seem to have fallen into a rut of late, so it’s time to inject a bit more energy and excitement into what has become, to be blunt, a lazy routine.
libra,The planets in their courses are urging you to be a bit less suspicious than you usually are. They also suggest that even if you do lose out in some way it won’t be by much. In a nutshell: stop worrying and start living.
libra,The planets warn that in some areas it might be wise to play safe and stick with what you know and trust. Creatively and romantically you have a lot to gain but also a lot to lose, so don’t go to extremes – find a workable middle way.
libra,You will get the chance to show what you can do today and you must seize it and use it. If you allow such a golden opportunity to pass you by you may spend the remainder of the year kicking yourself mentally for being so wasteful.
libra,Life is meant to be enjoyed and that is exactly what you will be doing over the next few days – enjoying yourself. Your can-do attitude will serve you very well indeed and others will be attracted by your positive vibes.
libra,No one doubts you have talent but talent is only one part of the equation – the more important part by far is enthusiasm, and with Jupiter so strong in your chart at the moment you’ve got it coming out of your ears. Do something wonderful!,libra,You have a tendency to believe in yourself to such a degree that you think nothing can ever go wrong – which is great – but you also need to recognize that everyone has limits. Mercury will point out a few of them to you today.
libra,Things may not be working out exactly as you hoped they would but there is no need to change direction. Cosmic activity in one of the better areas of your chart this weekend will put everything right and you’ll soon be smiling again.
libra,Sometimes you need subtlety and strategy as well as strength and what happens over the next few days will remind you of that fact. To put it simply: to get what you desire you will have to make sure others get what they desire too.
libra,If what you are working on refuses to conform to your expectations maybe you should draw a line under it and go back to basics. Most importantly, you need to accept that it doesn’t help in any way to set yourself such difficult targets.
libra,Have faith in your own ideas and don’t be afraid to take a calculated risk. Deep down you know you are on the right track and that what you are working on is meaningful, so keep going and don’t ever waste time looking back.
libra,Everything that occurs in your life is part of a wider and deeper plan, so don’t try too hard to change things because it’s unlikely to happen. Sit back and let fate take its course – and success and happiness are sure to follow.
libra,As a cardinal sign winning is important to you but sometimes you take it too far and expect too much of yourself. What happens today will remind you how good the simple things in life can be, none of which require you to be the best.
libra,If you try to force others to follow your lead today they will refuse. If, however, you use your charm to win them over you will find it quite easy to maneuver them in the direction you want them to go. You’re a major persuader!,libra,This is an especially good time for social activities but you fear you won’t find the time to do what makes you happiest. Just because your In tray is piled high does not mean you can’t have fun. Give yourself a day or two off.
libra,There is a danger now that you could push yourself too hard and put your wellbeing at risk. There is a simple rule you must follow to make sure you stay fit and healthy: Don’t go to extremes. Libra is the sign of balance – remember?,libra,The more others try to persuade you that now is not the time to try something different the more confident you can be that it’s exactly the right time. You like taking chances and you’re good at it too. Be a pioneer. Discover something new.
libra,Do something out of the ordinary today, something others would not expect of you. If your instincts tell you to go for something you must not hesitate for even a moment. There is glory at stake and you must not let it pass you by.
libra,You expect great things of yourself, which is good, but sometimes you go too far and set yourself targets that are impossible to reach. What happens over the next few days will bring you back to earth with a bump – and a bruise or two to your ego.
libra,You may be surprised that someone you know socially is prepared to put your interests ahead of their own but you should not be. For quite some time they have been trying to tell you that they think of you as more than just a friend!,libra,The planets will bring you into contact with people who share your ideals. They will also boost your belief that you can make a difference in the world and that working with others you can change things for the better. But don’t get fanatical about it.
libra,There is no point discussing what you want to do with family and friends because they are sure to try to make you change your mind. You should be confident enough to move ahead on your own initiative. Do what feels right to you.
libra,The more you try to tell others what they should be doing this week the more they will resist and before you know it you could have a rebellion on your hands. Just accept that the full moon makes some people touchy and unmanageable.
libra,Over the next few days you will find it easy to put your thoughts into words – and even easier to deliver those words with considerable force. You are not in the mood to pussyfoot around just to protect other people’s feelings.
libra,You need to take life at a more relaxed pace over the next 24 hours. You will have to deal with important issues, of course, but it is how you deal with them that makes all the difference. Seriously, there is nothing to worry about.
libra,You are unlikely to be tactful when dealing with people whose views and opinions you disagree with but that’s okay because you are as entitled to your viewpoint as they are to theirs. Give as good as you get over the next 24 hours.
libra,The planets suggest you are thinking about buying something costly. It’s your money and you can do what you want with it but is it something you need or is it an impulse purchase? Think about it before you hand over your credit card.
libra,You will have to make a conscious effort over the next 24 hours not to let your fears get the better of you. Whatever it is you are worried about it is almost certainly an illusion. Put it out of your mind – and out of your life.
libra,Steer clear of people who always seem to take a negative view of life. There will always be those who think the world is falling apart but you know the world has rarely been in better shape – and you’re in pretty good shape too!,libra,Yes, a rival has been saying things about you behind your back, but there is no need for you to get uptight about it. How can they hurt you? The short answer is they can’t. You hold all the right cards – and are loved by all the right people.
libra,Try not to see conspiracies where none exist. There may indeed be one or two things going on that seem a bit suspicious but people are not talking behind your back – and if they are it’s because they are planning a surprise treat for you.
libra,With Mars, planet of action, moving through one of the more materialistic areas of your chart you will jump at the chance to move up in the world over the next few days. Just make sure what you do benefits you, not other people.
libra,Don’t try to stop a friend or relative from doing something you do not approve of. Most likely it will make them even more determined to do it, just to annoy you. The only person you should be concerned with is yourself.
libra,The planets warn you need to accept the fact that you won’t be able to do everything, no matter how carefully you manage your time. Either cut back on your ambitions or get help. Of course, if you are really sensible you will do both.
libra,The Sun’s change of signs will lead to a mellowing in your mood and that’s probably no bad thing as you have been a bit hyper of late. If you take nothing too seriously over the next 48 hours you won’t suffer any serious damage.
libra,Your confidence may be a bit fragile at the moment but that is no reason to curtail your ambitions. On the contrary, tomorrow’s new moon will encourage you to think of new ways you can cash in on your talents. Be bold!,libra,A negative feeling has been nagging at you these past few days and you can’t seem to shift it. What you need to understand and accept is that you are not responsible for the bad things that go on in the world. Focus on good things only.
libra,You will make your point more effectively today if you stay calm and back up your arguments with facts that can’t be denied. Others can rant and rave if they like but it won’t convince anyone. Your serene demeanor will make you look good.
libra,Don’t expect too much of other people today because they will be inclined to say one thing while doing something completely different. There is nothing much you can do about other people’s attitudes and actions, so take it all in your stride.
libra,It would appear that someone thinks you are an easy touch. Are they correct? The moon’s eclipse of Saturn this weekend warns you need to be careful when dealing with money. Make sure you know where your cash is at all times.
libra,You may be good at juggling several tasks at once but now you’re beginning to show signs of strain. The planets urge you to cut back on your commitments and focus on the one thing that merits your attention. You know what it is. ,libra,Do something out of the ordinary today, something that makes those around you sit up and take notice. It doesn’t have to be anything outrageous, just something that reminds others you are special. Maybe you need to remind yourself as well.
libra,Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into your birth sign today, so you will know instantly what needs to be done. But it does not mean you have to do it straight away. If you get a great idea sleep on it for a while.
libra,You will do best today if you make a conscious effort to shut out the world and create a mental and emotional bubble inside which everything is peaceful and calm. You don’t have to be a party animal every day of the week.
libra,At some stage today you will realize how hard it can be to understand certain people – they just won’t fit into the neat little boxes your mind has constructed. Take the hint and accept that people, like life in general, can be messy.
libra,You want to move up in the world, of course, but try not to be too pushy over the next 48 hours or you could undo a lot of the good work you have done in recent weeks. You will be judged mainly on how you help others.
libra,If someone you approach for assistance this weekend gives you a less than positive response, don’t worry about it and certainly don’t feel sorry for yourself. According to the planets you don’t need anyone’s help – you just need to believe in yourself.
libra,You need to let go of feelings and habits which belong to the past. You crave balance and stability but, perversely, you will only find them when you stop looking so hard. Also, there are some things you no longer need – get rid of them.
libra,Don’t listen to people who say you should do something one way when every instinct you have tells you that it should be done another way. Trust your own inner voice, not the voices of know-it-alls who really know nothing.
libra,Sheer force of personality will see you past whatever obstacles block your path over the next 24 hours. You are in no mood to take prisoners and anyone foolish enough to take you on is likely to regret it. Try not to be brutal.
libra,Someone will try to undermine your confidence today but they won’t succeed. You know who you are and you know what you are worth and their words won’t change that in any way. It may change the way you think about them though.
libra,The most important thing today is that you communicate what you have to say in plain and simple language. Not everyone possesses your way with words, so make sure all can understand you. It’s important that you make yourself heard.
libra,No matter how ambitious a Libra you may be there are more important things in life than material success, and today you will be reminded what they are. Relationships, friendships and travel plans are all well starred over the next 24 hours.
libra,You may have to say something harsh to someone you love today but in the long-term your words will have the desired effect. A minor confrontation now is preferable to a major one later on, so speak up and get your message across.
libra,It would appear that a colleague cares only about what they want and could not care less what you want. In which case why are you still working alongside them? The world is full of possibilities, so break free and make your own future.
libra,Try not to criticize yourself for no good reason. In fact, try not to criticize yourself even if there is a good reason. If you made a mistake of some kind then learn from it quickly and move on. Today’s failure can be tomorrow’s success.
libra,Something you thought was a permanent part of your world will disappear today but there is no need to feel sad about it. On the contrary, by creating a space in your life you will encourage something even better to come in and fill it.
libra,Mercury, the planet of the mind, in your sign makes this the ideal time to get your head around what you need to change to make your life more complete. You must be practical though – don’t let idle daydreams lead you astray.
libra,Whether or not you have the necessary experience to take on a new role on the work front is irrelevant – what matters is that you have the intelligence and the ambition. The best way to get ahead is to stop worrying and just go for it.
libra,There is no reason why you should beat yourself up about something that went wrong. If you indulge your emotions too much you may lose sight of all the good things you have to be thankful for. Make a list of them today.
libra,You will meet a deadline by the skin of your teeth this weekend. You could, of course, finish it in half the time and with half the effort too if you were to draw up a plan and stick to it, but where’s the fun in that?,libra,When the Sun moves into your birth sign on Tuesday you will get a new lease of life. Before then, however, it might be a good idea to review the successes and failures of the past few months. Most importantly, what can you learn about yourself?,libra,Is it in your interests to follow a certain course of action? Do you even know what your interests are? Your mind may be a bit confused today but tomorrow, when the Sun moves into your birth sign, all will be clear, so leave it for 24 hours.
libra,You are determined to put right what you feel has gone wrong with your life and with the Sun moving into your birth sign today you can sense that the time to act has arrived. Indeed it has, especially as there is a new moon tomorrow.
libra,A new moon on your birthday means you no longer need to keep a low profile. No doubt you’ve done well for yourself in various supporting roles but now you must push your way to the front of the stage and take over. It’s your life and your show.
libra,You may seem calm and confident on the outside but deep down you fear the worst. The good news is that whatever it is that has got you so worried will be out of your life by the end of the day. So lighten up.
libra,Positive developments in your social life may have the edge taken off them by bad news concerning your finances today, but don’t sweat it. Mercury’s move into the money area of your chart tomorrow will bring an obvious answer.
libra,If you let the universe know what you want over the coming 12 months the universe will give it to you with no questions asked. If you can think it you can do it. If you can imagine it you can make it a reality. Put a name to your dreams and watch them come true.
libra,Whatever triumphs or disasters you face over this year one thing is certain: you’ll love every moment of it. There is something in the Libra outlook that sees life as a enjoyable challenge and, win or lose, you are determined to have fun. Others will follow your example.
libra,There has been a great deal of tension in your life of late but with Venus, your ruler, moving into your sign today you can expect things to be a bit more relaxed. The secret, of course, is to not take life quite so seriously.
libra,You know what needs to be done to improve a relationship – so get on and do it. A week or so from now a lunar eclipse in your opposite sign will challenge both of you, so make sure the bonds of love are strong.
libra,Whatever challenges you are faced with today you should be able to find ways to deal with them. Even if they prove tougher than expected there is sure to be someone you can turn to for assistance and advice. All you have to do is ask.
libra,There is an easy way and a hard way to get to your destination. The easy way is to co-operate with people you don’t always get along with. The hard way is to try to do everything yourself. Either way, you will get there in the end.
libra,The most important thing on your birthday is that you are honest with yourself about who you are and where you are trying to go. Whatever your current position you can improve on it, but you must be clear of thought and decisive in action.
libra,If you think big and act big then, inevitably, there will be occasions when you make big mistakes as well. No doubt you will make plenty of them over the coming 12 months but you will also enjoy successes that are not just big but huge.
libra,According to the planets you may be feeling a bit sorry for yourself at the moment. You need to snap out of it because there are all sorts of great opportunities heading your way and if you are drowning in tears you may miss them.
libra,The planets urge you to let go of something that is holding you back from being the best that you can be. It may be a belief, it may be an attitude, it may be a relationship, but whatever it is you’ve got to leave it behind – not later, but now.
libra,Keep affairs of the heart on a fun level today, because the more you try to force a relationship in a certain direction the more the one you love will feel pressured, and that’s not good. The subtle approach is by far the best approach.
libra,Not only is there a lunar eclipse on your birthday this year but Mars and Jupiter are strong too, so the next 12 months will see challenges aplenty. Be bold, be brave and, above all, be the kind of Libra who always finds something to be happy about.
libra,In your mind’s eye you have an image of the person you think you should be, but is it a realistic image? The message of your birthday chart is that you need to stop setting yourself impossible targets and find ways to just enjoy who you already are.
libra,Today and over the weekend you need to either throw yourself into a serious project or leave it completely alone and go off and do something purely for fun. It must be one or the other: if you try to do both you’ll get nowhere.
libra,Someone you are close to emotionally seems to be in a strange frame of mind at the moment but there is no reason why you should be worried about it. Come the start of next week they will be back to who and what they were before.
libra,You are torn between two entirely different ways of approaching the coming year. Do you go all out for glory and let other people look out for themselves? Or do you put helping those less fortune than you front and center? It must be the latter. ,libra,You must not trust in shortcuts today, not even those you have used many times before. The planets demand that everything is done by the book over the next 24 hours, even if you know how to complete a task in half the time.
libra,A Venus-Jupiter link on your birthday means the coming year will see you making new friendships, new alliances and, maybe, a new romantic attachment too. The more open you are about your feelings the more you will get out of life. Get plenty!,libra,Do you have something to say? Is there a message you want to give to the world? Of course there is and with the Sun and Mars strong on your birthday you will make sure everyone knows what it is. You’ll make a huge difference over the coming 12 months.
libra,You know what you want and you know how to get it but with mind planet Mercury still moving retrograde can you be absolutely certain you have made the right call? Give it a day or two before making a final decision. What’s the rush?,libra,Mercury and Venus join forces on your birthday, making it easy for you to breeze through life without a care. There is, however, a world of difference between not having a care and actually not caring. Watch out you don’t lose the human touch.
libra,Venus and Mars, the relationships planets, join forces on your birthday, promising fun days and passionate nights. It’s not what you do for a living or how much you earn that matters, but what positive impressions you make on a one-to-one level.
libra,Friendships are under excellent stars for the coming 12 months but because Mercury is moving retrograde on your birthday you need to be selective about who you spend your time with. Get to know people who challenge you to think deeply about life.
libra,You can continue to deny you have a problem if you like but that won’t make it go away. The planets urge you to face up to what needs to be changed in your life. Be brave, be positive and be the kind of Libra who is always looking to improve.
libra,The most important thing over the next 12 months is that you consciously focus on what is positive in your life and put what is negative out of your mind. Strive to be a force for good in the world and the world will be good to you in return.
libra,Your mind is full of big ideas but are you able to turn them into some kind of new reality? Now is the time to find out as the planets urge you to make an extra special effort – from which you can expect an extra special reward.
libra,Don’t let problems of a financial nature dent your confidence. The Sun in Scorpio over the next few weeks will bring new possibilities and all you really need to do is keep your eyes and ears open. You’re better off than you think you are.
libra,You have bent over backwards in recent weeks to accommodate other people’s wishes but now you can see it did no good at all. If others won’t give you what you so clearly deserve this weekend then you must seize it for yourself.
libra,You need to get your priorities right and you need to understand that obsessing over petty issues is a total waste of time and energy. There are things that you would like to do and things that you have to do. Do only the latter this week.
libra,Put other people’s needs first over the next 24 hours. A good deed done today will come back to you several times over before the end of the year. The universe always rewards those who seek to lighten the load of their fellow man.
libra,Libra is the sign of the balance and over the next 24 hours you must find ways to balance your head and your heart. Something may sound logical and reasonable but if your inner voice urges you to be cautious don’t you dare ignore it.
libra,You will be sensitive to other people’s moods today – so sensitive, in fact, that you may prefer to be by yourself for a while. That’s okay. You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party, especially when the other guests are so dull!,libra,Fix your attention on a situation and learn as much about it as you can. According to the planets the more you know about what is going on the better placed you will be to benefit from coming upheavals, which won’t be long in arriving.
libra,You may need to shut yourself off from the world this weekend, if only so you have the time and the space to remind yourself what it is you are aiming for in this life. Listen to your inner voice, then act on what it tells you.
libra,A problem that once gave you sleepless nights now seems to have disappeared, but don’t be fooled. It has merely gone into hiding and will make a reappearance around the time of Thursday’s full moon. Be ready for it and, this time, deal with it.
libra,A challenge of some kind will push you beyond the rather narrow limits you have imposed upon yourself in recent weeks. Don’t worry that you may not be up to the task – you will find hidden reserves of talent and energy. ,libra,You may be in a position to help a friend resolve a dispute of some kind but unless they directly ask you to get involved you are strongly advised to keep your distance. This is a problem they can and should face up to by themselves.
libra,Today’s Sun-Uranus link warns that changing things for the sake of it is both foolish and dangerous. If something isn’t broken then why try to fix it? Your motto for the day should be to leave things alone, both at home and at work. ,libra,You are always ready to help other people out but that does not mean they should take your good nature for granted. Maybe it’s time to drop the nice guy act and start getting tough with those who are using you for their own ends.
libra,Different people have different histories and different personalities and therefore see things in different ways. They also have different ideas of what is right and what is wrong. You need to understand that, and act accordingly, over the next 24 hours.
libra,Routine matters must not be left to other people today, not if you want a good job made of them. Certain responsibilities may be tiresome and take up an excessive amount of your time but they have to be done, so get cracking.
libra,Don’t take risks with money this week as the planets warn you could quite easily mislead yourself into thinking that your financial position is stronger than it actually is. Keep your cash in your pocket.
libra,No matter how hard you try to control your feelings today Mars and Pluto will make it extremely difficult not to get angry about something. On this occasion you are probably right to blow your top, so say your piece – loudly – and get it over with.
libra,According to the planets you may have gone too far in your criticisms of a friend or work colleague and at some stage today you will have to backtrack a bit. But only a bit. The essence of your complaint still holds true. ,libra,The answer to a problem of some kind will become crystal clear today. It was there all the time, of course, only you were unable to see it. You may have to pay out more than you expected but it’s worth it if it sets you free.
libra,Positive thoughts will bring positive results today. Even a financial problem you have been struggling with for weeks or months can be resolved, especially if you are prepared to listen to the advice of an older and wiser colleague.
libra,What you are given today may not be what you wanted but if you accept it in the right spirit it will lead to something better. Likewise, when it is you who is doing the giving, listen to your head as well as your heart. ,libra,Your life is changing for the better and what happens this weekend will confirm that fact. Even when things go wrong you will take them in your stride and find something to smile about. And that’s the key: strive only to be happy. ,libra,You will be snowed under with offers to make a name for yourself over the next seven days. For best results, keep your options open. You don’t have to make a final decision just yet, so play hard to get. Let others chase after you.
libra,Don’t listen to those who say you must follow the “official” line on something. The more they try to make sure you conform to their rules the more convinced you should be that their rules are wrong. Trust your own moral compass. ,libra,As one of the zodiac’s cardinal signs you can be amazingly forceful at times and because there is something you desire you won’t hesitate to be assertive today. Be sensible though – know when it is wise to hold back.
libra,The planets indicate you are destined to offend someone over the next 24 hours, no matter which course of action you choose to take. So, whatever it is you are planning, do it quickly, do it well and get it over with.
libra,Affairs of the heart are, of course, important but as relationship planet Venus squares up to Neptune, planet of illusion, today you are advised not to take them too seriously. You may not be able to love but you can still have a good laugh. ,libra,You appear to have missed a chance to improve your money situation and now you are wishing you had been more adventurous. Be that as it may you were right not to take chances. Even better opportunities won’t be long in coming.
libra,Everything you say over the next 48 hours will come out the way you mean it and everything you do will work out the way you intended. This will be a good weekend by any standards but with luck could be out of this world. ,libra,You seem to be in a much more relaxed frame of mind now that the Sun has moved into the most outgoing are of your chart. Money worries may not be behind you entirely but they certainly won’t stop you having fun.
libra,There may be certain patterns of behavior that you would like to overcome but you have got to be sensible about it. You can’t change overnight, nor can you just give things up. Think long-term and replace bad habits with good habits. ,libra,Feelings you thought you had outgrown or left behind will make a return over the next two or three days but they are nothing to worry about. Remember though that you cannot turn the clock back, no matter how strong your feelings may be.  ,libra,A dream you’ve had for years is about to become a reality. It may not come about in the precise way you expected but that doesn’t matter – the important thing is that you recognize how fortunate you are and make the most of the opportunity.
libra,Even if you are happy with the way life is going it will pay you to try something different today. A new routine may seem a little odd to begin with but once you get used to it you will wonder why you did not change sooner.
libra,Someone will say something today that is extremely flattering, but don’t let it go to your head. The praise may be thoroughly deserved but if you allow your pride to grow it may get in the way of seeing what still needs to be done.
libra,If you feel the need to escape from duties and obligations then now is the time. The Sun in Sagittarius makes it easy for you to take a short break but no one will give it to you, so get up and go and come back on Monday refreshed.
libra,The planets warn this may not be the best of times to back your hunches – not because they are wrong necessarily but because you will have better options to choose from later in the week. You will sense when the moment is right.
libra,Something is missing from your life and you won’t be happy until you find out what it is. According to the planets it is not something “out there” in the world but something “in here” in your heart. Change your outlook and your life will change too.  ,libra,You may be wondering if you would be better off in a different place with a different group of people. Maybe you would, but don’t make any hasty decisions. The full moon at the weekend will point you in the right direction. ,libra,If you hope for the best today you will surely get it. What you need to realize is that you always attract into your life the kind of luck you think you deserve. You deserve the best, so expect it and it will be given to you.
libra,Employers and people in positions of authority will flatter you shamelessly today. Are they after something? Of course they are! The fact is you are in a great position and have every right to use it to get a better deal for yourself.
libra,Today’s full moon is sure to cause some tension, but because it falls in your fellow Air sign of Gemini you should be able to handle it. Remember too that the best way to handle people who annoy you is simply to ignore them.
libra,An instant response may not be the best response over the next few days, so take your time and make sure you communicate your true feelings. Remember too that you are always loved, no matter how difficult a particular day may be.
libra,If you make an effort to get to know someone you previously thought of as boring you may be surprised to find they are more interesting than you imagine. They say you can’t judge a book by its cover and in this case that may be true. ,libra,You will hear something today that sounds too good to be true and you are right to be suspicious because what you are being told is only half the story. Listen to your inner voice – it knows the difference between fact and fiction. ,libra,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart could make you more emotional than usual but maybe that’s no bad thing. Let loved ones know that you still care for them, even though your life seems to revolve around work at the moment.
libra,Some of the people you meet today and tomorrow could be very important to you professionally or financially in the future, so be on your best behavior and dress to impress. You know how to flirt, don’t you? That will help too!,libra,If you find it hard to make up your mind about what you should be doing today then ask someone you trust. Even if you disagree with them and do the exact opposite of what they suggest you will at least be doing something.
libra,Forget about details and other petty distractions over the next 48 hours. Focus on the big picture and let others worry about the small stuff. Despite what some people might say you don’t have to be in control of each and every situation.
libra,If a loved one insists on having their own way over something trivial it might be wise to play along and at least pretend you agree with them. If it earns you the space you need to get more important things done then it’s a sacrifice worth making.
libra,You will be in a confident mood today but because you think you can get away with anything you might try something you know is forbidden. It may work out okay in the short-term but in the long-term you will certainly regret it.
libra,You don’t have to explain your motives or your actions to anyone. If someone demands to know what you are doing just tell them to mind their own business. The atmosphere may be tense for a while but they’ll get the message. ,libra,Be wary of those who offer you something for nothing today. They may not want any kind of payment for it now but it will give them lots of leverage later on when they want something from you. Don’t be fooled. ,libra,There may be all sorts of exciting things going on in your social environment but you must ignore them all and focus on getting a family matter sorted. Let loved ones know it’s time to draw a line under a long-running feud. ,libra,If you go after your target too directly or too forcefully today you may find that it eludes you. You’ve got to be subtle in your approach, you’ve got to bide your time and wait for exactly the right moment. It won’t be long in coming.
libra,Honesty is always the best policy even though it does not always go down well with those you are being honest about! It’s not your fault if others get upset with what you have to say this weekend – it’s their fault for making mistakes.
libra,Force yourself to be positive about what you have to do during the early part of the week. There may be a dozen more interesting things you would rather be doing but duty comes first even though it’s the holiday season.
libra,A personal issue that has been causing you problems will take a turn for the better, though it may take a few days to get going. The most important thing is that you don’t try to hang on to what is now moving out of your life.
libra,Don’t worry too much if others go out of their way to poke holes in your plans today – they just want to make sure you know what you are doing. You don’t need anyone’s permission to follow your dreams. Go it alone if you have to. ,libra,Make time for family members today and make sure they know how much you love them. Too often you take it for granted that they know what’s in your heart but it won’t hurt to be a bit more emotionally expressive.
libra,You may not like it that rivals have the upper hand at the moment but appearances can be deceptive and before the day is over you will have won back your favored status. The simple fact is you are tougher than they are – and smarter too. ,libra,If you try to help someone out today but they reject your advances don’t take it personally. Most likely they are under so much pressure at the moment that they cannot think straight. They will ask you for help sooner or later. ,libra,Go out of your way to be nice to friends and family over the next 48 hours. Not that you are not nice to them usually but this weekend you will get the chance to overcome differences and difficulties once and for all. It’s worth the effort.
libra,Aim for quality rather than quantity over the next few days. It’s good to be enthusiastic but if you take on too much as you go into the new year you will struggle later when, inevitably, your motivation begins to wane. Pace yourself.
libra,Try not to dwell on negative news. The planets warn you are taking a situation far too seriously, certainly more seriously than anyone else is taking it. If it does not bother the people it most affects then why should it bother you?,libra,It may be a bit quiet for your tastes at the moment but don’t worry because things will speed up and heat up considerably towards the end of the week. Between now and then get plenty of rest – chances are you are going to need it.
libra,Be careful when listening to what other people tell you, because they may not be telling you the whole truth. You may be in a party mood at the moment but that does not mean you can throw caution to the wind. ,libra,Jupiter, planet of expansion, will bring a change of fortunes early in the new year, and a lot more fun as well. Ring in 2015 in the company of friends and expect to be showered with good things over the next few days. ,libra,Some kind of upheaval is likely over the next 24 hours but it need not be as bad as it sounds. In fact it could be quite beneficial, especially if you are one of those Librans who find it hard to express their feelings. ,libra,Venus, the planet of love, moves into one of the best areas of your chart this weekend. Everyone knows you can be assertive but how many know you can be romantic too? Someone fortunate person is about to find out! ,libra,Focus on affairs of the heart and don’t worry too much about what’s going in your work or career. Monday’s full moon is sure to have some of your colleagues acting strangely but it won’t last, so don’t be offended. ,libra,There are so many changes taking place now that you may feel a bit insecure. That is entirely natural and certainly not an excuse to start feeling sorry for yourself. Libra is a cardinal sign, so step up and show your leadership qualities. ,libra,What is right for other people won’t necessarily be right for you today, so don’t follow their example just because you think it is expected of you. Libra is an Air sign, which means you have a mind of your own. Don’t forget to use it. ,libra,Someone you don’t always get along with will be unusually friendly towards you today and you are right to be a bit suspicious. According to the planets they are up to no good, so be on your guard at all times. ,libra,Whatever disagreements or differences of opinion you may have had with friends or family members in recent weeks you can quite easily iron them out now. Make the first move and let it be known you don’t hold a grudge. ,libra,Everyone has limits, even a Libra, and if you stay within them nothing much will go wrong today. But if you get the idea that you can do anything you like, then you could make a fool of yourself – and you hate being laughed at. ,libra,Anyone who tries to tie you down to one place and one activity over the next 48 hours is doomed to fail. You are determined to move about a bit and see new places and meet new people. Anyone who tries to stop you is a bore.
libra,You will have to work on something that does not interest you much this week but make a good job of it anyway. Important people are watching and if they like what they see you will get more interesting jobs in the future. ,libra,The tougher the challenge the more you like it and that’s just as well because the planets indicate you will be put to the test over the next few days. Just make sure you don’t take on too much. Know your limits and respect them.
libra,What happens today may surprise you but with your ruler Venus on good terms with Uranus, planet of disruption, it will also change your life in interesting ways. Don’t hold on so tightly to the past – the future is where it’s at. ,libra,Everything seems to be going so well at the moment that you may get a bit suspicious and start wondering if it’s all too good to be true. On the contrary, colleagues and relatives will do anything for you, so enjoy it. ,libra,You will have to do something you don’t want to do today and most likely you will let everyone know – loudly – that it’s not your idea of fun. But you will do it anyway because you have your reputation to think of. Be professional.
libra,You will be less inclined to worry about your cashflow situation today and over the weekend and that’s good. The only danger is you could go from one extreme to the other and start spending money like it grows on trees. It doesn’t. ,libra,The Sun in Capricorn at this time of year makes it a complete waste of time arguing with people, both at home and at work. No matter how sure you are of the facts they are simply too stubborn to recognize the truth. ,libra,Some way, some how you will make a big improvement in both your personal affairs and your working environment over the next few days. But if you really want to change things you must first change your attitude. Be positive. ,libra,You need to get the balance right between being assertive and being passive. Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Aquarius will see to it that the right opportunity arrives at the right time – and you must react to it in the right way.
libra,You can change a number of things over the next few days but if you really want a better day-to-day experience you must change your attitude. The way you see the world determines what kind of world it is going to be.
libra,A friend may want you to join them in some sort of social event today but don’t force yourself if you don’t feel up to it. Cosmic activity in the wellbeing area of your chart means you need rest and relaxation, not more stimulation. ,libra,If you restrict yourself to one way of completing a task you will get bored and either make a poor job of it or give up on it altogether. Keep yourself interested by varying your routine and setting yourself challenging targets,libra,Give a friend or family member the benefit of the doubt today, even if you suspect they are telling you lies. According to your solar chart you won’t lose out financially or emotionally, so why make an issue of it?,libra,Others may be striving to get ahead this weekend but your aims are more humble: you will be happy to get through the next 48 hours unscathed. For best results, don’t take life too seriously – treat it all as a bit of a game.
libra,Let loved ones know how much they mean to you and let them know you will always be there for them. Also, don’t use work as an excuse for not being able to spend quality time at home. You’re doing too much already. ,libra,Your logic circuits don’t seem to be functioning as they should at the moment, most likely because mind planet Mercury is in one of its retrograde phases. If in doubt, listen to what your inner voice is trying to tell you. ,libra,Venus, your ruler, moves into the wellbeing area of your chart today, making this the ideal time to take stock of your health and your fitness and decide what changes need to be made. They won’t have to be too drastic.
libra,You may not be entirely enthusiastic about what you are expected to do today but if you are smart you will do it anyway and do it well. Others look up to you as someone who can be relied on. Don’t disappoint them. ,libra,Because the Sun is moving through the most creative and dynamic area of your chart you won’t find it hard to start something special. Don’t listen to those who tell you to limit your ambitions, listen to your instincts – and follow them. ,libra,One way or another you will soon be moving up in the world, which is good news for you but bad news for your rivals who will be moving down. Don’t waste time feeling sorry for them. Would they feel sorry for you if the roles were reversed?,libra,Venus, your ruler, links with Neptune this weekend, so it might be wise to keep a low profile and conserve your energy, especially on the work front. Next week could be challenging, so save your best stuff for when it matters. ,libra,You can ask almost anything of almost anyone this coming week and chances are you will get it. Cosmic activity in your fellow Air sign of Aquarius makes you even more persuasive than usual – don’t let that talent go to waste.
libra,Anyone who thinks they know you will be mightily surprised today as you do the opposite of what they predicted. Whether you do it for fun or whether you do it for a reason, they won’t take you for granted in a hurry again. ,libra,Today’s full moon may bring a sense of urgency to your tasks but you still need to plan carefully or you could make a serious mistake. You don’t want to upset someone whose support could be crucial to your long-term success.
libra,If you start something new today you must expect it to take up a lot more time and energy than you expected. But in a way that’s good because it means you will have less time and energy to waste on trivial things.
libra,You are on the verge of giving up on something that you just can’t seem to crack. What you don’t realize is that you are closer to a breakthrough than you have ever been before. Hold on a little longer – you’re almost there. ,libra,Your principles may cost you money today but you are not the sort to abandon your standards for financial reward. More to the point, you are not the sort to admit you got it wrong once you have adopted a certain position! ,libra,Try not to get uptight if you come across someone whose lifestyle and beliefs you disapprove of this weekend. If they really offend you that much just stay out of their way. Alternatively, try getting to know what they’re really like.
libra,There are so many interesting things going on in your world at the moment that it would be a crime to waste time wondering what others are playing at. Don’t think about them, think about yourself and what you are hoping to achieve. ,libra,Tell the truth as you see it. There will be a lot of noise and confusion over the next few days and much of it will be designed to lead you away from what is really going on – but you are not so easily fooled. ,libra,Don’t blame yourself unduly for some kind of mistake – either it wasn’t your fault at all or it was the kind of thing that can happen to anyone at any time. You never claimed to be perfect, so others cannot demand it of you.
libra,Your latest project will be a resounding success, despite recent setbacks. Don’t worry that you have not made as much progress as you would have liked in recent weeks – there is still plenty of time to get it right. ,libra,Can you trust what someone tells you? According to the planets the only way to find out for sure is by doing what they say and seeing what happens. If they do let you down you won’t ever give them another chance.
libra,You will find it easy to forgive other people’s mistakes today but not so easy to forgive your own. The trouble is you have set such high standards for yourself there are bound to be times when you cannot live up to them.
libra,A friend will do something that annoys you this weekend and you won’t let the incident pass without comment. Hopefully they will get the message and back off, but if they don’t try not to make a war of it – it’s really not such a big deal.
libra,Something you thought was hugely important will turn out to be of no importance at all around the time the Sun changes signs in midweek. Once you realize how easily you got it wrong you won’t make the same mistake twice. ,libra,You will learn a lot about certain people this week, especially people you share your life with on a day-to-day basis. But you will learn more if you adopt a spirit of detachment. In other words, don’t take what you see and hear personally. ,libra,The Sun is about to move into the most hard-working area of your chart but that does not mean you have to do everything yourself. Spread the load over the next few days, otherwise come the weekend you may have no energy left. ,libra,Try not to push yourself quite so hard over the next few days. You can save a lot of time and energy by learning from other people’s mistakes – unless, of course, you are the kind of Libra who enjoys making your own.
libra,Something you are told may not ring true but don’t dismiss it out of hand. Conversely, something else you are told may seem obvious but don’t accept it without question. The only thing you can be sure of today is that nothing is for certain.
libra,As Venus, planet of love, moves into the relationship area of your chart today it’s likely you will meet someone who gets your pulse racing. That’s great but don’t get carried away – yet. Are they more than just a passing fancy? Time will tell.
libra,Like it or not you are not in the driving seat at the moment and will have to wait and see what other people do before deciding your own moves. The good news is they will likely do exactly what you were hoping they would. ,libra,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your daily routines will pile on the pressure over the next few days – but you can handle it. If you work hard during the day you will have the perfect excuse to party at night. ,libra,You may have to postpone something you were looking forward to either today or tomorrow but looking back from the end of the week you will be quite relieved you never got started. The universe is clearly trying to protect you. ,libra,Your mind may be sharp and clear at the moment but that does not necessarily mean the conclusions you reach will be right. A lot depends on whether the facts and figures you are working with can be trusted. Wherever possible, do your own research.
libra,Forget about duties and responsibilities and do what makes you happy. The simple fact is you are not in the mood for work and if you try to force yourself to do things that don’t inspire you the end result will be frustration and tears. Relax. ,libra,You will get the chance today, tomorrow and over the weekend to make serious progress in a creative endeavor of some sort. But however well it goes don’t get carried away because there is a lot of work to do yet – it’s still early days.
libra,You cannot solve your problems by throwing lots of cash at them – if anything that will just make matters worse. According to the planets it won’t be long before a better way presents itself, so give it time – and don’t worry so much.
libra,For reasons you cannot explain you have got a bad feeling about what a friend or colleague is proposing to do. Most likely your sixth sense is trying to tell you that it is not a good idea. How can you make them see that too?,libra,You will have to make some sort of detour this week and you could end up miles out of your way. Don’t worry about it though because wherever you go the scenery will be inspiring. There’s a lot of the world you still have to see.
libra,If you have a good idea you must let others know about it, especially people whose support can help you turn it into a reality. Don’t keep your schemes and dreams to yourself: they are big enough for everyone to share in. ,libra,You won’t hesitate to get involved in some kind of dispute today, even if it has nothing to do with you. Just make sure you know your facts before delivering opinions you have not been asked for. Or do you like looking silly?,libra,You will get along with just about everyone today, both on a personal and a professional level. Today’s links between Venus, your ruler, and Jupiter and Uranus will encourage you to see the best in people – all people, not just the ones you like.
libra,Try not to provoke any arguments or showdowns today, because while the moon is full you are unlikely to be on the winning side. This is one of those occasions when the best approach by far is to keep a low profile.
libra,If the only way to get what you want today is to reveal something about yourself that you would prefer to keep secret then maybe you are on the wrong track. According to the planets you may get the worst of the deal, so think again.
libra,Follow your heart this weekend, no matter where it might lead you nor what others might have to say about it. Finding happiness is not about career success or making more money, it’s about being true to who and what you really are. ,libra,Friends and relatives will be even more demanding than usual this week – they seem to believe you exist purely to do things for them. At some point you are going to have to burst their bubble. Make it sooner rather than later.
libra,Look for ways to co-operate with colleagues and people in positions of power. You have wasted enough time and energy trying to outdo each other, now you must go right the other way and work together as a team. Don’t laugh – it IS possible. ,libra,Make an effort to talk to loved ones and work colleagues and find out what they think and how they feel. Cosmic activity in your opposite signs of Aries means that if you are nice to other people they will be nice to you.
libra,A relationship that has been going through a rocky phase needs to be dealt with once and for all. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Aries suggests it may be better to call it a day – but ultimately only you can decide.
libra,Don’t take anything on trust today – check once, check twice, then check a third time just to be sure. Whatever you are planning you must make sure you have covered all the angles because the smallest overlooked detail could trip you up.
libra,Common sense should tell you that certain routines and methods are not working as well as they should and what happens over the next two or three days will surely confirm that. Look for ways to update how you do things.
libra,The problem you are struggling with is actually quite simple – it is your negative attitude that makes it look difficult! Try looking at life from a wider perspective and soon you will see that your “problem” is nothing of the sort.
libra,You will accomplish more over the next few days if you don’t take life so seriously. Setbacks are a fact of life but you don’t have to let them get to you. What happened to that Libran sense of balance? It all comes right in the end. ,libra,Make sure you know what you are getting into today because if you let other people take charge and decide what you will be doing you could end up in a place you don’t really want to go. It may be better to just stay at home. ,libra,How you react to people today and tomorrow will to a large extent determine how well you do financially and career-wise over the next few months. Go out of your way to find solutions to existing problems rather than create new ones.
libra,Tread carefully when dealing with partners and loved ones over the next 24 hours because even little things are likely to set them off. The last thing you need now is to spend your precious waking hours trying to calm them down.
libra,Work and health matters will be uppermost in your mind today and tomorrow, which is good because you have been overdoing it of late. Put your physical wellbeing ahead of everything else. What use is success if you are too tired to enjoy it?,libra,The Sun’s change of signs today means you are halfway through your solar year: a good point to look back and take stock of how far you have come. Only then will you be in the proper position to see how far you have still to go. ,libra,It might be an idea to take it easy this weekend, especially if you overdid it last weekend. Usually you start fast and run out of steam before the end. Over the next 48 hours, start slow and be there to challenge at the finish. ,libra,What changes can you make today so that tomorrow is not so fraught with anxieties? Your mind is clearer now than it has been for weeks, if not months, so one way or another you are sure to come up with a workable solution. ,libra,Your head may be full of big ideas but the planets warn this is not a good time to push too hard. You will achieve more in the long-term if you go with the flow rather than try to direct it over the next few days. ,libra,Don’t be too eager to uncover other people’s secrets or they may start digging around in your affairs – and who knows what they might find! No matter how interesting they may be there are some things that should always stay hidden.
libra,One of the things you are good at is inspiring people to improve themselves and over the next few days you will help at least one friend, and maybe several, do more and do better. They will love you for it, even more than they do now.
libra,You have been worrying about your money situation for no good reason and over the next few days you will see solutions where before you saw only problems. But that is not an excuse to go on yet another spending spree.
libra,A new relationship will start today or over the weekend. It may or may not be romantic in nature but whatever guise it takes it will be fun. This is also a good time to interact with large groups of people. Do some charity work.
libra,You will have to pull out of a social event you were looking forward to this weekend but although it may cause a certain amount of friction it’s the best thing to do. You have far more important things to worry about. You can party later.
libra,Go out of your way to heal a rift with a partner or loved. It might be hard for you to say sorry, especially if you believe that you are the one who has been wronged, but is it really so important? Make the first move. ,libra,Is there some overall goal you are working towards in life? If there is, you will take a giant step closer towards it today. If not, now is the time to decide who or what you should devote yourself to – besides yourself, of course! ,libra,Make sure you know what is expected of you before signing up for something new. You may feel you can handle whatever fate sends your way but the planets warn that some deals are best avoided, no matter how enticing they may look. ,libra,You will need to read between the lines today because what someone is trying to tell you is simply not true. You like to believe the best of people, of course, but this is one of those occasions when you need to be suspicious.
libra,You may have no idea how you reach certain conclusions today but don’t doubt them for a moment. Your mind is open on a much higher level now, so insights of one sort or another are to be expected – and embraced.
libra,No matter how fast you may be traveling at this moment in time you must cut back on your speed over the next 48 hours. Tomorrow’s lunar eclipse in your sign makes accidents more likely then usual, so take care.
libra,Because today’s lunar eclipse takes place in your sign you will easily get irritated with people who do not seem to share your energy and enthusiasm. But is it they who are dragging their feet or is it you who is being impulsive? Think about it.
libra,Now that communications planet Mercury is moving through your opposite sign you should find it easier to deal with partners and loved ones. You will certainly be able to see things more from their point of view, which always helps. ,libra,Don’t do what other people expect you to do – do what appeals to you, for whatever reason. If you let partners and colleagues dictate terms they will, and you can be sure they won’t be as favorable to you as they could have been. ,libra,Try not to get annoyed if someone whose support you rely on opposes you in some way today. They are entitled to their point of view and if they disagree with you they have a duty to say so. Maybe you should listen.
libra,This is one of the best times of the year for relationships, so don’t worry if you have not seen eye to eye with certain people of late because your differences are trivial. You are still very much on the same level mentally and emotionally.
libra,The ball is very much in someone else’s court at the moment and all you can do is wait to see how they are going to play it. Don’t get impatient if they take their time about it because that will encourage them to go even slower.
libra,Open up and reveal your true feelings today. If you are not happy with something, or someone, then say so. Don’t make it hard for others to read your mood. Let them know how you feel and what it is you need. You will get it.
libra,You should have plans to be on the move over the next 48 hours because with Venus, your ruler, moving into the most adventurous area of your chart you are sure to have fun and meet special people – maybe even The Special One.
libra,Can you trust what other people tell you? It depends when you ask. Midweek, when your ruler Venus opposes Saturn, is the time to be careful: don’t take anything on trust around this time. Check everything yourself – once, twice, then once again.
libra,It may be time to get yourself free of a relationship that used to hold you up but is now holding you back. Only you can choose what your next step is going to be but once you have made your choice you must be decisive. ,libra,If you think you are owed something, be it money, respect, or whatever, you can get it today. Mercury will help you find the words that can persuade others to give you what you desire. They simply won’t dare tell you “no”.
libra,A task you were not looking forward to won’t be as bad as you thought it would be – in fact, once you get going it may be enjoyable. That’s good, because the more you smile the happier those around you will be as well.
libra,Have a good time today. Go out and enjoy yourself. But watch how much you spend and watch who you spend it on, because some of your so-called friends will bleed you dry if you let them. Save some cash for the weekend. ,libra,Partnerships, including affairs of the heart, are well starred this weekend, so make sure you do things with your nearest and dearest, because the time you spend in each other’s company is of huge importance. What you do together lasts forever.
libra,Make sure you set your own targets for the week ahead. Others may say that some of your aims are impractical, and maybe they are, but don’t let that stop you. You won’t know what you are capable of until you try. So try! ,libra,The Sun leaves the relationship area of your chart today but that is not an excuse to pay less attention to the one you love. Show a little passion over the next 24 hours. They need to know you still care. And you do.
libra,Make your own value judgments today. What others say may be interesting but it is essential that you follow your instincts rather than follow the herd. As a rule, when the mob says one thing most likely the opposite thing is correct.
libra,You know exactly what you should be doing, even though you might find it hard to explain to others why you are doing it. But don’t let it worry you. Partners and loved ones will soon see there is method in your apparent madness.
libra,If you ask someone for a favor today chances are they will be more than willing to help you out. But don’t expect to get what you want for free – you will have to do something for them in return. Find out what it is first.
libra,There are ways to get what you want without turning people against you, so watch what you say and do and, especially, try to avoid treading on the toes of those who can tread back just as hard. Look for solutions, not confrontations.
libra,The most important thing now is that you believe in yourself and that you don’t let others talk you into settling for average or second best. Your dreams may seem out of reach to them but no way are they out of reach to you. ,libra,A major change in your circumstances needs to be acknowledged and accepted this week. The fact that you have new obligations is a reason for cheer, not dismay. You said you wanted something new in your life – well here it is! ,libra,If you hesitate for even a moment today you could miss out on an opportunity that may not come again for a very long time. No matter how tiring your weekend may have been make sure you stay alert over the next 24 hours.
libra,You seem to be having trouble at keeping a desire of some sort under wraps. Perhaps you should take the hint and let everyone know about it. According to the planets others will applaud you for being so open and honest.
libra,Relationships of all kinds are under favorable stars right now, so even if there have been a few harsh words of late you can, if you wish, patch things up and be friends again. Sometimes a little falling-out can lead to big love.
libra,Despite what some people might believe you rarely think only of yourself and you will get the chance to prove it over the next two or three days. You are at your best when fighting on the side of truth and justice. But always fight fair.
libra,This is a good time to be on the move but if work and family commitments keep you stuck in one place you can at least make vacation plans for later in the year. Go somewhere exotic, somewhere that excites and inspires you. ,libra,The more so-called experts urge you to take a certain course of action the more wary you should be, especially if they try to convince you there is no way you can lose. Your instincts are telling you a different story. ,libra,You will be incredibly decisive over the next few days but you need to be careful too. The full moon demands that you act for a reason and not merely to impress other people. Save some energy for later in the week. ,libra,This could be a lucky day for you but it could also be the kind of day when what you gain with one hand you squander with the other. If you find you have more cash than you expected put it away for the proverbial rainy day. ,libra,Friends will make all sorts of promises over the next 24 hours but if you expect them to deliver you may be disappointed. They are not trying to cheat or mislead you as such but the simple fact is they have promised too much.
libra,Do what you feel like doing today and ignore those who say you are doing it wrong or that you should be doing more for other people. The fact is you have done your share and have every right to reward yourself with something good.
libra,Work and romance will go well together over the next two or three days – you don’t have to choose between them. Use your Libran charms to influence people in positions of power. Is it fair to do so? Of course it is.
libra,It will pay you to keep your opinions to yourself today, especially on the work front where your know-it-all attitude is unlikely to go down too well. The best way to fall out with powerful people is to make them look stupid. ,libra,Something is wrong and needs to be put right. You know what it is and you know what must be done but do you have the courage to make changes? Of course you do. Librans know that everything must balance out in the end. ,libra,You may get more than you bargained for on the work front this week but you will handle it with ease. Now that Mars is moving in your favor again there is precious little you cannot do – and that applies to your love life too. ,libra,You may be tempted to own up to some kind of indiscretion, simply to get rid of the guilt feelings you have been carrying round, but is that such a good idea? Some things are best not spoken about at all, for everyone’s sake. ,libra,There is no point trying to relax now that Mars, planet of energy, is moving into your fellow Air sign of Gemini. There are so many things you want to do and so many people and places you want to see. Go for it!,libra,Ideas will come thick and fast today but to make the most of them you will have to be selective. You won’t get far if you try to follow up on each and every one of them – it’s simply not possible. Do less, or think less!,libra,Let others take care of you for a change. Life has been tough of late and you deserve a break – in fact you deserve a vacation. You will be working hard again soon enough, so take it easy while you can and don’t feel guilty about it.
libra,Whatever challenges come your way today you will deal with them with ease. This is one of those occasions when you need to be tested, when you need to be pushed to your limits and beyond. And what a Libra needs a Libra gets.
libra,A wonderful link between your ruler Venus and Neptune, planet of imagination, means you will come up with some great ideas this weekend. Some of them may seem a bit outlandish but don’t reject them – they could make you a fortune.
libra,The planets warn you have been far too generous of late. You have given too much of your time, energy and money and now you are beginning to feel the effects. Call a halt now and start building up your reserves again. ,libra,Try not to focus too intently on your own affairs today or you will miss what is going on in the world around you. You can learn a lot from what partners and colleagues say and do, and even more from the mistakes they make. ,libra,You may have strayed a little off course of late but don’t worry about it. What happens today will point you in the right direction and make you realize that you are really not that far away from where you should be.
libra,Put your worries behind you and let a big smile spread across your face. Once the Sun moves into your fellow Air sign of Gemini tomorrow there will be no holding you back – it will be love and laughs all the way.
libra,There were times of late when you did not have the first idea what was going on but now the Sun is moving in your favor again you will see with the utmost clarity – and what you see will most likely delight you.
libra,Someone in a position of authority may be annoying but you need to remember that they have more power than you. You won’t have to agree with every word they say but you will sometimes have to make it look as if you agree.
libra,Be careful that someone you work or do business with does not let you down over the next 48 hours. You don’t have to be too suspicious but you must not let your guard down completely. Anyone who says “trust me” is best avoided. ,libra,This is not the time for second thoughts, still less for regrets. You know what you want, you know where to get it, and you know you can now make a serious play for fame and fortune. Put the past behind you once and for all.
libra,Let others know what is on your mind by all means but don’t say it in a way that might antagonize those you live and work with. Sometimes it is better to approach the truth from an angle rather than confront it head-on.
libra,Do you see things the way they are or the way you would like them to be? That’s an important question because the planets warn you could be a little too optimistic for your own good today. Be positive but be realistic too. ,libra,Do not, under any circumstances, get caught up in a neighborhood dispute today. You may think you know how to resolve the situation, and maybe you do, but they won’t want to listen. Worse, they may join forces and gang up on you.
libra,You may be tempted to tackle ten things at once today so that you can begin to get on top of your workload again but is that a good idea? And is it necessary? Set yourself a sensible schedule and tackle just one thing at a time.
libra,Some people you get along with quite naturally and some people you cannot bring yourself to like no matter what they do to please you. Someone of the latter variety will try to earn your friendship today. You’re not having it.
libra,You will have some pretty good ideas over the next two or three days but with a full moon approaching it’s probably best to hold back from doing much with them just yet. If they are good ideas – and they are – they will last.
libra,The approaching full moon could bring one or two nasty shocks your way but if you stand back and look at them for what they are they won’t cause you too many problems. They are certainly not worth getting worked up about. ,libra,Even if you try to explain yourself in the simplest of terms you will still encounter people who refuse to believe what you say. Don’t waste time trying to persuade them because you have more important, and more exciting, things to do. ,libra,You must not let anyone speak on your behalf today. If you do they will most likely say things you do not agree with, things that could cause trouble. The more controversial your opinions the more you will need to explain them yourself.
libra,You won’t lack for advice today – everyone seems to know what it is you should be doing – but how much of it is good advice? Hardly any of it, according to the planets, so ignore what others say and follow your instincts. ,libra,You are in the mood to shock. You want to see the look of amazement on other people’s faces when you say or do things they don’t approve of. Don’t go too far though or even your friends may start to avoid you. ,libra,Friendships and group activities will go exceedingly well today and over the weekend and even if you are the kind of Libra who enjoys your own company you will want to be where the action is. Some music would be nice too. Party time!,libra,There is something you desperately want to do today but no one else seems interested in your great adventure. Don’t take it as an insult, take it as an opportunity to go your own way and do your own thing. Their loss is your gain. ,libra,Some annoying people are going to be rather disruptive this week and their antics will test even your legendary Libra patience. If you can arrange it at short notice a trip away from your usual environment could be fun, and therapeutic.
libra,You may think you are a law unto yourself and for the time being you can certainly get away with a lot but if you cut too many corners or break too many rules you are sure to create enemies. Don’t be so confrontational.
libra,Someone you usually get along with and agree with will take an opposing viewpoint today and be quite aggressive about it. But so what? Instead of taking it personally just accept that sometimes even the best of friends can fall out. It’s no big deal.
libra,Something you have always believed in will be called into question today but don’t abandon it just yet. It might well be the case that someone is deliberately trying to put doubts in your mind – for their own glory and profit, of course.
libra,You may not be able to explain how you reached a certain conclusion or came up with a certain answer but you know deep inside that it is right, so go with your instincts and don’t let others persuade you to do something different.
libra,You may be reluctant to do too much for someone today as you fear they will become dependent on you, but you are far too nice to turn them away. Just don’t make promises you might be unable or unwilling to keep later on. ,libra,Make it your number one aim to broaden your horizons this weekend, both physically and mentally. The Sun and Mars together in your fellow Air sign of Gemini makes it easier for you to look at the world from a wider perspective. ,libra,For quite some time now you have been pursuing an objective that may have done a lot for your ego but has done little to further your reputation or boost your bank balance. It’s time to get serious. There are bills to be paid.
libra,If you are having doubts about some kind of financial arrangement you must speak up about it. With Saturn moving back into the money area of your chart today you probably have very good reasons for having second thoughts.
libra,Today’s new moon suggests you have been in one place too long and need to move on. Both in your personal affairs and at work you need a bigger challenge, so don’t hang around: get up, get moving and get a better life.
libra,You may have good reasons for wanting to keep certain information from certain individuals but it’s unlikely the planets will let you. Once they know what you know the advantage you held will be gone but you’re still better than they are.
libra,The Sun’s stay in the most adventurous area of your chart ends at the weekend, so make the next few days a time of discovery. Not that you won’t be able to discover things after that but you will have responsibilities to deal with as well.
libra,You will be faced with a rather stiff test today but you have what it takes to come out on top. The planets indicate you can handle anything life throws at you. No matter how tough the test you will sail through with flying colors.
libra,The Sun’s entry into the career area of your chart this weekend will give both your energy and your ambition a boost. Decide what it is you most wish to achieve, focus on it to the exclusion of everything else, then make it happen. ,libra,If someone on the work front annoys you this week – and they will – you must let them know you are not going to put up with it. Is that being too tough? Maybe, but it’s better than not being tough enough. Don’t suffer fools gladly.
libra,People in positions of authority are keeping an eye on you, so make sure they like what they see. Always try to present yourself to the world in a way that highlights the caring side of your nature – then they are more likely to care about you. ,libra,The more certain people warn that you are heading towards disaster the more likely it is that you are heading towards success. Only you know what it is you are aiming for, so don’t let the cynics and critics get you down.
libra,Do not allow anyone to deflect you from the path you have chosen to take. If you let others sow seeds of doubt in your mind between now and the weekend your chances of success will diminish. Ignore the critics and believe in yourself. ,libra,Libra is a cardinal sign, which means you like to compete, and with Mars moving through the career area of your chart you are in no mood to take prisoners. A word of warning: know your limits. Don’t start fights you cannot possibly win. ,libra,With mind planet Mercury moving through the area of your chart that governs, among other things, long-distance travel, you won’t be short of offers to expand your horizons. Accept each and every one of them. Adventure is your middle name.
libra,Forget about the few things that have gone wrong recently and focus on the many things that are still going right. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your workplace relationships. You are held in high esteem by your colleagues. ,libra,This is not a good time to make far-reaching decisions regarding your family or your career. The simple fact is you will be too emotional to think straight this week, so focus on more enjoyable matters and leave the serious stuff for another day – or another year!,libra,Don’t make any important decisions concerning your domestic situation or your career aims until the approaching full moon begins to wane towards the end of the week. It is highly unlikely you will be thinking straight between now and then. ,libra,You may feel that you can take on the world and win and to a certain extent it’s true but there are still some people it would be wise to avoid. Someone in a position of authority is looking for an excuse to cut you down in size.
libra,It may be tempting to tell friends and relatives what they want to hear today but you must call it as you see it. With Venus, your ruler, so well positioned at the moment no matter what you say others will see the sense in it.
libra,You are strongly advised to make the most of the Sun in the career area of your chart this weekend. Aim to do something out of the ordinary, something that convinces employers and other important people you have what it takes.
libra,Your wit and flair will come to the fore over the next seven days and just about everyone you meet will be impressed by your confident, can-do attitude. It may be an act but it’s a good one, so live it and profit from it.
libra,There is an urgency about you at the moment, no doubt due to the influence of Pluto, planet of power. You know if you pass up an opportunity to better yourself it will be a very long time, if ever, before it comes round again.
libra,This is a busy week for those born under the sign of the Scales, so pace yourself sensibly and be selective in your goals. If you throw yourself at every new challenge that comes your way your energy will soon disappear. ,libra,Reach out and make contact with someone in a position of authority today, As Mercury, your ruler, crosses into the career area of your chart you clearly know what it is you want and how to get it. You’re going places!,libra,You don’t lack for compassion but how about common sense? The planets warn that over the next few days you could easily be fooled into thinking that you are doing the right thing, when the real right thing is to leave well alone.
libra,No matter how hungry you are for fame and fortune you must not cut corners or take liberties. If you want success to last you must make sure it has strong foundations. Oh, and make sure there are no embarrassing skeletons hiding in your closet!,libra,You won’t lack for opportunities to make your mark this weekend – in fact you will attract them to you in some strange cosmic way. But don’t fall into the trap of trying to take advantage of each and every offer that comes along. Be selective.
libra,Don’t waste time trying to persuade people that what you are about to do is right. You should have enough confidence in yourself to just do it and not worry about what others think. Some will like it and some will hate it. So what? ,libra,Don’t try too hard to make a name for yourself over the next few days because the planets warn you could end up with a name you don’t like. You don’t have to keep a low profile but you do have to play by the rules. ,libra,You prefer to avoid confrontation but the planets suggest you will find the courage to make the kind of difficult decision that you usually strive to avoid. Remember: change is not something you should shun but something you should welcome.
libra,You are in one of your brutally honest moods and anyone of a sensitive disposition had best stay out of your way. Be careful who you criticize though. Some people have the power to make life difficult for you – and they will.
libra,You may be easygoing by nature but you are also ambitious and today’s new moon will give you the courage to stand up and take charge. What happens over the next 24 hours could change the working course of your life dramatically.
libra,There is still time to do something dramatic, something that impresses those in positions of power, so get to it. You may not want to be the center of attention but it goes with the territory. You can’t be half famous.
libra,You are now making serious progress towards your goals but you also need to reward yourself with some down time. With Venus moving into the most sensitive area of your chart this weekend spend some time with the one you love most – yourself!,libra,You want to feel that you are doing something useful with your life and the good news is you will get the chance to help other people when the Sun changes signs in midweek. Just remember you can’t do it all on your own. Be a team player. ,libra,Recent weeks have not been easy but they have certainly toughened you up and that’s good. When the Sun and Mercury change signs on Thursday you will be in a position to turn your experiences to your long-term advantage. ,libra,What you need to recognize today is that you are entitled to your beliefs and opinions. You are certainly under no obligation to submit to cross examination from people whose perspective on life is the opposite of your own. Trust yourself. ,libra,You seem to be in a rebellious mood at the moment. Whatever others say you take the opposite view, simply because it is fun to do so. Just make sure you don’t annoy someone whose support you will need in the very near future.
libra,Some people have been rather critical of you in recent weeks but over the next few days you will be able to show that you were right and they were wrong. They won’t thank you for it, of course, but you will be smiling. ,libra,How can you be sure that others are telling you the truth? You can’t, but according to the planets you should not worry about it because even if they are lying to you no real harm will come of it. Focus on affairs of the heart this weekend. ,libra,How can you be sure that others are telling you the truth? You can’t, but according to the planets you should not worry about it because even if they are lying to you no real harm will come of it. Focus on affairs of the heart this weekend.
libra,You may be tempted to force through changes this week, and you have the power to do so, but what’s the point if it upsets so many people? Libra is supposed to be the sign of compromise, so find a middle way that everyone can agree to.
libra,If there is something you have wanted to do for years but for one reason or another never quite go around to, now is the time to get your act together and show the world you mean business. All the waiting will have been worth it.
libra,Not only are you in tune with the spirit of the times but you believe you have at last found your special place and role in the world at large. It’s good to feel you are doing something worthwhile. It’s good to make a difference.
libra,The approaching full moon will revive your interest in something you appeared to give up on six months or so ago. Will you get serious about it this time? It’s an all-or-nothing situation: either give it everything or leave it alone. ,libra,The most important thing now is that you act as if you care, even if you don’t. Others are counting on you to raise their spirits and if you are as nice a person as they say you are you will tell them what they need to hear.
libra,You won’t find it easy to keep your feelings under control today, not with a full moon in your fellow Air sign of Aquarius. You will later look back and wonder what got into you but whatever it was you will have to admit it was fun!,libra,For some strange reason you seem to believe that you have fallen short of what was expected of you. In one or two things that may be true but in most things it is not, so stop talking yourself down. A positive attitude is a must.
libra,There is an air of anticipation. You can sense that something dramatic is going to happen. What that something might be is anyone’s guess but if you keep your head you will be the first to benefit from any changes that take place.
libra,You are cluttering up your life with too many possessions, as well as people you no longer need. What happens over the next few days will give you a golden opportunity to get rid of them all, but you cannot afford to be sentimental about it. ,libra,You are more likely to reach the top of your chosen profession if you are prepared to work as part of a team rather than try to do everything yourself. Share the workload today – you will still enjoy the lion’s share of the glory.
libra,Money matters of one kind or another have been a source of both joy and despair in recent weeks but now Saturn is moving in your favor again you can see clearly what needs to be done to return to profitable ways. So do it.
libra,You don’t have to do anything special to make this a special day, you just have to be yourself and enjoy the wonderful things that come your way. It’s possible you could go on a spree and spend too much money but that’s nothing new.
libra,You are spending too much time and energy on something that is of no real importance. Your most important task over the next 48 hours is to get your priorities in the right order. If you don’t, the planets may force it on you.
libra,Intense cosmic goings on in the area of your chart that governs group activities will inspire you to get more deeply involved in causes and issues in the wider world. You must work with others if you want to change the world.
libra,Don’t worry too much if your efforts fall short of the mark over the next few days because you need to slow down and take things easy for a while. Chances are you have not stopped to draw breath for quite some time, so go easy on yourself. ,libra,Some habits are easy to break but the habit you are struggling with at the moment seems too deep-rooted to overcome. Maybe you should stop trying so hard and instead find ways to enjoy it. A change of attitude may be all you need.
libra,You seem to be finding it hard to put your thoughts into words at the moment but it could work in your favor as it means you are less likely to give away any secrets that should be kept to yourself. You know how much you like to gossip!,libra,This is a good time to look back at your efforts over the past few months and learn from both your triumphs and your failures. Your attitude is so positive now that nothing can hurt you emotionally, so be brutally honest with yourself. ,libra,Something you have been looking forward to may have to be put back a day or two, maybe even until the start of next week, but later you will realize the delay was a blessing in disguise. It seems a little more preparation is needed.
libra,The only reason you fear something is because you don’t understand it. Today’s new moon will help you to overcome your fear by finding out more about what is causing you so much anxiety. As they say: the only thing to fear is fear itself.
libra,Today’s Sun-Venus link is good for group activities but because Venus is moving retrograde at the moment you would be wise not to sign up to anything you cannot easily get out of. Maybe some things are not quite as simple as they seem. ,libra,Libra is a likeable sign but you have rivals and enemies like everyone else and the planets warn there is someone you must watch out for over the next few days. Be careful who you trust, especially on the work front. Not all is as it seems. ,libra,You need to scale down your ambitions a bit. If you don’t the planets warn you risk overdoing it and damaging your health. Don’t think of it as giving up things you like, think of it as making more room for things you love.
libra,If something positive happens today – and it will – it could have a negative side to it as well. And if something bad happens it could also be positive in some way. As a well balanced Libra you will, of course, take it all in your stride.
libra,The harder you try not to be anxious about something the more it will prey on your mind and the more likely it is your day will be spoiled. There is nothing that can be done about it now, so focus on things that make you smile.
libra,You may find a work colleague unusually obstructive today, but don’t cross them off your friendship list just yet because the planets suggest it is not their fault. They too are coming under pressure from people further up the hierarchy. Stay cool. ,libra,You should be making plans that stretch well into the future – not weeks and months but years and decades. You need a vision, something to aim for, something to inspire you. The details can be sorted out later, it’s the big picture that matters now.
libra,For a long time now you have been kidding yourself that a project of some kind will come right in the end but what happens over the next 48 hours will finally convince you to get real. There is no disgrace in admitting you were wrong.
libra,You may not understand some of the things that are going on around you at the moment but who says you have to? You may be curious by nature but you don’t have to solve each and every mystery. Why take the magic out of life?,libra,You may be in a panic and try to get everything done in a mad rush as the week begins. Not only is that unnecessary but it could be counter-productive as well. Focus on one goal at a time and don’t move to the next until it is reached. ,libra,A rethink of your aims may be a good idea but don’t change anything before getting advice from people you know you can trust. You are a little confused at the moment and it might be the case that you don’t have to change anything at all.
libra,Something you were hoping would remain a secret will be brought into the open today but it won’t be as embarrassing as you feared it would be. In fact you may be surprised to find that no one cares in the slightest. ,libra,Your sixth sense tells you that something big is going to happen over the next few days but there is no need to get anxious about it. Whatever comes your way, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you will make the most of it. ,libra,Because you feel vulnerable at the moment you may be inclined to think there is a hidden catch to what you are now being offered. You could not, in fact, be more wrong, so go for it or you could miss out on something good.
libra,If you must poke your nose into other people’s business this weekend at least make it look as if you are genuinely interested in their welfare. If you give the impression that you are prying for the fun of it you may get a difficult reception.
libra,Someone you thought you knew very well will surprise you and do something that shocks you over the next few days. The signs have been there for quite some time but you rarely notice how deceptive others can be. You’re far too trusting.
libra,You may get a bit touchy today if someone you thought was on your side makes a big deal out of some minor mistake you made. What you have to realize is that from their point of view it is a much bigger mistake. Don’t overreact. ,libra,The good times just keep getting better and with your ruler Venus linked to action planet Mars today everything will work out for the best. Yes, you are free to do as you please without fear of the consequences – within reason, of course.
libra,Forget about your chores for a while and go out and do something that makes you feel alive. The most important thing is that your mood is positive, because then and only then will you make a good job of what you are working on.
libra,You are torn between the future and the past and must find ways to bring them together. The best way, of course, is to learn from what has gone before and make sure you don’t make the same mistakes all over again.
libra,You must trust your instincts today, even if everyone else seems to be moving in a different direction to you. Sometimes logic is not the best guide to what should be done and sometimes it pays not to follow the herd.
libra,You must make an important decision this weekend, the kind of decision that could change your life. So long as you make it in accordance with what you believe and what you desire it is sure to be a change for the better. ,libra,You may need to rely on someone this week who has let you down before. Do you give them another chance? According to the planets you should because with Venus, your ruler, moving in your favor again they are eager to make it up to you. ,libra,The Sun in the most sensitive area of your chart means that not everything will run according to plan this week, but whatever goes wrong don’t take it too seriously. That famous Libra sense of balance will keep you out of harm’s way.
libra,The world needs people who are not afraid to turn their ideals into action and if you take a stand on an important issue today you will find that other people rally to your cause. Make this the day that you start to make a difference. ,libra,You need to confront and then deal with those nagging doubts and secret fears that have been holding you back for so long. The more anxious you are the harder it becomes to think clearly, so maybe it’s time to get tough with yourself.
libra,Attitude is everything. With the right mental outlook you will find ways to turn all events in your favor, even those which, on the surface at least, seem to be acting against your interests. Think positive and success is guaranteed.
libra,You can and you must overcome your fears this weekend, because if you don’t you may one day regret it. There is only one thing you need to be afraid of and that is the possibility that you will fail to live up to your true potential.
libra,The planets will inspire you to shake things up a bit over the next seven days and you may even say and do things you don’t really believe in. Just be careful you don’t get stuck with a reputation as a rabble-rouser or a rebel!,libra,Try not to criticize yourself for no good reason. In fact, try not to criticize yourself even if there is a good reason. If you made a mistake of some kind then learn from it quickly and move on. Today’s failure can be tomorrow’s success.
libra,Something you thought was a permanent part of your world will disappear today but there is no need to feel sad about it. On the contrary, by creating a space in your life you will encourage something even better to come in and fill it. ,libra,Mercury, the planet of the mind, in your sign makes this the ideal time to get your head around what you need to change to make your life more complete. You must be practical though – don’t let idle daydreams lead you astray.
libra,There is no reason why you should beat yourself up about something that went wrong. If you indulge your emotions too much you may lose sight of all the good things you have to be thankful for. Make a list of them today.
libra,You will meet a deadline by the skin of your teeth this weekend. You could, of course, finish it in half the time and with half the effort too if you were to draw up a plan and stick to it, but where’s the fun in that?,libra,When the Sun moves into your birth sign on Tuesday you will get a new lease of life. Before then, however, it might be a good idea to review the successes and failures of the past few months. Most importantly, what can you learn about yourself? ,libra,There are so many new things you want to do but, for one reason or another, you have not been able to make a start on them. When the Sun enters your sign on Wednesday you will at last get the green light. Are you ready for it?,libra,No matter how persuasive you may be with other people you can no longer fool yourself that things can stay as they are. Both at work and in your private life there will have to be changes. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will make it happen.
libra,The Sun’s move into your sign today makes all things possible. It will certainly give new life to a project or quest of some sort and if you reach for your highest ideal you will make the kind of difference that changes the world for the better. ,libra,A whole new chapter in your life has now begun and in a matter of days you will have forgotten about recent worries and woes. The plans you make today, tomorrow and over the weekend will set you on a more exciting course through life.
libra,You will clash with someone whose views and opinions you completely disagree with today or over the weekend and you must not back down. It is unlikely you will find common ground, so go all out to win the argument right from the start. ,libra,Any upheavals that take place over the next few days – and there will be more than a few – will benefit you in ways you had not expected. All you need to do is stay alert and be ready to take advantage. Fate is very much on your side.
libra,Some people will be difficult to deal with over the next few days, of that there is no doubt, but it is how you choose to react that matters most. You cannot change the way they are but you can decide not to let them get under your skin. ,libra,So many good things are happening now but you must not take your luck for granted. Today’s lunar eclipse will in some way or other remind you how easy it is for things to fall apart. Not that they will, but it’s a timely warning.
libra,You should be making serious progress towards your goals now and if you are not then you need to ask yourself if maybe some of your methods need improving. And don’t let retrograde Mercury undermine your confidence – go for it!,libra,You can, if you wish, force your views and opinions on other people but it won’t do you much good in the long term. No matter how persuasive and powerful you are today others will switch back to their old ways and beliefs tomorrow. ,libra,What happens today will hopefully convince you that some things are best left in the realms of fantasy. Having a dream is one thing but what if, when it comes true, you find it is really a nightmare? Stick to reality, it’s safer.
libra,You are beginning to believe that your luck really has changed and that you are on the verge of something amazing – and you’re right, you are. Keep dreaming about a brighter future – and keep doing the everyday things that will make it happen. ,libra,You need to let go of the past and you also need to stop blaming your misfortunes on fate or, worse, on other people. Only one individual is responsible for what happens in your life and that individual is you. Take charge of your future.
libra,If you don’t feel like socializing or traveling or communicating over the next few days, then don’t. With Venus, your ruler, moving into the most sensitive area of your chart you will probably want to spend some time alone. It’s your choice.
libra,You will find it easier to express yourself when Mercury turns direct in your sign towards the end of the week. Between now and then though keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself. You don’t have to let everyone know your desires.
libra,Be careful you don’t go too far today because with power planet Pluto so strong in your chart your efforts to make a name for yourself could cause problems. You don’t have to keep a low profile but you do have to do everything by the book. ,libra,If your energy level seems a bit low today don’t push yourself too hard. Mars in the most sensitive area of your chart means if you double your efforts the returns are likely to be lower than you expected. Don’t worry, you will catch up later. ,libra,For some strange reason you are still taking certain things personally when, in reality, they have nothing to do with you at all. You need to get over yourself and get past the notion that the powers that be are ganging up on you. They’re not. ,libra,Things that did not add up a while ago now make perfect sense and no doubt you will kick yourself mentally for making it so complicated when it did not need to be. No matter. Even a Libra gets confused now and again. ,libra,You need to bring your thoughts down to earth and start looking at ways you can make your life more comfortable financially. Big ideas are all very well but like everyone else you have to pay the bills, so think of ways to make more money. ,libra,You will be in a rebellious mood over the next few days and will most likely upset a few people. But that’s okay. It seems to be your responsibility at the moment to disrupt the accepted way of doing things. It’s time for old habits to end. ,libra,There is always something new to learn and today’s Sun-Uranus link will help you make sense of something that previously made no sense at all. What happens will change the way you look at the world. The world will look at you with new eyes too.
libra,Don’t give up on something just because it is proving difficult. Today’s new moon in your sign indicates that if you stick it out a little longer you will get the breakthrough you have been hoping for. Smile more too – somehow it always helps. ,libra,At this time of year, when the Sun is in your sign, you tend to push yourself hard, but other influences warn that if you go beyond your natural limits today you may regret it tomorrow. You will reach your destination, but give it time.
libra,You already know the answers to certain questions, so why are you still seeking other people’s opinions? It is part of the Libra nature to look at all possibilities before making a decision but sometimes you can take it too far!,libra,If you want something enough you will no doubt find a way to get it, but you will get it quicker and easier if you start thinking in terms of cooperation rather than conflict. There is only so much you can accomplish on your own.
libra,If you owe someone a favor you will be called upon to repay it this weekend. No matter how busy you are and no matter how much it might cost, you are strongly advised to do so immediately and with a very big smile. ,libra,The Sun leaves your birth sign on the 23rd, which means you still have a few days to get serious about that project you have been toying with. Alternatively, you could change your plans completely and start something new. It’s up to you. ,libra,The planets indicate that if you trust your instincts and follow your hunches over the next few days you can and you will accomplish great things. Anything of a creative nature is especially well starred, so make the most of your talents.
libra,You must not allow yourself to get emotional about something that needs to be dealt with on a purely mental level. If you allow your feelings to get the better of you then you will not only confuse other people but also yourself.
libra,There are people in your social circle who envy you for your popularity and are plotting to make you look bad in some way. It’s unlikely they will succeed but be on your guard anyway. Watch out for those who flatter you too much. ,libra,Don’t worry if something important is going out of your life because something even better is sure to come in to replace it over the next few days. Everything in life tends to balance itself out: a Libra of all people should know that. ,libra,You have been trying hard to impress someone in a position of authority but there is really no need. They know what you can do and will go out of their way to help you both professionally and financially. They can see you are amazing. ,libra,With Venus, your ruler, linked with expansive Jupiter this weekend you won’t be short of big ideas and big dreams but you are advised to keep them to yourself for the time being. Don’t give your rivals information they can use against you. ,libra,If you have gone over the top with your cash or your credit cards in recent weeks you will have to make sacrifices to make up for it now. Also, if you are having second thoughts about a deal of some kind you MUST get it sorted soon. ,libra,Act as if you care about what is going on around you, even if you don’t. That might sound callous but the fact is that although other people’s struggles may not be your struggles you will only get where you want to go if you pretend they are. ,libra,If you are a bit too easygoing with money today you may regret it later on, so rein in your extravagant tastes and opt for the simple (and free) things that life has to offer. Your resources are limited, and precious, so don’t waste them. ,libra,Don’t let what is going on around you today distract you from your number one aim, which is to make money. Over the next two or three days you will get the chance to earn some big bucks but you have got to stay focused. ,libra,After the trials and tribulations of the past few days what happens over the next 24 hours will be more to your liking. You may even receive news of a windfall that solves a financial problem. Will it stop your reckless spending habits? Probably not.
libra,This will be a rather quiet time by your standards but in a way that’s good because you have a lot to think about. The more you reflect upon your goals now the more likely it is you will reach them in the near future.
libra,Get promises in writing this weekend because if you leave anything to chance it is odds-on that someone will try to cheat you. You have put a lot of time and effort into what you’ve been working on, so make sure you get your reward.
libra,Someone in a position of authority may not want to see you succeed but no way can they stop you. You have the talent to reach the top without their help and they know it – which is the reason why they fear you so much. ,libra,Keep a tight hold of your cash over the next few days because the planets warn there will be a lot of temptations. If you go over the top financially now you could regret it for weeks, maybe even months, to come, so be careful.
libra,You will be assessing your life in some depth over the next 24 hours and some of the conclusions you reach will surprise you. You may see yourself as a thinking person but it is your emotions you should pay more attention to now.
libra,The best way to deal with setbacks, both in your personal life and at work, is to greet them with a smile and show those around you that you are not in the least bit worried. It may not be true but pretend that it is.
libra,Avoid situations where you do not feel in control of events. And avoid people whose main aim in life seems to be controlling you. You are a free spirit and you are entitled to come and go as you please, today and every day.
libra,Someone who can usually be counted on to support you with no questions asked will wonder aloud today if you know what you are doing. You do, of course, but it might be worth your while to ask them why they no longer have faith in you. ,libra,You may not want to move with the times but what choice do you have? Fortunately, as Venus, your ruler, moves into your sign this weekend you won’t find it hard to make necessary changes. Remember, life is all about love and laughter. ,libra,You need to make peace with someone who seems to have become an enemy. The more time you have to spend looking over your shoulder worrying about what they are up to the less time you will have for more interesting things, like making money.
libra,You don’t usually lack for confidence but you seem to be finding it harder than usual to believe in yourself. Think again about plans that you made to travel or socialize because you really need to spend some time by yourself now.
libra,Your confidence may be high at the moment but don’t take too much for granted. This is a great time for making plans but you must also remember to be flexible as even the best laid plans sometimes have to be changed at the last moment.
libra,You have accomplished a lot in recent months and there is a lot more you can achieve between now and the end of the year. Your success will be greater if you consciously limit your goals. You don’t have to do it all right now. ,libra,Mars moving into your sign today means it is time to get active. You have done all the thinking and planning you need – now you must knuckle down, work hard and start getting ahead in whatever field of endeavor you wish to make your mark.
libra,Your self-belief may have taken a hammering of late but as from today you will be back to your best. But don’t go from one extreme to the other and start believing that nothing can go wrong. Over-confidence could lead to disaster.
libra,You may be feeling a bit defensive at the moment but with Mars now moving through your sign it won’t be long before you are back to your best. This weekend though be wary of people who try to encourage you to “invest” your money. ,libra,Don’t focus too rigidly on one specific task over the coming week because your mind does not want to be tied down. This is one of those times when you will do better, and feel happier, if you follow your fancy day by day.
libra,Something will happen over the next 24 hours that disrupts your routine but there is no point getting upset about it. Go with the flow and believe that fate knows what is right for you. Everything will work out for the best in the end. ,libra,Keep your overall goal in mind and don’t be distracted by things which, while interesting, take you away from the path you should be on. There will be time for fun and games and other diversions later on, when the serious stuff has been done.
libra,If you decide to do something on the spur of the moment today it will turn out to be a lot of fun, although maybe not everyone will approve of what you are up to. But, of course, you’re a Libra – you enjoy being different. ,libra,You don’t have to make money the center of your universe today and over the weekend but you do have to make sure you get what you deserve. You have worked long and hard to reach your current position – don’t let others take the benefits from you.
libra,You will be pleased by financial news of some sort this weekend. Maybe you will come into money or maybe you will discover you are not as deeply in debt as you feared but whatever the reason your cashflow situation – and your mood – will improve. ,libra,Go where you want to go and do want you want to do this week, because no one is going to stop you. The full moon on Wednesday may bring a brief interruption to your wanderings but it won’t be for long. You’ve just got to be free. ,libra,If the atmosphere in a relationship has been a bit heavy of late you will get the chance to improve things today. No matter what they may have said or done you must put that behind you and focus on the simple things that make your bond work. ,libra,Your confidence will soar over the next few days and with both Mars and Venus moving through your sign a breakthrough of some kind cannot be far away. It may not get this good again for a while, so make the most of it. ,libra,The full moon may prevent you from getting out and about as much as you would like to today but don’t let that stop you from communicating with family and friends. Thanks to the telephone and the internet no-one can hide from you. ,libra,You will want to be on the move today. On some deep inner level you realize that you will achieve more if you get out and about and meet as many new people as you possibly can. Don’t wait for opportunity to come knocking – go looking for it.
libra,Mars in your sign gives you the courage to take risks but they are more likely to pay off if you allow yourself to be guided by what your inner voice is trying to tell you. The more you listen the more you will accomplish – it’s that simple. ,libra,No matter how pressed you are for time this weekend you must connect with your nearest and dearest. Certain domestic issues can no longer be swept under the carpet, so be honest about what you think and how you feel and invite them to be honest too. ,libra,The planets will make it easy to charm your way past others’ defenses and make them believe that it is in their own interests to do what they can to assist you. It may or may not be true but even if it isn’t they can’t help but enjoy your company.
libra,Think positive and pay attention only to those things that matter to you personally. If you let your mind wander you will lose focus and maybe lose out to a rival who does not possess your abilities but does know the value of concentration. ,libra,You have pushed yourself hard in recent weeks and have accomplished a lot but now you need to take life at a less frenzied pace for a while. There may be a thousand and one things that need doing but you don’t have to do them all yourself. ,libra,With Venus and Mars, the relationship planets, moving through your sign you must let those you care for know how much they mean to you. Do it now because Venus leaves your sign at the weekend. It’s no hardship to say “I love you.” ,libra,If life seems a bit too tame at the moment it could be because you are not setting yourself targets that test your abilities. It’s fun to drift along without worrying but already you are getting bored with the easy life. Time to get serious. ,libra,This is not a good time to make hasty decisions, especially if you are the kind of Libra who likes to make social and travel plans on the spur of the moment. What seems like such a good idea now may seem very different by this time tomorrow.
libra,You seem to have strayed a long way from your original intentions and need to get yourself back on track. Make it your aim this weekend to stand back from what you are working on and reacquaint yourself with your long-term objectives.
libra,You may think you have a right to say what you please, and maybe you do, but that does not mean there won’t be consequences. Mars in your sign could make you dangerously assertive, especially when dealing with people who enjoy a good fight. ,libra,Money and status may be important to you but no matter how successful you are the most important things in life are your relationships and what happens today will in some way or other remind you of that fact. You are rich in love and that’s what counts.
libra,If you don’t much feel like working today then don’t force yourself. According to the planets there is no point starting anything too detailed. If possible, keep your powder dry until the new moon comes round on Friday. Then and only then will your enthusiasm return. ,libra,You may spend too much time doing things for other people today when you should really be doing more things for yourself. Find ways to cut back on your commitments without making it seem as if you are abandoning friends and loved ones. ,libra,There is someone you should be seeing more of and with Mercury moving into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart today this is the ideal time to ring them up and arrange to get together again. Don’t drift apart so easily in future. ,libra,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs your ability to communicate makes it easy for you to win people over to your way of thinking. Make use of that ability today to get others to do the small stuff while you focus on the big picture.
libra,If you help others this weekend they will help you. If, on the other hand, you make excuses and make yourself scarce in their moment of need you yourself will find assistance hard to come by. What goes around comes around, sometimes sooner than we expect.
libra,You will move up in the estimation of important people over the next few days, not least because they appreciate your ability to come up with solutions that everyone else has overlooked. It won’t be long before you’re important too.
libra,Some people may say that you are losing your edge, that you are not as decisive and dynamic as you used to be, but it isn’t true. Even a Libra is entitled to relax once in a while and there is no doubt that you will bounce back soon.
libra,Do you carry on along your present course or do you change direction and try something different? Only you can decide but it might help to talk it over with friends and family first. They can see your situation from a less personal perspective. ,libra,Don’t turn down a promising offer just because you are not sure you are up to the job. Someone in a position of authority would not have approached you unless they thought you were the kind of person who could grow into it quickly. So get growing! ,libra,If you find that your energy goes into a nose-dive today then you must stop what you are doing and take a much-needed break. Each hour you push yourself beyond your limits will require at least a day to recover. Be kind to yourself. ,libra,You may be missing out on a number of opportunities, simply because you are too stubborn to admit that your present course is taking you in the wrong direction. There is still time, just, to change your mind and get back on track. ,libra,Mars in your sign gives you no end of energy and ambition but don’t take too many risks. Your efforts to impress people in positions of power could easily backfire over the next 48 hours. Shouldn’t they be trying to impress you?,libra,The Sun’s entry into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart over the next few days may make you feel a bit lost but don’t worry – Mars in your sign will soon snap you out of your negative mood. Life is still good.
libra,You have something to hide and will go to any lengths to keep others from discovering the truth. Eventually, of course, it will all come out, so why not own up to your mistake, pay the penalty and move on. Honesty is by far the best policy. ,libra,As from today you will feel a lot more positive about what kind of person you are and what kind of things you should be doing in your life. If you feel yourself pulled in a new direction don’t let others talk you out of it.
libra,You will surprise yourself today and do something that scares you. The good news is you might just make a success of it. The even better news is that even if you don’t you will still impress people in positions of power. They admire your spirit.
libra,If you want to make changes it should be easy enough to do, but because the current full moon cuts across such an important axis of your chart you must make sure it’s what you really want. You won’t be able to change back again later.
libra,Popularity seems to be your middle name at the moment, and that’s nice, but don’t let it go to your head. The planets warn that some of the people saying nice things about you don’t really believe them – and that suggests they are up to something.
libra,Don’t worry if you discover that someone you thought was a friend has been talking behind your back. Ignore what others may or may not be saying about you and just do what feels right. There is absolutely nothing they can do to stop you. ,libra,Over the next few days you will find you get a more balanced view of what is taking place in the world. If an authority figure tries to tell you that certain opinions are not allowed, tell them to get lost. Think and speak as you please.
libra,If you are the kind of Libra who enjoys organizing social events and getting involved in causes of one sort or another you will enjoy yourself today. Even if you are not that kind of Libra, aim to be one. What you do with others will be fun.
libra,Most of the time you are cautious about what you say but sometimes you go right the other way and leave others open-mouthed with astonishment that you could be so outspoken and outrageous. Think before you speak over the next 24 hours. ,libra,You will go out of your way today to explain something to those whose minds don’t seem able to grasp the significance of what is going on. It will be worth the effort when they see the light and you can communicate on the same wavelength.
libra,You will be even more adventurous than you usually are as the old year ends and the new year begins. Maybe it’s because you can sense that Mars will shortly be leaving your sign. Make as much fuss and noise as you possibly can. ,libra,Don’t hesitate to act on your ideas. Always believe that you can do more and do better. Above all make use of Mars before it leaves your sign on Sunday. Finish what you started then begin something new. Think big. Talk big. Act big.
libra,As mind planet Mercury moves into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend you are sure to be more confident than usual. But don’t let confidence become cockiness or you could come a cropper when Mercury turns retrograde on Tuesday. ,libra,You will get the chance to do more on a material level over the next few days. You will certainly get the chance to earn more, though you must also remember that where work and business matters are concerned it is quality that counts.
libra,A more positive phase will begin later in the month when the Sun moves into your fellow Air sign of Aquarius but before then you must get both your family and financial houses in order. What you change now will determine how much fun you have later. ,libra,You will get the chance to make some serious money over the next few days, but you could also lose some serious money if you get carried away and start thinking you cannot possibly fail. Is there a hidden catch? According to the planets there may be.
libra,If someone needs your help today you must give it with no questions asked. A deed done with no thought for your own reward will do no end of good. There is only one way to change the world and that is to be nice to everyone you meet. ,libra,There is no need to push yourself harder or faster, even though certain people may be urging you to do so. In fact the planets say you should sit back, take things easy and watch the passing parade. You’re entitled to some down time now and again.
libra,No matter what your worries and woes might have been in recent weeks you feel a lot happier now. You will feel happier still if you make an effort to get out and about. Travel and social activities will go well for you over the next 48 hours. ,libra,Focus on the good things in your life and pretend that the bad things do not exist. Yes, it may be wishful thinking but you should know by now that if your thoughts are positive then positive things are more likely to happen, so ignore your fears.
libra,The planets are not only boosting your creativity at the moment but also your confidence. Now what you need to do is find ways to help loved ones who are not feeling as good about life as you are. With your assistance they will soon be smiling again.
libra,Don’t take what you are told at face value today – check the facts for yourself. What friends, relatives and work colleagues say may sound convincing but if you do some digging you will realize you are only being told part of a much bigger story. ,libra,If you need to make changes on the home front then get on with it now. In fact the planets warn if you don’t take control someone else will, so get busy and start guiding events, and people, in the direction that you want them to go. ,libra,You must be honest with others about your feelings today. If you don’t deal with bad emotions now they will hold you back later on. If you are going to work as a team you need to get past the personal stuff quickly. ,libra,There is no reason to hold back: give it all you’ve got and show the world what you are capable of. If you have been thinking about changing job or location now is the time to do something about it. Time to awaken that Libra spirit of adventure.
libra,Because Libra is a cardinal sign you like to take the lead but don’t expect others to follow you blindly. If you want them to back what you are doing you must convince them not only that it’s good for you but good for them too. ,libra,You have spent a lot of time and energy keeping other people happy of late and no doubt you are growing tired of being the one who makes all the sacrifices. Don’t worry. The Sun’s change of signs on Wednesday means it’s your turn to be waited on.
libra,Changes of one sort or another are inevitable but the good news is they will work in your favor. It may be annoying that travel and social plans have to be changed at the last minute but you can easily make new arrangements. Be flexible.
libra,The Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart tomorrow, so start thinking ahead now because you will accomplish more if you have a clear idea what goal it is you are trying to reach. Aim to do what others say cannot be done.
libra,Whatever crises you’ve had to deal with of late you can now forget all about them. A new set of cosmic influences will provide you with no end of opportunities to show the world that you are back to your best. Nothing keeps a Libra down for long.
libra,You will be rather excitable today and the smallest thing will set you off. You won’t know yourself which way you are going to jump next, so don’t be surprised if others, even those you are closest to emotionally, stay out of your way. ,libra,There is no point aiming for perfection because you will never reach it. All you can do is aim to be the best at what you do and to be happy with that. Set yourself new goals and make sure they are goals that you can live with.
libra,Go along with what a friend suggests today, even if you think it’s not a good idea. If you express your doubts so early they are likely to blame you if and when it all falls apart. That may be unfair but since when have people been reasonable?,libra,Loved ones and work colleagues will be demanding this week, so you must plan your time carefully and decide in advance what you are, and are not, willing to do. Somewhere along the line you will have to say “no” – or risk getting run into the ground. ,libra,Come and go as you please today and ignore those who don’t like it. No one has the right to dictate where you should be going or what you should be doing with your time or your energy – though it won’t stop them trying.
libra,The Sun in Aquarius is sure to bring something good your way, most likely as a reward for all the efforts you have made and all the risks you have taken. Also, this is one of the best times of the year to start something new.
libra,You will get a lot done in a relatively short space of time today. Social and romantic activities loom large in your chart over the next few days, so get on top of your workload now and devote the remainder of the week to having fun. ,libra,Libra is a cardinal sign, which means you are willing to fight for what you believe in, and that’s good because you will be challenged by someone who disagrees strongly with your opinions today. Don’t give them an inch – there is no middle ground.
libra,The only reason someone is giving you a hard time is because they are under the impression that you can be pushed around. No matter what created that impression you must uncreate it today. Get tough and give them a taste of their own medicine. ,libra,The solution to a problem that has been bugging you for ages is now glaringly obvious and you wonder why you did not see it before. Not even a Libra can get it right every time but you will get it right now if you trust your instincts.
libra,If things are a bit too slow for your liking then do something about it. Don’t wait for others to take the initiative, take it yourself and make things happen. Not everyone will be pleased that you are shaking things up but you won’t care about that!,libra,Is it worth trying to control each and every situation you find yourself in? Probably not. At some point today you will realize it is better to let fate take its chosen course than struggle to steer it in a direction more to your liking. ,libra,It is unlikely that you will be thinking too clearly today and if you let your fears get the better of you it could have costly implications. The more someone tells you that you need to act fast or miss out altogether the more suspicious you should be.
libra,There is a task that needs finishing and you must be quick about it because come the weekend time will run out. Make an extra special effort to move it forward today – you may be surprised how quickly and easily it all fits together. ,libra,It may be hard to think straight today but it’s essential if you don’t want to get caught up in the kind of emotional scenes that most people seek to avoid. You cannot stop others ranting and raving and making a scene but you don’t have to join in. ,libra,You feel good about yourself at the moment and you should be using that feeling to create something substantial in your life. Both in your personal affairs and in your work you will get the chance to do some remarkable things over the next few days.
libra,Some people will get rather emotional over the next 48 hours. There is no point trying to appeal to their reason because they simply don’t know what that is. All you can do is stay out of their way and let the storm blow itself out.
libra,The approaching new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart means you cannot lose. Identify what it is you most want to achieve, draw up a sensible plan and focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Fame and fortune await you.
libra,Today’s new moon dares you to break out of the mental and emotional straitjacket you have made for yourself. The only reason you have not reached your goal is because, deep down, you fear you don’t have what it takes to succeed. But you do!,libra,It may seem as if all sorts of things are going wrong at the moment but it isn’t true – relatively speaking your life is a huge success. If you want to be inspired take a look at those who really do have to struggle to get things done. ,libra,The efforts you have made in recent weeks are about to pay off. All the people you helped – and there are many – will get together and do something special to thank you. The real reward, however, is knowing you have made a difference in the world.
libra,Slow down for a while and let the rest of the world catch up with you. You must not, however, let anyone persuade you to give up on a long-term aim. Whatever they may say to the contrary it is still possible, so keep striving. ,libra,If you are dissatisfied with your lot then raise your sights and start living up to your potential. The Sun in your fellow Air sign of Aquarius will do wonders for your confidence, lack of which is the only thing that has been holding you back.
libra,You will be even more forceful than usual this weekend but while you will no doubt get a great deal done you will also make a few enemies. That’s okay. Later on, when you get the chance, you can turn on the charm and win them round.
libra,You will be in one of your more assertive moods today, but don’t come on too strong or you could turn people against you. You may think you can get away with almost anything but it isn’t true. There is always someone bigger and more powerful than you.
libra,There are some days when, no matter how hard the task you have to take care of, everything comes easy to you, and this will be one of them. Ask yourself what it is you would most like to accomplish, then just go out and do it. ,libra,If you do not like the situation you find yourself in then change it. You are not now, nor have you ever been, a victim, so stop complaining that life is unfair and do something about it. Yes, there is a grand design, but you also have free will. ,libra,You need to get over the idea that you must do it all on your own, especially on the work front. No matter how ambitious you are you will reach a point soon when you can’t go further without assistance. Ask for it and you will get it. ,libra,You dislike it intensely when unexpected events disturb your methods and habits but that’s too bad because there will be severe disruptions over the next few days. Don’t get uptight about it though. In the long-term it is sure to do you good. ,libra,Don’t waste time on small talk this weekend because there are more important things you should be doing. In fact, gossip will annoy you, so avoid people who like to chatter aimlessly and spend some quality time with the most important person in your life – yourself. ,libra,You may not like asking for assistance but this is one of those occasions when you have no choice. You can be incredibly ambitious at times but ambition alone won’t be enough this week – you will need to call on other people’s experience too.
libra,The most important lessons in life don’t have to be painful but they usually are. You can sense that something needs to be changed, and if you find out what it is and do what has to be done you can bypass the pain this time. ,libra,Changes in your working routine may not be to your liking but in the long-term they will work in your favor, so don’t try to obstruct them. Progress will come whether you want it to or not, so be smart and work with the forces of change.
libra,It’s good that you have respect for people in positions of power but don’t let it blind you to the fact that they are human like everyone else. Your respect for a certain individual is based more on emotion than logic. See them for who they really are. ,libra,Mercury in Aquarius is still doing wonders for your confidence and today you will go out of your way to show the world what you can do. Don’t let anyone tell you that you are aiming too high – the fact is you can’t aim high enough. ,libra,There is virtually nothing you cannot do but that does not mean you are obliged to do everything. Identify the two or three aims that mean the most to you, then focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Success will surely follow.
libra,The best way to deal with a problem is to ignore it. The more you are the kind of Libra who likes to take charge and get things done the more you must resist the urge and go with the flow. It will all come right in the end.
libra,Employers and other authority figures will be impressed by your ability to get things done and get along with a wide range of people, even those you don’t think much of professionally. You will make difficult tasks looks easy – and yourself look good.
libra,Money worries and career issues seem to be taking up a lot of your time and emotional energy at the moment but you know from past experience that it will all come right in the end – it always does. Find reasons to smile, and make others smile too.
libra,Changes in your working routine may not be to your liking but in the long-term they will work in your favor, so don’t try to obstruct them. Progress will come whether you want it to or not, so be smart and work with the forces of change.
libra,It may annoy you that you have to follow the rules but that’s how it is. Yes, of course, you could do it better and in half the time but it’s not your call to make. Play along for now – you will get your chance to shine later.
libra,There are times when you wonder why you put up with someone’s bad behavior. So why do you? Most likely there is no reason at all, so get your act together and get them out of your life once and for all. You will feel better for it.
libra,You will need to be on your toes where anything of a financial nature is concerned. There is little doubt you will succeed but you will also attract people who think they can get rich at your expense, so take nothing and no-one for granted.
libra,The more you help friends and family this weekend the more help you will get back from the universe. If you go out of your way to do good deeds for others the cosmic powers that be will go out of their way to smile on you.
libra,You have made up your mind about your plans, so now you must get on with them. There is no point discussing the matter with family or friends because they will just try to make you change your mind. Do what feels right for you alone.
libra,There is a danger today that you will try to prove yourself by doing something that is really too much for you. Libra is a cardinal sign, which means you like to take the lead, but make sure you know where you are going before you set out.
libra,Try to steer clear of issues you do not understand. The planets warn that if you make a small change in one area it could lead to a big change in another area and it may not be the kind of change you enjoy. Leave well alone.
libra,You seem to be having second thoughts about something that previously you were keen on. But you would be wise not to make any sudden changes. Wait until Friday’s Mercury-Neptune link has passed. Only then can you trust your own mind.
libra,With the Sun moving through the wellbeing area of your chart you need to slow down a bit and focus on a narrower range of interests. If your body is giving you signals that it could do with a rest you must heed the warning. ,libra,Others may counsel caution today but if you listen to all those who have something negative to say you would never get much done. Despite their misgivings the world is not all doom and gloom, it is still wonderful and magical – and so are you.
libra,This is going to be a challenging weekend but once you get going you will do okay. If you have made a promise to a friend you must deliver – there can be no excuses. You may not feel up to it but you can’t let them down. ,libra,Be careful that in your hurry to get ahead you don’t overlook a small but important detail, one that could have a big influence on the success or failure of your ambitions. It is often the little things in life that trip us up most easily. ,libra,You will come under a considerable amount of pressure over the next few days and there may be times when you come close to lashing out at people you love. Don’t. Breath slowly and deeply and stay calm. It will all come right in the end.
libra,Try not to twist yourself in mental and emotional knots over things which you cannot control. What is fated to be will be, whether you worry about it or not, so put negative thoughts and feelings behind you once and for all. ,libra,You have a lot of things on your mind at the moment, so give yourself time to think before making your next big move. Also, take notice of what friends and family members tell you. They may have information that is relevant to your cause. ,libra,There have been some major changes in your life in recent weeks but looking further ahead you will begin to understand why they had to happen and how they will benefit you. Find reasons to smile today and tomorrow – and then have a wild weekend! ,libra,By the time the Sun enters your opposite sign of Aries on Sunday you should know for certain if a relationship is going to last or if it is best to go your separate ways. Between now and then give it every opportunity to work. ,libra,As the Sun moves into your opposite sign this weekend you can expect partnership matters of one sort or another to come to a head. But that’s good because it will force you to take those difficult decisions you have been putting off. Be decisive.
libra,Loved ones will do whatever it is you ask of them this week – within reason, of course. You like to be independent but there are occasions when even a Libra needs assistance and this is one of them. Speak up and let them know what you need. ,libra,This is potentially a great time for partnerships and affairs of the heart but it will be better still if you put your ego on hold and accept that not everyone sees things the same way as you. Live and let live and take nothing too seriously.
libra,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign makes you a lot more open to advice, and that’s good. What is not so good is that you may get the kind of advice you could do without today. Check that what you are being told is fact, not fiction. ,libra,No one will stop you from doing your own thing today but you must let others do the same. The lunar eclipse in your sign means if you try to be a control freak it is likely to backfire. Why turn those who should have been allies against you? ,libra,Focus on the good things in life and the bad things won’t make such a big impression. The way you look at the world determines to a large extent what kind of world you get to inhabit. The glass is always half full if you want it to be. ,libra,Don’t be too quick to take on new responsibilities today or over the weekend because they will distract you from more important matters. Even if you owe people favors you must not do what goes against your own long-term interests. ,libra,It may annoy you that you still have chores to complete even though it’s the weekend but they have to be done. The only way to speed things up is to knuckle down and immerse yourself in your work. Find ways to enjoy it.
libra,You may want to protect a friend from the consequences of their actions but is that such a good idea? Sometimes it is best to let people learn from their own mistakes and this may be one of those times. Nothing beats personal experience. ,libra,At some stage today you will have to speak up and let colleagues and employers know that you won’t allow them to pile still more work on your shoulders. You don’t mind doing your fair share, but you do mind being taken for granted. ,libra,Don’t be too hard on yourself if you make the kind of silly mistake that you are always telling other people to watch out for. You are only human and cannot be perfect every day of the week. Whatever happens next, make sure you have fun.
libra,Your sixth sense tells you that something is not quite right at the moment. No doubt your sixth sense is spot-on as usual but the planets suggest there is no cause for alarm. Be careful by all means but don’t be fearful for no good reason. ,libra,Let everyone know how brilliant you are. A little self-promotion is no bad thing, especially when your rivals are ramping up their efforts and looking for ways to eat into what you consider to be your own domain. All publicity is good publicity.
libra,Someone out there clearly likes you but for some reason you have been keeping them at arm’s length. Maybe you don’t trust yourself. Maybe you are afraid to open up and show your true feelings. Whatever the reason, you need to get over it! ,libra,The entry of Venus, planet of love, into the partnership area of your chart will help you reach out to those who mean something to you emotionally. Every day from now until the weekend will be good for relationships issues.
libra,When challenged, either at home or at work, you must come back with a strong response. Don’t let anyone think you are weak. You may not feel tough but you can put on an act and look tough – that should be enough.
libra,Cultivate an air of secrecy about what you are doing. It will intrigue those you live and work with and make it less likely that they will place obstacles in your path. It’s good to be open and honest but sometimes you need to keep something back. ,libra,No matter how much others try to persuade you that their way is best you must stick with what you know and trust. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign will put you under a lot of pressure but you must ignore it all. Trust yourself. ,libra,There is a danger that certain people will drag you down with their negative outlook and before you know it you will be as fearful as they are. Don’t let it happen. Others can wallow in self-pity if they want but you have so much to look forward to.
libra,There will be times over the next few days when you feel out of touch or out of favor but don’t get depressed about it. The spotlight may be on other people at the moment but that’s okay. You can’t be the star every day you know! ,libra,You will discover something interesting about a friend today, the kind of thing not even you would have guessed! It may be tempting to tell everyone about it but before you do think what the repercussions might be. Keep this secret to yourself.
libra,With your ruler Venus on excellent terms with action planet Mars you are unlikely to pass up what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Important people think highly of you and want to see you succeed, and you won’t disappoint them.
libra,Someone you usually get along with seems to be opposing you at every turn. Why is that do you suppose? Maybe it is because they are upset by your insistence that you alone know best. A less arrogant attitude might be in order Libra. ,libra,Good news to do with your work or career is likely over the next 24 hours. But you should also be thinking of ways to get away from your usual environment, at least for a while so you can recharge your batteries. Vacation time! ,libra,The Sun in your opposite sign of Aries has been good for relationships in recent weeks but come the 19th the cosmic picture will change and one-to-one issues may not be so easy to deal with. Make your peace with a loved one right now. ,libra,You may be ambitious by nature but do you have a clear idea of what it is you are hoping to accomplish? Between now and Tuesday, when the Sun changes signs, give it some thought. A sense of purpose makes all things possible. ,libra,You may not have asked for advice but if you listen to – and more importantly, act on – what partners and colleagues have to say you could make some easy money over the next few days. You’re not the only one who has lots of good ideas.
libra,If you feel compelled to go back over old ground to make sure you have not missed anything important, by all means do so. You cannot start anything new before the full moon has done it’s work this Friday anyway, so use your time wisely.
libra,Money matters will be uppermost in your mind over the next few days and that’s good because your cashflow situation is in need of a boost. A joint financial arrangement also needs looking at closely. Maybe it has become too much of a burden. ,libra,Both in your personal life and at work you need to identify your goals – then you need to stick with them until they are finished. If you abandon a task before it is completed today you are sure to regret it over the weekend.
libra,You won’t find it easy to hide your feelings today and as some of those feelings are likely to be on the aggressive side there is clearly a potential for conflict. But that’s okay. In fact it’s good. The air needs to be cleared. ,libra,You will be expected to take on several new responsibilities over the coming week and you won’t be able to wriggle your way out of it. Although on one level it might be a pain, on another it will do your reputation a power of good.
libra,The planets are urging you to show what you are capable of but you also need to be aware that not everyone wants to see you succeed. Be careful what you say today because certain people will try to twist your words and make you look bad.
libra,Your problems are nowhere near as bad as you seem to believe, so stop worrying and start enjoying life again. Certain sensitive matters will be brought into the open over the next few days but there is no need to panic – you can handle them. ,libra,Yes, you will have to take on new responsibilities before the end of the week but they won’t be as tedious as you fear. In fact, the planets indicate if you make a good job of what you are required to do you could make some serious money.
libra,You will accomplish more over the next few days if you don’t try too hard. If you were planning something spectacular it might be wise to think again, especially if there is money involved. Don’t let others take advantage of your enthusiasm.
libra,There is a luck factor working in your favor at the moment but with Mercury now moving retrograde you would be wise not to take your good fortune for granted. The old saying “easy come, easy go” just about sums it up for you today.
libra,Life is good and is sure to get even better over the weekend. If you can arrange a trip away from your usual environment you should do so, regardless of how much it might cost you financially. Think of it as an investment. ,libra,You are being far too pessimistic about the world. For every event you find yourself worrying about there are two or three others that are positive in the extreme. The only reason you don’t see them is because you don’t look for them.
libra,You appear to believe that there is a conspiracy of some kind and that you are being kept in the dark while rivals plot at your expense. It isn’t true. Even if others keep things from you it does not mean they are important.
libra,Recent events may not have been easy to deal with but you would be the first to admit they have toughened you up. You will benefit on so many levels over the next few days: mentally, emotionally, professionally – and financially too. ,libra,You need to outsmart rivals and competitors who would like nothing better than to see you fail. The best way to do that is to pretend that you don’t know what you are doing so they overestimate your inexperience and underestimate your ability. ,libra,Try not to be too reckless today, otherwise a difficult Sun-Saturn link could bring a heap of trouble down on your head. Also, don’t make a fuss if you have to pay some rather hefty bills – good times rarely come for free. ,libra,You may have been content to sit back and let things happen in recent weeks but now you must go to the other extreme and get out there in the world and stake your claim for fame and fortune. It’s what you deserve.
libra,Force yourself to be optimistic about what is going on in your world. Others can embrace doom and gloom if they want but you will go right the other way and find reasons to smile in just about everything that happens.
libra,Venus, your ruler, joins forces with Jupiter on Tuesday, bringing both your romantic feelings and your charitable instincts to the fore. You do though need to be aware that not everyone is as big-hearted as you. Don’t leave yourself open to predators.
libra,You have begun to notice that some of the things that had previously been moving ahead nicely have now started to stutter a bit. There is nothing to be alarmed about but it might be an idea to take certain things, and people, a little less for granted.
libra,Just because others try to find fault with every little thing you do does not mean you have to take any of it seriously. In fact, the more they criticize your efforts the more determined you should be to carry on as before. Don’t be intimidated. ,libra,If someone offers you what is clearly a great deal you will, of course, grab it with both hands. However, as Saturn, planet of restriction, is active today it will pay you to be cautious. The situation may not be quite as wonderful as it seems. ,libra,Don’t waste time trying to resist something that is going to happen sooner or later whether you like it or not. The most sensible thing is to adapt yourself to events as and when they occur and find ways to make changes pay for you. ,libra,You need to find a constructive way to relieve the tension that has been building up inside you. If you lose control and shout at people the results are almost certain to be negative. Find something creative, and physical, that helps you let off steam.
libra,Your generosity will win you many friends over the next 48 hours. You will give, give and give again, for no better reason than it feels so good. Make sure you keep a little back for your own needs though – or you could need some charity too! ,libra,Resist the urge to make impulse purchases during the first half of the week, because you may not be as financially well off as you would like to believe. There are a lot of new things you are planning to start, so don’t waste your resources. ,libra,You will need to be on your guard today because the planets warn that someone is looking for ways to part you from your hard-earned cash. They will only succeed if you are too trusting. A little suspicion is sometimes no bad thing.
libra,What happens today will bring a money matter to a head, and although it may not be an entirely pleasant situation at least you will know where you stand. Some serious cutbacks will have to be made but it will be worth the pain. ,libra,You may be tempted to make sweeping changes over the next few days, and that is exactly what you should do. The Sun’s imminent change of signs will give you the courage to step outside the rigid limits you have imposed on yourself.
libra,The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will coincide with a big improvement in your outlook on life. Many of the things you have been worrying about of late will fade away over the next few days- and your anxieties will fade with them.
libra,What seemed so important to you yesterday won’t seem in the least bit important today, so stop worrying and start looking at life from a more positive viewpoint. You don’t have to be one of those people who see gloom and doom everywhere. ,libra,For some time you have been reluctant to take risks because your personal or professional situation was not as strong as you would like it to be. But now the Sun is on your side again you will happily throw caution to the wind. Have fun.
libra,A sudden change of plans that is beyond your control could leave you stranded this week but don’t waste your time getting angry about it. The planets warn if you lose your cool it is you who will suffer. It’s a trivial matter really, so lighten up!,libra,If someone has not been fair with you then by all means be unfair with them in return. As a Libra you know that everything needs to be balanced, so get your own back and, if they complain, let them know they have no-one to blame but themselves.
libra,Make an effort to get to know someone new in your social circle. They have not had much to say for themselves yet, but only because they are shy. You are just the person to break the ice and help them feel like one of the gang.
libra,The planets warn if you do things too fast now you will regret it later on when you have to go back and do it all over again. There is no need to rush: you will get all the time you need to complete what really matters. ,libra,Chances are you won’t much enjoy what others spring on you today – what they think is funny will annoy you intensely – but if you are smart you will smile and pretend it’s okay. You will get a chance to get your own back next week. ,libra,No matter how many risks you have taken and got away with in recent days you must be a bit more careful today and over the weekend. Let others take the lead, and the risks, for a change, especially where money matters are concerned. ,libra,You should be looking forward to a time when you no longer have to do what other people expect of you. That time may still be a little way off but there is plenty you can do to bring it closer. Stop listening to criticism for a start. ,libra,This should be a very good day for you as both the Sun and your ruler Venus in sympathetic Gemini inspire you to do more and do better. For best results, focus your energy in one particular direction. Don’t spread yourself too thin.
libra,The planets will spring something on you today that you were not expecting. To start with you may be a bit shocked but after a while you will realize it is one of the best things that has ever happened to you. Smiles all round! ,libra,You will see something that others have missed and then find ways to turn it to your advantage. If you also use it to help people in need you will not only be better off financially but the whole world will think you are special. And you are. ,libra,You are in the middle of a hugely beneficial phase and no matter how much others say you should fear the worst you refuse to believe them, and rightly so. Some people get off on predictions of doom and gloom, but you’re not one of them.
libra,You will find it hard to resist getting annoyed with someone today. Yes, of course, they have been stupid and deserve to feel the rough edge of your tongue, but in the greater scheme of things it’s not such a big deal, so stay calm.
libra,Certain things may not have gone right for you lately but don’t think that is the end of the matter. Seen from a higher perspective even negative events have helped you, not least by making you aware of what is and is not possible.
libra,Certain things may not have gone right for you lately but don’t think that is the end of the matter. Seen from a higher perspective even negative events have helped you, not least by making you aware of what is and is not possible. ,libra,If you feel that you have been in one place too long and would do better in a different environment then by all means just get up and go. This week’s new moon will point you in the right direction. Don’t think about it, just get moving.
libra,You will need to remind yourself today that everything happens for a reason. If you forget that fact you will start feeling sorry for yourself, making it much harder to do what has to be done. Life is good and about to get even better.
libra,Try not to draw attention to something that is likely to embarrass a friend or relative. It may be funny to you but it won’t be funny to them and could even lead to a breakdown in your relationship. Just this once, let it pass.
libra,Others will go out of their way to persuade you that they know what they are talking about, but no way will you believe it. You trust your own mind and you are not afraid to turn people down, even if it means putting friendship at risk.
libra,Don’t let your good mood be spoiled by the kind of doom and gloom merchants who are always claiming the end is nigh. Sure, there are a lot of bad things going on in the world but overall it is still a marvelous place – so be happy!,libra,It always seems to be around this time of year that you start thinking of ways to escape your everyday routine. If you are planning a vacation, even if it’s for later in the year, make it one that takes you far away from your usual environment. ,libra,If a friend has nothing to hide then why are they being so mysterious? There is nothing hostile about their behaviour. They may just be embarrassed about something personal, something they don’t want you to know about. Let them have their secrets.
libra,You will want to stretch yourself more intellectually this week, especially if you have been involved in too many things of a trivial nature. Faraway places will also be much on your mind, making this the ideal time to take a vacation. ,libra,Before you say anything over the next 24 hours stop and think what the consequences might be if your words are taken the wrong way. Yes, of course, you are entitled to your opinion but that does not necessarily mean you should exercise that right.
libra,You must be totally honest with friends, family and work colleagues who come to you for advice. What you have to tell them might hurt a bit to begin with but in time they will realize it was for their own good – and will thank you for it. ,libra,Delays are to be expected today, so try to stay calm if you are on the move but find that your path is blocked in some way. Getting upset about it won’t change a thing, except perhaps to make your blood pressure higher than it should be. ,libra,The only danger now is that so many things are going well for you that you could take too much for granted. Both at home and at work keep a close eye on details, because it is the little things that are most likely to trip you up. ,libra,Before you start something new make sure it is what you genuinely want to be doing. With your ruling planet Venus moving into the career area of your chart today you must devote yourself to what you love. Money and status are of no real importance.
libra,You want to make some big changes to your lifestyle but with Saturn and Neptune on less than friendly terms it might be wise to sleep on the idea. Chances are you are not thinking straight or, worse, letting other people think for you.
libra,You have accomplished a lot in recent weeks and have every reason to feel pleased with yourself, but there is still more to do. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart tomorrow will encourage you to aim higher than ever before. ,libra,You may need to be brutal today, both with yourself and with other people. The Sun’s move into the area of your chart that governs your reputation means if things are not working out the way you had planned then you must make changes, and soon.
libra,Take life at a more civilized pace and ignore those who say you should be doing more. There comes a point where what you put in is more than what you get out, a point of diminishing returns, and you are close to that point now. ,libra,Others may complain that you are being selfish, and maybe you are, but it’s okay to look out for Number One, because no one else will. It’s a dog eat dog world out there and you have no intention of making a meal for someone. ,libra,Your schedule is going to be full and your workload heavy over the next few days, so if you were hoping to take some time off you had best put those plans on hold for a while. The efforts you make now will pay off big time later on. ,libra,It will pay you to be nice to people today, especially those you may have to call on for assistance in the not too distant future. More than anything you must show them the level of respect they deserve. They did not reach their present position by luck.
libra,There is no point denying that you have got something wrong, because it is actually no big deal. In fact if you take what you have failed at and learn from it then next time you are more likely to get it right. And there is always a next time.
libra,As from today you will have to confront feelings that you have been hiding from yourself and also from other people. The good news is that once you face up to reality those feelings will no longer hurt you the way they once did.
libra,You have energy to spare at the moment and if you are smart you will use it to do something out of the ordinary in your work or career. You have what it takes to compete at the highest level, so don’t let fear hold you back. ,libra,You may be finding it hard to focus your efforts in a single direction but that’s no bad thing. Disruptions on the work front suggest that even if you get things done now they may have to be done again later on, so why try too hard?,libra,If you allow your taste for luxuries to get the better of you today you may regret it tomorrow. On the other hand, you do need cheering up a bit and if spending money does it for you then go right ahead. Just keep it within reasonable bounds. ,libra,Your plans are likely to be a bit vague at the moment but that’s okay. In fact, as travel and social activities are subject to last minute changes it will benefit you not to make rigid plans. Stay loose and don’t take anything too seriously.
libra,You could take the easy way out and tell someone you love what they want to hear but that will only make matters worse in the long-term. If you really care for their well-being you will tell them the truth, no more and no less.
libra,You may have to change travel and social plans this weekend, in part due to other people’s carelessness, but don’t let it get to you. Adopt a serene response to every irritating thing that comes your way. That goes for irritating people too!,libra,Because the approaching new moon takes place in the career area of your chart this is the ideal time to start something new. If there is something you have been planning in secret you must now let senior colleagues and employers know about it. ,libra,You may be tempted to tear down something you created, simply because it is not up to the high standards you set for yourself, but if you do you will regret it later on. You don’t have to destroy it, you just have to improve it.
libra,Money matters and career issues seem to be taking up a lot of your time and emotional energy at the moment but you know from past experience that it will all come right in the end. Do what you have to do but don’t worry about it. ,libra,Your most important task now is to identify what it is you want out of life. Once you have done that you can go all out to get it. Others will, of course, try to distract you but you won’t let it happen. You’re on a mission.
libra,Decide what your number one priority is going to be and focus on it totally today, tomorrow and over the weekend. The choices you make now will be crucial as far as your career is concerned – so make sure they are the right choices. ,libra,The changes that are taking place, both in your own life and in the world around you, are for the best. Those who say the sky is about to fall simply do not know what they are talking about, so ignore them and keep moving forward. Embrace the future.
libra,According to the planets you have been letting things drift and need to get your life back on track. Start by asking some serious questions about your career. Never doubt you have something to offer. Never doubt you can do more and do better. ,libra,If you get the chance to travel you must take it, even if it means breaking promises to family and friends. People you meet while traveling, both in your own neighborhood and over longer distances, will bring luck, and maybe love too.
libra,No matter how dynamic a Libra you may be you will reach a point early on in the week when your energy fades and you find it hard to motivate yourself. Use your charm to get friends and family to do things for you instead.
libra,You will be more in demand socially now that Venus, your ruler, is moving in your favor again, and there is even a possibility that you will meet someone who becomes more than a friend. But don’t be too nice for your own good.
libra,You want to get things moving but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. If you are absolutely certain that what you are planning cannot fail then go ahead. But if there is even the slightest doubt in your mind you must reconsider. ,libra,At some stage today you will come into contact with someone who supports you in your quest to be different. It may sometimes have seemed as if the powers that be were against you but it isn’t true. In fact they admire you.
libra,Try something you have never done before, even if it is risky or outrageous. Others may not approve but that will make you even more determined to go through with it. You have never been the kind of person who cares what the neighbors think.
libra,It’s okay to look up to people in positions of power but don’t ever believe that they can do no wrong. Like you they are human and like you they make mistakes. Make sure your respect for them is based on reality, not wishful thinking.
libra,Something will happen over the next few days that makes you wonder if a long-term goal is really worth pursuing. No matter how disillusioned you feel you must not give up on it because others are counting on you. Your enthusiasm will return very soon.
libra,You need to be aware of your reputation and how easy it is to put it at risk. More than anything you must tell the truth, even in situations where it might be easier for everyone if you lied. Honesty is always the best policy.
libra,According to the planets you are trying so hard to please one individual that someone else is feeling neglected. If you want both relationships to survive you are going to have to be more even-handed. Isn’t that what you are supposed to be good at?,libra,Nothing is impossible for you Libra. No, really, nothing at all. Some things will be difficult, of course, but your frame of mind is such that you won’t let anything faze you. It’s not a question of if you will win but when. ,libra,The Sun is about to move into the friendship area of your chart, so get rid of that funk you have been in of late and get together with people who share your desire to enjoy life. One way or another you are sure to have fun. ,libra,In recent weeks you have looked on in amazement while people with less than half your talent have done well for themselves. Now it is your turn to shine and what happens over the coming weeks will encourage you to stand tall in the spotlight. ,libra,If you are the kind of Libra who enjoys saying and doing outrageous things you will be in your element this weekend. Just remember that when you dish it out you have to be ready to take some as well. You won’t get it all your own way.
libra,You will see with clear eyes this week what it is that life wants you to do. After that it is up to you: you can accept the challenge and fulfil your destiny, or you can reject it and always wonder what might have been. Be brave.
libra,Those who think you are the kind of person who backs down easily are wrong. You will meet fire with fire today and will soon be involved in multiple conflicts. You may not win them all but you will win the ones that matter.
libra,No matter what your differences with a certain individual may be you must make an effort to find a compromise solution. There is much you can accomplish over the next few days but you won’t get far on your own, so find ways to work together.
libra,Put petty arguments behind you and give friends and colleagues the benefit of the doubt. Some things are worth getting worked up about but what is currently troubling you is simply not worth the time, the effort or the tears, so get over it. ,libra,Certain things may now be beyond your control to influence but you should not get depressed about it. Life moves in cycles and if you are on a downward curve now you can be sure you will be on an upward curve again very soon. ,libra,Chances are you will do something today that even those who respect and admire you do not approve of. Will it worry you? Of course not. If anything you will rather enjoy being singled out for so much attention. All publicity is good publicity. ,libra,The world needs people who are not afraid to speak up. The world needs people who know that truth matters. The world needs people like you. If there is something others are afraid to draw attention to, make it your aim to let everyone know about it.
libra,The world needs people who are not afraid to speak up. The world needs people who know that truth matters. The world needs people like you. If there is something others are afraid to draw attention to, make it your aim to let everyone know about it.
libra,You will find it easy to get people to support you over the next few days. Everyone wants to do right by you. Everyone wants to be your friend. If you succeed – when you succeed – make sure your backers get a share of the spoils.
libra,There may be times today when you get a bit suspicious and wonder why everyone is being so nice to you but don’t let your doubts hold you back. The fact is everyone likes you and you deserve to be treated with love and respect.
libra,It’s not often you get on your high horse and lecture others about what they are doing wrong, but you will do so today. Your way with words means you will get your message across but try not to be too critical or you may make enemies.
libra,You are having second thoughts about something that only a short time ago you believed in. Listen to what your inner voice tells you and don’t be afraid to go against public opinion – on this occasion you are right and everyone else is wrong. ,libra,You seem to believe that you are the victim of a conspiracy but more likely you are letting your imagination run riot and allowing negative ideas to creep into your mind. Enemies are for other people. You are universally loved and admired.
libra,Everything will fall into place over the next 48 hours. Having stumbled around in the dark for so long you will suddenly see the light at the end of the tunnel and all things will be clear to you. Next time, don’t wilfully blind yourself to reality.
libra,If you make promises to those you love today you may have to break them tomorrow. Better then that you make no promises at all. They already know you will always do your best for them. They don’t need promises, they just need you.
libra,What occurs over the next two or three days will make you wonder if you have been a bit too hasty about a career-related matter. Maybe your friends are right, maybe you need to take another look at the facts. Maybe you got it wrong this time.
libra,If you discover that a friend has been telling tales about you then by all means cut them out of your life. But make sure you know the facts of the situation before taking such a radical course of action. Have they really been that disloyal?,libra,Although what you are expected to do today may not be to your liking once you get to work on it you may be surprised to discover that you quite enjoy the challenge. With the right mental attitude even chores can be fun.
libra,If someone tries to abuse their authority today you must not let them get away with it. Even if you prefer to keep your head down and not rock the boat what happens next will enrage you so much you will find it impossible to stay silent.
libra,On no account must you accept less than you are worth today, whatever kind of work you do. If you allow your value to be undermined it will take a great deal of time and effort to raise it up again. Good service does not come cheap. ,libra,Go where you want to go, do want you want to do and don’t waste even a second of your precious time worrying about how much it might cost or who might not approve. Fifty years from now who is going to know or care? Be bold Libra!,libra,Creatively you are on a high at the moment but there is a danger that the approaching full moon will tempt you to go too far. Don’t start anything you may not be able to finish and don’t make promises you may not be able to keep. ,libra,You are in such a determined mood. Nothing can daunt you and nothing can deflect you from the path you have chosen to take. Too often in the past you have failed to follow through to the end, but this time it’s different.
libra,You will do something today that turns heads and gets tongues wagging, much to your amusement. But don’t go too far and get your laughs at other people’s expense or you could create enemies out of people who should have been friends.
libra,The more the doubters tell you something cannot be done the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Just make sure you know what you are doing and don’t be provoked into taking action that could easily end in tears. ,libra,Certain people just rub you up the wrong way and with a full moon to contend with today you would be wise to stay out of their way. Do not, repeat not, argue with them about what is right and what is wrong. It will end in tears.
libra,No matter what partners and loved ones may have said or done to annoy you in recent weeks you must put it behind you now and focus on the simple, everyday things that you will always have in common. Don’t let differences drive you apart.
libra,Put principle before profit this weekend and don’t worry if you end up out of pocket – you will more than make up for it later on. You can see clearer and further than most other people now, so trust what your inner voice tells you.
libra,You have so many great ideas but not much of an idea what you can do with them all. Don’t worry. The next few weeks are more about thinking and planning than actually doing. You will know when the time is right to act.
libra,You may be more suspicious than usual over the next few days but that’s okay as it will keep you on your toes. Just don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the world is out to get you – that’s not healthy suspicion, that’s paranoia.
libra,There are times when even a Libra needs be alone with their thoughts and this is one of them. Find a way to switch off from the noise and confusion of the outside world and give yourself some much-needed mental and emotional breathing space.
libra,The spotlight is very much on you now and you must not try to avoid it. Even if you are the kind of Libra who prefers to keep a low profile you will find you actually enjoy being the center of attention, at least for a while.
libra,You may not be the sort to make a big deal of your emotions but before the day if through you must declare your love for someone who means the world to you. And remember: once is never enough. Tell them again tomorrow and the day after that. ,libra,If you put your mind to it over the next 24 hours you will come up with an ingenious solution to a difficult problem. Remember, just become something was a mystery yesterday does not mean it needs to remain a mystery today and tomorrow.
libra,Make sure you are aware how much you are worth. That applies not only in a financial sense but in a wider sense too, because if you sell yourself short now you will regret it later when you realize how much you could have asked for.
libra,You may be tempted to give up on something that is not working but if you do you will regret it later on. Put it on the back burner for a few weeks, or even a few months, and come back to it when your enthusiasm returns.
libra,It’s not what you know but who you know that matters and what happens over the next 24 hours will hammer that point home dramatically. Important people are watching you closely and if they like what they see will reward you handsomely.
libra,As Libra, your ruler, moves into your sign today it won’t be long before you realize that so many of the things you got uptight about in recent weeks were simply not worth the effort. Life is, and always will be, beautiful.
libra,No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been you should be feeling confident that the worst is over. What happens over the next 48 hours will confirm that you have toughened up – and now you are about to go up in the world!,libra,As from today you will understand what has been going on and why it was necessary to keep you away from the truth. You may or may not be delighted by what you are told but you will certainly be happy to be back in the loop.
libra,Something you thought you had dealt with weeks, months, maybe even years ago will return to vex you over the next 48 hours. This time you can and you must get past it for keeps. You cannot afford to let it bother you again.
libra,You may not enjoy what others expect you to do this week but you must do it anyway because the last thing you need now is to upset people in positions of power. Show willing, unless what you are asked to do is totally outrageous. ,libra,The planets indicate there is someone who is dear to you who feels left out of things and your first aim this week must be to reassure them that they are still in your thoughts and still have a part in your plans. You need each other.
libra,You may be outgoing and fun-loving by nature but you treasure your own company too, so if you don’t feel like being sociable today it’s not a problem. Tell others you are saving yourself for a really big party that’s coming up this weekend. ,libra,If others react with shock at what you do today they have only themselves to blame. You have been warning them for weeks if not months that things could not continue as they are and now the time has come to make major changes. ,libra,Libra may be a cardinal sign but just lately you have felt anything but dynamic. That has a lot to do with the Sun in the most sensitive area of your chart but with Jupiter moving into your own sign tomorrow your self-belief will soon be soaring. ,libra,Jupiter’s move into your sign today marks the start of a lengthy period in which you will feel as if the world is yours to command. Yes, of course, that is an exaggeration but generally speaking what you wish for you are likely to get. ,libra,There is a real possibility that you will take the kind of risks you usually go out of your way to avoid – and the results are unlikely to be to your liking. It’s okay to play safe Libra, it’s what smart people do all the time.
libra,At some stage over the coming week you will have no choice but to get tough with someone who is making your life difficult for no good reason. Hopefully they will get the message and mend their ways. If not, make it painful for them.
libra,By all means have high expectations but keep your feet on the ground too, especially later in the week when an eclipse in the health area of your chart could make you a bit reckless. Look ahead and imagine what the worst case scenario might be.
libra,Some of your friends have been telling you that someone you hang out with is no good for you but you have refused to take what they say seriously. What happens today will force you to reconsider. Could be your friends were right after all.
libra,You will be required to get your head around some rather deep thoughts today. A lot is going on in the outside world at the moment but there is also a lot taking place in your inner world, and you cannot afford to ignore it. ,libra,Whatever happens over the next 24 hours you must not allow yourself to overreact. Something out of the ordinary is likely to occur but there is nothing to fear so long as you stay calm and refuse to get caught up in the general hysteria.
libra,Your workload is likely to be heavy this weekend, even though the effects of the lunar eclipse are beginning to fade. There are plenty of people who will gladly help you out if you ask them to. Don’t let your pride get in the way.
libra,A solution to your cashflow problems will become apparent soon but be warned: it may require a considerable sacrifice on your part. Once you have adjusted your finances you will feel a huge sense of relief. Next time, don’t spend so much!,libra,Don’t give up on something just because you are finding it a struggle. A day or two from now it will come easy to you, so stick with it. If you throw in the towel now you will regret it later when you realize how close you were to success.
libra,The more excited you are about something today the more you are advised to keep it under wraps, because once certain people realize what it is you desire they will be able to use it as a weapon against you, most likely by denying you. ,libra,The Sun joins Jupiter, planet of luck, in your sign today, making this the ideal time to put a name to your dreams. Give it some thought today, tomorrow and over the weekend and come the start of next week you will be on the path to success. ,libra,If you want someone to do something for you over the next 24 hours you will have to make it worth their while. That may or may not mean an exchange of cash but it certainly means you must demonstrate how highly you value your friendship. ,libra,There will be times this weekend when things get so busy that you start wishing life was a bit more relaxed again. You won’t really mean it though. Just a few days ago you were complaining that things were too quiet. Get used to the new pace. ,libra,Much as you might like to help a friend in their hour of need there are good reasons why you should hold back for a bit. Chances are you will make matters worse if you get involved in their dilemma. Let them sort it out for themselves.
libra,Partnership situations will go well for you over the next 24 hours but affairs of the heart will go better than ever. Don’t be shy about expressing your feelings because others are sure to respond in a positive manner. You can’t help being irresistible!,libra,You will have to deal with a relationship problem today and it may not be as easy as you would like. You may be willing to let bygones be bygones but it seems not everyone feels the same way as you. Keep working at it though.
libra,This may be a tense time for you but if you keep telling yourself there is nothing to worry about and if you focus on pleasant and happy things then pleasant and happy things are more likely to occur. It’s called positive thinking, and it works!,libra,Money matters are under favorable stars at the moment. Not only will you deal with financial issues with confidence but you will quite enjoy sorting out other people’s problems for them. They will sing your praises and feel indebted to you.
libra,There is an energy and urgency about you now that makes all things possible and with a new moon in your sign over the weekend you really should be aiming higher than ever before. Just make sure your mind stays in control of your emotions.
libra,A new moon in your sign endows you with a huge amount of confidence and you will be motivated to take action of one sort or another. Follow your instincts and, if you want to satisfy your material desires, do so without feeling guilty about it.
libra,All things are possible, at least for you. Not only is the Sun moving through your sign but Saturn, planet of rewards, is on your side too, so push your doubts aside and start acting as if you cannot lose, because the fact is you can’t!,libra,You can, if you wish, force others to go along with your plans today but is that really such a good idea? The planets warn that if you are too pushy now you could regret it later in the month when you need other people’s assistance. ,libra,People want to know what you believe in and you must tell them. You may not enjoy drawing attention to yourself but the planets won’t let you get away with hiding in the shadows. You have a great deal to offer, so get involved.
libra,There may be times today when it feels as if the world is ganging up on you but it’s not even remotely true. No one is out to get you and no one is keeping things from you. It’s your imagination playing tricks on you again.
libra,You will be dominant and decisive today but that does not give you the right to force others to do what they don’t want to do. Just because you have the power does not mean you have to use it. Build relationships, don’t destroy them.
libra,This could be an emotional day for you – you will get angry one minute and break down in tears the next. Difficulties with loved ones and authority figures will come to the fore but it is how you choose to react to them that matters. ,libra,What occurs this weekend will take you by surprise but you should have seen it coming. The fact is you ignored the warning signals in the hope that the issue might just go away. It didn’t and it won’t, so deal with it now.
libra,Even if you are the sort of Libra who likes to stick with tried and tested ways you must be more adventurous in the near future. That applies as much to your love life as it does to your work. A new romance could be just what you need. ,libra,You are at a crossroads as far as a creative project is concerned. Do you carry on with it, even though it has become a struggle, or do you give up and focus your energy on something else? That’s a lot of time and effort you would have wasted!,libra,Today’s Mercury-Jupiter link in your sign endows you with so much confidence and optimism and energy. The only danger is you might get carried away and go to extremes. Remember, causes always have consequences, even when times are good. ,libra,If someone gives you a hard time today you must not hesitate to give them a hard time back – it’s the only language they understand. No one has the right to force you to support what you do not believe in. Stand up for yourself. ,libra,Someone will use their position to get you to do things you would not choose to do if you were in control. But you’re not and you really have no alternative but to go along with their plans. Do it with a smile – it won’t be so bad. ,libra,This is and will continue to be an enjoyable time for you and there is no reason why it should end anytime soon. However, later in the month you will have to be a bit more careful with money, so don’t spend it all in one go. ,libra,Your way is best, of course, and if others would only follow your example everything would work out for the best. But how likely is that? Stop trying to persuade those who don’t want to be persuaded – use your time and energy in more constructive ways.
libra,You must not let others dictate to you in any way, shape or form. Once they get the impression that you can be ordered about they will make your life a misery. Make sure they know that you are the boss, of your own life anyway. ,libra,The harder you work the less you seem to get done at the moment, which is hugely frustrating. Chances are the planets are holding you back because you have overlooked a small but important detail. Find out what it is and deal with it.
libra,Jealousy will rear its ugly head today and if you are not careful you could have a severe falling out with someone. It won’t be the end of the world, of course, by why let it happen in the first place? Whatever the issue, it’s not worth the hassle.
libra,When the Sun moves into your sign at the weekend your confidence will soar and it won’t be long before you are trying new and exciting things. But don’t get carried away. The more you think now the more success you will have later on.
libra,Refuse to give in to negative emotions. The moment you start seeing yourself as a victim is the moment when you invite other people to treat you as one. You and you alone control your fate, so stand tall and get things done.
libra,In recent weeks all eyes have been on you and there were times when it got a bit too much. Now you can step out of the spotlight and focus on those private things you feel you have been neglecting. Start thinking about ways to make money too.
libra,There is no point worrying about a money matter because it is out of your hands. All you can do is wait and see what happens and react appropriately when the time comes. Nothing bad will happen. You may even profit from sudden changes.
libra,If your financial resources are a bit depleted you can quite easily think up new ways to make some extra cash. But don’t do anything too reckless or you could end up even more worse off than you are now. Use some common sense.
libra,The most important thing today is that you stay focused on your number one priority. Friends will inevitably try to distract you but no matter how many interesting things may be going on around you they can and they must be ignored.
libra,Venus, your ruling planet, is working in your favor now and there will be applause and rewards wherever you go. You know what you want, you know how to get it and you know that nothing and no one can stand in your way. ,libra,If you are reluctant to put yourself forward and take the initiative you may find you get overlooked for a job or position that would have been perfect for you. Break out of your shell today and make sure you get noticed. ,libra,If you are under pressure then take a break. It’s not important what others might think about it, the only thing that matters is that you don’t work too hard and risk doing yourself physical or emotional harm. Even Libras need some down time occasionally. ,libra,Don’t be too eager to agree with what other people say this weekend. Your interpretation of what is going on may be outrageous in some people’s eyes but the planets say you are closer to the truth than either they or you realize.
libra,Not only do you need to make more of your talents but you need to make sure you get paid for them as well. You may be easygoing by nature Libra but that does not mean you should accept less than you are worth, not now, not ever.
libra,Arguments of one kind or another are to be expected today. You are so full of self-belief at the moment that others want to prove you wrong. They can only succeed if you fail to back up your opinions with relevant facts.
libra,You have rediscovered your zest for life and are frantically trying to make up for lost opportunities by having as good a time as is humanly possible. Not everyone can change as easily as you though, so don’t force others to follow your lead.
libra,There are so many good things going on in your life at the moment that it would be easy to forget about your long-term ambitions – and that could be costly. By all means enjoy yourself but take care of business too. Money never sleeps.
libra,Don’t try to beat your rivals into submission today, no matter how much you think they deserve it. Look instead for compromise solutions that everyone can feel happy with. They are available if you make an effort to look for them. ,libra,This may be a frustrating time for you but it won’t last forever so don’t despair. A few days from now Mars will move into the most dynamic area of your chart and you will be on the front foot again. Between now and then try to relax. ,libra,You will find what you have been searching for this weekend but you still won’t be satisfied. Could it be you are beginning to realize that the answers you seek are not to be found “out there” but “in here”? Listen to the still, small voice inside.
libra,You will start to feel more confident and dynamic over the next few days. You know what you want and you know where to get it and from Wednesday onwards you will go all out to make it your own. Only a fool would stand against you.
libra,You need to come down to earth a bit and deal with matters of a practical nature. Most of all you need to be sensible with money, especially if you are the kind of Libra for whom “easy come, easy go” seems to make perfect sense.
libra,If you are of the opinion that the good things in life are somehow going to fall in your lap then, inevitably, you will be disappointed. If there is something you desire you personally must make an effort to go out and get it.
libra,Energy planet Mars moves into the most creative area of your chart today, making it easy to push ahead again with projects that have been at a standstill for a while. Decide what it is that YOU want to accomplish, then just get on with it. ,libra,With Mars giving a huge boost to your confidence you won’t hesitate to try something you have wanted to do for such a long time. Others may be shocked by your behavior but you really won’t care – in fact it will give you a thrill.
libra,The only thing you need to remember today is that a job worth doing is a job worth getting paid for. Others will undoubtedly try to cheat you out of what you deserve but they can only succeed if you let them get away with it. ,libra,If you had words with a friend or family member recently now is the time to make amends. Admit that you were in the wrong, even if it was as much their fault as it was your own. Do whatever it takes to get back on good terms.
libra,Before you open your mouth to speak this week make sure your brain is fully engaged. You may not mean to be deliberately offensive but the approaching full moon will encourage you to go too far and say things you may later regret. ,libra,The planets warn you could be too confident for your own good today. If you take too much for granted you may be disappointed when your efforts bring less than you expected. Confidence is a fragile thing, so don’t do anything that might crush it.
libra,Unexpected developments both at home and at work will force you to react quickly today. Whatever the facts of a given situation, if your intuition tells you a different story it is your intuition you must follow. Never, ever second guess your inner voice.
libra,Both at home and at work events will start moving in your favor again very soon, so keep your chin up and refuse to be gloomy. Good news on the work or money front will lift your spirits today – and there is even better news to come. ,libra,You must stay sharp when dealing with financial matters. If you let things drift or let other people call the shots you could find yourself out of pocket by the end of the week. The Sun in Scorpio demands that you take money matters seriously.
libra,There are things going on behind the scenes that are being kept from you and, of course, you are none too happy about it. Don’t worry, you will find out what’s going on over the weekend – and you may wish you were back in the dark again.
libra,You feel in such good form physically at the moment that you feel as if you could take on the world and win. Maybe you could but nothing quite so drastic is called for. Use your energy to help other people – and maybe indulge yourself a little.
libra,You will find yourself in conflict with someone whose opinions are the opposite of your own and the fact is there can be no real winner. You will not change their viewpoint and they will not change yours, so keep your distance and hope for the best.
libra,Keep your options open and don’t let anyone pressure you into making any hasty decisions. The way ahead will become clear over the next few days and you will know without a shadow of a doubt what needs to be done to be a success.
libra,You will do as you please today and anyone who does not like it can go jump. You will demand and get respect but be careful when dealing with people whose power exceeds your own. Don’t make enemies for no good reason.
libra,Jupiter in your sign gives your confidence a boost and you must not waste it. Do something that gets you noticed, something that gets other people talking. Give your ego permission to put on a show – and yes it’s okay if it’s outrageous! ,libra,The pace of life will speed up a lot over the next few days and come the weekend there will be such a frenzy of activity that you find it hard to keep up. Social activities will bring a great deal of joy but don’t burn yourself out.
libra,Anything is possible if you want it enough. Jupiter in your birth sign urges you not to worry about whether or not you are doing the right thing, because the right thing is nothing more than what matters to you. It’s your needs that count. ,libra,Say what is on your mind over the next 48 hours, even if it offends people you want to stay on good terms with. The closer you get to the new moon in Sagittarius early next week the easier it will be to put your point of view across. ,libra,Communication is the key to success and the more you talk things through with partners and colleagues the more you will understand that your interests and their interests are one and the same, or at least close enough to make co-operation viable.
libra,No matter how many misunderstandings there have been of late the approaching new moon will make communication so much easier. Be honest with others and they will be honest with you. If you open up emotionally the results are sure to delight you.
libra,Don’t let other people impose restrictions on you, and certainly don’t impose them on yourself. Go where you want to go and do what you want to do. Socially and romantically you will get more out of the day if you do what comes naturally. ,libra,You like to be different and you like to flout rules but the planets warn if you do that today you could find yourself in a lot of trouble. Be wary of anyone who encourages you to take risks – it may be they want to see you fail. ,libra,Keep your thoughts to yourself as much as you can today. If knowledge is power then it stands to reason that if you give too much away it is your power that is in danger of declining. Take the Fifth Amendment – you don’t HAVE to talk after all. ,libra,Do you feel lucky? You should, because Jupiter in your sign, allied to energy planet Mars, means if you act quickly and decisively you cannot help but achieve something amazing. If you know what you want there is every chance you will get it. ,libra,You will have no trouble convincing those around you that your way is best this weekend – and for once you may even be right! Your natural charm and your way with words will help you twist everyone round your delicate Libra little finger. ,libra,You have been working so hard of late that you may have neglected the fun things, and that is something you need to put right. Venus, your ruler, moves into the most dynamic area of your chart in midweek, so get ready to party. ,libra,You are in one of those moods when you just cannot be bothered to make much of an effort. In which case you will have no right to complain if what happens is not to your liking. Come on Libra you can do better than this. Get motivated.
libra,You can, if you wish, pretend that you cannot see what is going on in front of you but if you do your conscience will nag at you until you do something about it. You know what you must do when an injustice takes place – so do it!,libra,Anyone who stands in your way today is unlikely to be standing for long. A Mars-Uranus link makes you extremely assertive, even aggressive, but try to realise that not all of life’s problems can be solved through the application of brute strength.
libra,There is nothing you cannot do while Jupiter, planet of good fortune, remains in your sign. The omens are remarkably positive now, so decide what it is you need to possess, then go out and get it. Yes, it really is as simple as that.
libra,This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you as the Sun links with Jupiter, planet of good fortune, in your sign. Make the most of the good things coming your way – you know from experience they can depart again just as quickly.
libra,If you are on the move over the next 48 hours you should plan the route you intend to take with care. You should also give yourself plenty of extra time to reach your destination because delays and hold-ups are more likely than not.
libra,Don’t give away any clues about what you are planning. This week’s cosmic influences could loosen your tongue and lead you to reveal something that your rivals will seize on. Remember, knowledge is power, so keep what you know to yourself.
libra,You won’t care in the slightest what others think of your behavior today – in fact you will make it a point of principle to shock them. Life is too short to waste time wondering if friends and colleagues approve of your actions. Just do it.
scorpio,The upcoming new moon in the money area of your chart will bring out your extravagant side (yes, you do have one) and if you are not careful your taste for the high life could leave you broke. Make sure others pay their share.
scorpio,You may have to hurt someone’s feelings today by saying something you know they don’t want to hear but if you don’t they will keep making the same mistake over and over again. As a friend, you have a duty to speak up.
scorpio,The more you are told you can’t have something the more you will make a point of getting it – which could be fun but could also lead to situations that do you no favors. Don’t let your desires get out of hand and become obsessions.
scorpio,You may have deep personal feelings about a certain situation but you must not let emotions get in the way of what needs to be done. Yes, of course, love makes the world go around but it needs a large dash of common sense too.
scorpio,You will, as usual, get your way today and you will, as usual, win whatever battle of words and wits you are involved in. Bear this thought in mind though: just because you win does not mean you are right. Which is more important? ,scorpio,Everything is going according to plan and even though you may not get all the things you desire today you will certainly get all the things you need. The cosmos, as always, is looking over and looking after you, so why worry?,scorpio,Lack of confidence is rarely your problem but this could be one of those days when you are reluctant to take a risk or get involved in issues that could be divisive. Maybe that’s good. Maybe you should be acting less and thinking more.
scorpio,Fate may at times seem to be having fun at your expense but that is just the way it looks in the short-term. Try not to think of what happens in terms of days and weeks but in months and years. Your future looks exceedingly bright. ,scorpio,No matter how honest you think someone may be you would be wise not to let them make decisions for you today, especially if those decisions involve your hard-earned cash. If there are any risks to be taken you must take them yourself.
scorpio,Seize the initiative. Start something new. Yes, of course, you have failed to follow through so many times in the past but this time can and will be different. What happened to all those big ideas you had? They’re still there for you to use.
scorpio,You may not be able to rely on certain people as much as you have done in recent weeks but the truth is you no longer need them. There is a major luck factor working in your life at the moment. Take full advantage of it.
scorpio,When you get annoyed you tend to go to extremes and some unfortunate person is going to be in your bad books today. Yes, maybe you will be too hard on them, but it will be a long time before they dare to upset you again.
scorpio,You could be a bit too secretive for your own good today. According to the planets you will do better, both financially and emotionally, if you open up and let friends and family members know how you feel and what it is you need.
scorpio,You seem to be going through one of those phases when you turn your attention in on yourself. There’s nothing wrong with that but don’t forget you have duties in the wider world too. Too much inner analysis could be costly (and boring).
scorpio,Try not to rely so much on your hunches over the next seven days. Yes, of course, your inner voice can usually be trusted but it would still be wise to check facts and figures for yourself before laying your money on the table.
scorpio,You will be rather outspoken today, which is not that unusual, but make sure your criticisms are justified or you could make enemies of people who should be your friends. If you damage someone’s reputation they’ll want to damage you.
scorpio,Someone will give you a hard time today and as you are not the sort to back down it could lead to a bad situation. However, if you find yourself battling someone in a position of power don’t take it too far. You’ll lose in the long-term.
scorpio,You won’t get things all your own way today, especially on the home front where partners and loved ones are anything but reasonable. The good news is this is only a passing phase, so let it pass and don’t be tempted to blow your top.
scorpio,Slow things right down and take stock of how far you have come, because only then will you be in a position to decide how far you still have to go. Despite what some might say you’ve done well and deserve a pat on the back. ,scorpio,Be careful what you say because you could easily go over the top and let slip something that causes trouble. It might also cost you financially if others get the impression that you can’t hold your tongue in sensitive situations.
scorpio,You are dwelling too much on the past when you should be thinking ahead. The good news is your attitude will take a turn for the better today. The even better news is the attitude of others towards you will be positive in every way.
scorpio,You won’t worry much about money over the next few days, mainly because there are so many things going on in your life that you don’t have time to stop and count your cash. Good. The less you think about it the happier you will be.
scorpio,There is a danger that you could let your emotions get the better of you, just when you need to think with your head rather than feel with your heart. Personal factors must be kept out of things today. It’s all about common sense.
scorpio,You will get the chance to move up in the world in some way over the next few days and even though your mind may be on other things you must grab the opportunity. Don’t worry about taking on more responsibility – you’ll handle it.
scorpio,You may find it hard to express yourself in the way you want to today but it’s no big deal. Those who know you well also know how you feel about them, so there’s no need to worry. Besides, actions always speak louder than words.
scorpio,Something important is about to happen in your life and chances are it is something you will enjoy very much. Most likely it will have something to do with your social life, so don’t sit at home brooding – get out into the world.
scorpio,Some people can be amazingly stupid but you won’t make them any smarter by making a big deal out of their mistakes. They are who they are and that isn’t going to change, so as far as possible just keep out of their way.
scorpio,In the greater scheme of things there is no such thing as luck: ultimately we all get what we deserve. Bear that thought in mind if someone tells you that your good fortune has not been earned. On the contrary, no one deserves it more.
scorpio,Do what comes naturally and don’t worry in the slightest what other people might think about it. The more open you are about your needs and desires and the more confident you look, speak and act the more respect you will get from the world.
scorpio,You may experience a loss of confidence today but there is nothing to fear or get worked up about. On the contrary, with so many positive influences working for you now even your “down” times will look “up” to most other people.
scorpio,A little cooperation will go a long way over the next 24 hours, so be ready to put your differences with certain people behind you and look for ways you can work together for your mutual benefit. You don’t have to be at odds all the time. ,scorpio,This should be a thoroughly enjoyable day and even if you have serious things to do you will still have a great deal of fun. Someone you meet while socializing or traveling will become more than just a friend, and that’s a nice thought.
scorpio,There is no point feeling sorry for yourself, not even if your number one plan seems to have hit a brick wall. If fate in its wisdom wants you to stop for a while or maybe even try a different course just take it in your stride.
scorpio,News you have been waiting for will arrive today and put an end to a worrying phase. Whether the news is “good” or “bad” is unimportant — what matters is that at last you know where you stand. Now you can start moving forward again.
scorpio,Try not to let others know what you are thinking today, because most likely you are not thinking straight and what you say will cause misunderstandings. Keep your lips sealed. For a secretive Scorpio that should not be too difficult.
scorpio,You still seem to be brooding on things that are over and done with. You may have good reason to feel hard done by but you cannot go back and change the past – you can only go forward and make sure the future is different.
scorpio,The choices you make over the next few days will have a major impact on the direction your life takes over the next few months, so make them wisely. You don’t have to be cautious but you do have to be aware of all the options.
scorpio,Stop worrying that you are not doing enough or that your rivals are winning. The planets indicate that success will be yours once you learn to relax and not take life so seriously. Strangely, that’s when the serious rewards start to arrive. ,scorpio,It seems you have made an error of judgment and all you can do is say sorry. If you sound sincere about it others will forgive you and you can move on together. If, however, your apology is grudging bad feelings are likely to linger.
scorpio,Let others know what you are willing to put up with and what will happen if they push their luck too far. There is a time to be tactful but this isn’t one of them – be bold and, if you think it is necessary, be a touch brutal too.
scorpio,Interesting information will come your way over the next 24 hours, the kind of information that makes it easier for you to get your way. Once others realize you are ahead of the game they are much more likely to do as you say.
scorpio,A minor difference of opinion could get out of hand and lead to a major upheaval today. Yes, of course, others can be both unreasonable and touchy at times, but you don’t have to fan the flames. It does not have to be a war of words.
scorpio,Make sure the figures you are responsible for add up, because if there are any discrepancies your rivals will point the finger and suggest it’s all your fault. Take extra care financially – make sure every last cent is accounted for.
scorpio,You seem to be more open towards strangers than usual and that’s good because someone you meet over the next few days could become not just a friend but also a business partner. You can have fun and make money together too.
scorpio,You will push yourself hard over the next few days, of that there is little doubt, but will you push yourself in the right direction? That remains to be seen. Just make sure you don’t push past someone in a position of power – they won’t like it.
scorpio,The tensions in one particular area of your life have almost reached breaking point but that need not be as bad as it sounds. In fact it could even be good if it clears away all those resentments you’ve been saving up these past few months.
scorpio,Don’t get upset if others don’t seem interested in what you have to tell them. It’s unlikely you will get much sense out of them over the next 24 hours. If you want intelligent conversation, you may have to talk to yourself.
scorpio,Try not to make decisions for friends and loved ones because no matter how well intentioned you may be they are sure to resent it. Let them learn from their own mistakes and be there to help them up off the floor if they need it.
scorpio,Family matters of one sort or another seem to be taking up an increasingly large part of your time and energy. That is only to be expected but it does not mean you have to let other people’s needs eclipse your own. You have desires too.
scorpio,The problems that confront you now are problems you have faced many times before, so you should know how to deal with them. But if you are still not sure what your next move should be don’t be afraid to ask a friend for advice.
scorpio,Try to be more sensitive when dealing with emotional issues that involve other people. The thing to remember is that not everyone is as robust as you – in fact some people are quite fragile. So, if they burst into tears, you’re doing it wrong!,scorpio,The decisions you make over the next few days will have a lasting impact on your domestic situation, so make sure you know all the facts and make sure you are not being misled by those who have an axe to grind or an agenda to fulfill.
scorpio,You may be reserved by nature but every now and again you go right the other way and say things that shock those around you – and this is one of those days. Put simply, you’ve had enough of complaints and criticisms. It’s time to hit back.
scorpio,Rarely have you had so many obligations. Rarely have your duties been so arduous. That’s the bad news. The good news is there are people in your life who will happily lend a hand – all you have to do is ask. Or is that too much for your ego?,scorpio,There is a reason for everything that happens in life – ultimately there is no such thing as luck. Keep that thought in mind today and it will help you keep your feet on the ground regardless of whether events are classed as “good” or “bad”.
scorpio,It will pay you to adopt a low profile this weekend, not least because a certain individual is looking for an excuse to pick holes in what you say and do. Don’t make it easy for them: do one of your famous disappearing acts.
scorpio,Some kind of feud or falling-out is getting you down but the good news is that if you make the first move and let others know that you want to be friends again they will jump at the chance to make a new start. Go for it.
scorpio,Don’t do something just because it is forbidden today – it may be fun breaking the rules but it could also be costly. Risks are allowed, of course, but they must be of the calculated variety. Anything else is asking for trouble.
scorpio,Anything of a creative nature will go well, but it will go even better if you make an effort to involve loved ones in what you are doing. Sometimes you get so intensely involved in your work that others feel left out. Let them help you.
scorpio,If your daily routine is making too many demands on you, then maybe it’s time you did something about it. However, because the changes you make this week are likely to become permanent changes, make sure you really want them.
scorpio,No matter how badly someone may have let you down you must forgive them. There is no point holding a grudge, not when there are so many wonderful things going on in the world. If you’re not smiling then you’re doing it wrong.
scorpio,Have fun. Enjoy yourself. Hang out with your friends. This isn’t a day to think about work or money or any of the many other things you have been worrying about. You deserve a break so reward yourself. Others will be happy for you too.
scorpio,Your money worries should begin to ease this weekend but you must not lose sight of the fact that the underlying cause of your financial anxiety remains. In the long-term you must either cut back on your spending or earn a lot more.
scorpio,Take care that in your hurry to impress important people you don’t overestimate your abilities and take on too much. You may not like to say “no” to those whose support you are trying to secure but they won’t be impressed if you fail to deliver.
scorpio,You need to ask the right questions today and to ask the right questions you need to see your life for what it is, not what you wish it might be. Your main task for the next 24 hours, and after, is to be completely honest with yourself.
scorpio,If you can imagine it, you can do it — yes, it really is as simple as that. You know what it is you desire and you know what needs to be done to get it, so stop playing around and get serious about your ambitions. Time is running out. ,scorpio,You may have to be abrupt, even rude, with certain people today, simply because they are too slow and too stupid to work things out for themselves. Don’t bruise egos for the fun of it but make sure what needs to get done gets done, and quickly.
scorpio,If you must get involved in a dispute between friends make sure you are scrupulously even-handed. If you give the impression that you favor one side more than the other you will make things worse than if you had left well alone.
scorpio,There is a real chance that one or more of your dreams is about to come true, so keep telling yourself that all things are possible and keep believing that success is just around the next corner. Today’s dream is tomorrow’s reality.
scorpio,Don’t worry too much if you feel a bit gloomy today because you will brighten up considerably later in the week. If you don’t feel like working or socializing then don’t force yourself. Sit quietly, think deeply and meditate on the meaning of life.
scorpio,Not everyone is as dynamic as you, and you would be wise to bear that thought in mind today, especially when dealing with people who seem indecisive. You may think they are dragging their feet on purpose but it’s just the way they are. ,scorpio,All things are possible for those born under the sign of the Scorpion but that does not mean success will happen as if by magic – you still need to be clear about what it is you want and committed to getting it. Reaffirm your desires today.
scorpio,There is still time, just, to make your feelings known but if you leave it too late in the day the opportunity will slip past and it won’t come again for quite a while. Don’t worry that you might be rejected. Others think highly of you.
scorpio,It seems you are having second thoughts about a career move. You want to move up in the world, of course, but is this the route you should be taking? Think about it but don’t make any decisions yet. Everything will be clearer next week.
scorpio,People expect you to be cautious, so why not surprise them this weekend and do something out of the ordinary? It may be a long time before you feel this open and outgoing again, so make the most of it and make sure you get noticed.
scorpio,The good times may have been avoiding you of late but in a matter of days, maybe hours, your luck will improve a hundredfold. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow marks the start of the most dynamic and creative time of the year.
scorpio,The Sun spends the next few weeks transiting the most dynamic and creative area of your chart, so set your sights high and don’t think for a moment that you can’t reach the top. A positive attitude will yield positive results in all your affairs.
scorpio,Avoid quick fixes and dubious schemes today because, inevitably, they will cost you money. Anyone who approaches you with any of those once-in-a-lifetime, just-can’t-lose proposals must be shown the door. Make sure you bolt it after them. ,scorpio,Be forceful today. Put your own interests first. The Sun in Pisces is giving you a massive boost of confidence, so make the most of it and make sure everyone knows where you are coming from and what you intend to do. Then do it.
scorpio,You need to confront a fear that has been holding you back and you need to do it now. A little bit of courage will take you a long way, maybe all the way to a new life and a new way of looking at and thinking about the world.
scorpio,Avoid all kinds of wishful thinking over the next 48 hours. Only by taking a realistic attitude to your current situation, both professional and financial, will you come to a correct conclusion as to what needs to be done. Honesty with yourself is essential.
scorpio,Anything of a creative, artistic or romantic nature will go well this week. Even if you are one of those Scorpios who doesn’t like to court attention you will be assertive and ambitious over the next seven days. You can succeed and you will succeed.
scorpio,The Sun in Pisces makes this one of the best times of the year for you and when the Sun links with Jupiter next weekend you will get your reward for the efforts you have made. Between now and then though be patient. Good things will come.
scorpio,It’s time to put your own interests first and start work on something you have been thinking about for weeks, months, maybe even years. This is an excellent day for creative activities, so put your doubts behind you and follow your dream.
scorpio,There is a danger that what you say over the next 24 hours will be taken the wrong way and used against you at some stage in the future. Misunderstandings can be costly, so spell out what you mean in plain language. Leave nothing to chance.
scorpio,Keep your eye on the ball and keep your mind on what it is you are hoping to accomplish. If you can do that then you will succeed. The approaching new moon will give you added drive and dynamism. How can you lose? You can’t!,scorpio,It may annoy you that someone is saying things that are blatantly untrue but don’t let your anger show. The best approach is to pretend that you have not noticed and that you agree with every word they say. Then prove them wrong.
scorpio,Life is good and about to get even better. Both the new moon and a wonderful Sun-Jupiter link mean that Lady Luck is about to smile on you in a big way. There is no doubt at all you will get what you want – and soon!,scorpio,You have been far too negative and far too critical of your efforts of late. The good news is that when Jupiter moves in your favor again on Thursday your mood will improve dramatically. The meaning of life is to have fun, nothing more.
scorpio,How much confidence do you have in your abilities? Hopefully it’s a lot because with the Sun linked to your ruler Pluto there are going to be some big changes over the next few days – changes that affect you on a personal level.
scorpio,Try to avoid petty arguments, especially the sort that drag on for days. Yes, it may look to others as if you are taking the easy way out but the fact is you cannot be bothered to waste time on issues that don’t mean a thing to you.
scorpio,Venus, the planet that helps smooth over difficulties, moves into the domestic area of your chart today. If you are smart you will use its influence to reorder your home life in ways that suit your needs while not annoying or obstructing others.
scorpio,Don’t give in too easily today, especially on the work front where colleagues and employers will take advantage of you if you don’t stand up for yourself. You may want to do things for them but you really should not be doing everything.
scorpio,Someone you meet over the next two or three days will inspire you creatively and maybe romantically too. Will this new liaison stand the test of time? There is no way of knowing for sure but it will certainly be fun finding out!,scorpio,You may think you have been short-changed in some way but that isn’t true. If you make the most of what you have it won’t be long before you realize just how fortunate you have been. You haven’t been short-changed at all – you’ve been blessed.
scorpio,The Sun in Pisces makes you active in the extreme but other influences suggest you would benefit from taking life at a slower pace for a while. Instead of trying to make things happen try instead to understand what is already taking place.
scorpio,You won’t have to work too hard to get what you want this week. With both the Sun and Jupiter on your side others will happily provide you with whatever it is that is good for you. Hopefully it will be good for them too.
scorpio,The message of the stars for you today is that you must not start worrying for no good reason. The challenges that come your way over the next few days will be tough but you are ten times tougher. You’re better looking than your rivals too!,scorpio,If you do anything to excess between now and the full moon on the 16th you will most likely regret it, so tone down your act and don’t try so hard to impress friends and colleagues. You’re a star already, so shouldn’t they be trying to impress you?,scorpio,Saturn in your sign, linked to the Sun in Pisces, urges you to take life at a slower pace. What you achieve, over the next 24 hours or the next 24 years, will not be determined by speed but by staying power. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
scorpio,This is a good day to take care of the little, everyday things that need doing, both at home and at work. Don’t set yourself any grand targets, just get the small stuff done and leave the grand design to sort itself out. It always does.
scorpio,Tomorrow’s full moon warns you need to be careful when talking about your plans. The more information you give away the more likely it is that rivals will steal your ideas. What happened to that secretive Scorpio we all know and love?,scorpio,Not everyone will agree with the route you have chosen to take but that is irrelevant. Listen to what friends and family have to tell you this week but don’t think for a moment that you have to follow their advice. You know best.
scorpio,You may be fixed in your opinions but you are not the only one with strong beliefs. Disagreements of one sort or another are likely this week but that’s okay. New ideas may create tension but tension itself can be creative.
scorpio,According to the planets you are thinking too much about the past and not nearly enough about the future. Your task today is to switch your attention away from what was and toward what could be – and your options really are unlimited.
scorpio,You need to start thinking seriously about cutting back on the amount of work you are doing. The past few weeks have been a time of great activity and your momentum will keep you going for a while yet, but your body needs a break.
scorpio,It is one thing to be a hard worker but quite another to waste your time and energy on tasks that mean nothing to you personally. Your one and only aim today must be to decide what is important to you and what should be junked.
scorpio,Today’s lunar eclipse of Saturn in your sign suggests you are bursting to say things you know you should not. However, the longer you keep your thoughts and feelings bottled up inside the bigger the eventual explosion will be – so speak up.
scorpio,Others will slap you on the back and tell you what a wonderful job you are doing and, of course, they are right. But don’t let the praise go to your head because most likely they are only being nice because they want something from you.
scorpio,Don’t be afraid to take a few risks on the work front this week. The planets indicate you need to be more adventurous where your methods and routines are concerned. Just be careful you don’t overdo it and damage your health.
scorpio,It would appear that you are in possession of information that could be dangerous to the kind of people who would do almost anything to make sure it stays private. Unless you enjoy making enemies maybe you should keep it to yourself.
scorpio,You must carry on with a creative or artistic endeavor that you may have been thinking of giving up on completely. You don’t seem to realize how close you are to a breakthrough. If you give up now you may never forgive yourself.
scorpio,You will find it easy to work out what is going on in someone’s mind today, which in turn will help you decide what you should do next. You have a knack for seeing the kind of body language that other people miss. Make it work for you.
scorpio,Reach out to someone you have not seen or heard from in a while. Arrange a get-together in the very near future. Not only will you have plenty of gossip to catch up on – you may find your long-term plans coincide quite nicely too.
scorpio,If you need a break you must take one, no matter how much others might try to persuade you to work even harder. Even Scorpios need to relax and recharge their batteries every now and again, so be kind to yourself.
scorpio,If you owe someone a debt you must pay it off over the next few days. As a Scorpio you should know that it simply isn’t possible to wriggle out of these things – what goes around always comes around eventually, so pay it and move on. ,scorpio,If you take a negative view of what is going on you may get stuck in one of those woe-is-me moods that are so hard to shift. Make a conscious mental and emotional effort to look on the bright side today – it’s always there.
scorpio,Some of what you hear over the next 24 hours may be less than complimentary but in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance, so don’t let it upset your equilibrium. What happened to that famous Scorpio spirit?,scorpio,You may now be having second thoughts about something you recently agreed to but the fact is it’s too late to change things. Even if you were able to do so it would cost you too much in terms of time, money and damaged reputation.
scorpio,A relationship that has gone through some difficult times can be repaired but first you must ask yourself if that is what you truly desire. The Sun at odds with your ruler Pluto suggests you may be thinking of ending it once and for all.
scorpio,You are doing too many things for too many people and need to slow down a bit. If you carry on trying to do it all you are sure to burn yourself out, physically and emotionally, so stop catering to their every whim and fancy.
scorpio,Someone you thought you could trust has been misleading you, or at the very least keeping things from you that you ought to know about. But what was their motivation? Maybe they thought they were doing it for your own good.
scorpio,You may be desperate to show what you can do but don’t go over the top and do something silly. Why? Because it makes you an easy target for those who would like nothing better than to derail your ambitions. Think smart and act smart too.
scorpio,You need to recharge your physical, mental and emotional batteries, so don’t make too many plans for the next few days. In fact, if you can find ways to pamper yourself or, even better, get loved ones to pamper you, go for it.
scorpio,Try not to take what you see and hear personally today, not even if others make it clear it is meant to be personal. Yes, you know how to be vengeful, but sometimes it’s better to let annoying issues sail over your head.
scorpio,Focus on what seems right to you and ignore what the so-called “experts” tell you if it does not fit in with your way of thinking. Ultimately there are no such things as facts, there are only various shades of opinion, and yours deserve to be heard.
scorpio,For some strange reason you are wracked by self-doubt. For some strange reason you seem to believe you do not have the talent to be a success. That simply isn’t true. Get your head straight and get on with making your mark on the world.
scorpio,You may not understand why so many people are singing your praises at the moment but you must have done something to warrant being the center of attention. Don’t waste time thinking about it – milk the applause for all it’s worth.
scorpio,Try not to let your anxieties get the better of you. What looks like such a huge problem now will be swept away by what happens around the time of the lunar eclipse on the 15th. It’s all about perspective, so widen your horizons.
scorpio,Stick to the script and don’t be tempted to go off at a tangent. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your working environment where others will not take kindly to you disrupting routines without clearing it with them first.
scorpio,This is not a good time to make hasty decisions, not with Pluto, your ruler, beginning one of its retrograde phases. What seems like a good idea today may turn out later to be the one thing you should have avoided, so take care.
scorpio,Whatever happens today, be it good, bad or indifferent, you must treat it as if it is of no real importance in the greater scheme of things. Remember too that if you allow feelings to guide you then your fears will most likely take over.
scorpio,No matter how eager you may be to begin something you have every reason to believe will bring you fame and fortune it might be best to wait a bit. The Sun’s change of signs at the weekend could lead to a change in your priorities.
scorpio,There is a battle of wills going on at the moment, either in your career or your social circle, and it’s a battle you cannot afford to lose. Your sign has a reputation for ruthlessness and it’s something you should be looking to live up to.
scorpio,You will make sacrifices above and beyond the call of duty over the next 24 hours and everyone will be singing your praises. Virtue may be its own reward but that does not mean you can’t treat yourself too. What do you fancy?,scorpio,You are now about halfway through your solar year – the midpoint between one birthday and the next – and that makes this the ideal time to take stock of how far you have come. Then you’ll have a good idea how far there is still to go.
scorpio,Partnerships of all sorts are under good stars now and the next few days will bring opportunities to mend fences and get back on good terms with people you have fallen out with in recent months. Be the first to say “sorry” – they’ll appreciate it.
scorpio,You won’t hesitate to hit back if someone does you wrong today but the problem is you may hit back at the wrong person. Think before you act and, if you do make a mistake, apologize profusely the first chance you get.
scorpio,Everyone takes a wrong turning now and again, so don’t be surprised if the planets start nudging you in a new direction. There is an ideal path for you to take through life and in some way or other you will be reminded where it is today.
scorpio,It may feel as if you have no control over what is going on in your life but that simply isn’t true. What is true though is that you have allowed certain people to dictate to you what you can and cannot do. It’s time to make it clear that enough is enough.
scorpio,The planets indicate that you will gain more on every level if you take an easygoing attitude to getting your way. Aim high by all means but don’t think you have to force people to give you what it is you desire. They want you to have it.
scorpio,You won’t be shy about letting those you care for know how much they mean to you. Creatively, too, this should be a good day for you, so let your artistic side come to the fore – it will bring you and others a great deal of joy.
scorpio,Partners and loved ones seem to be making all the running at the moment while you follow on in their wake. But is that really so bad? You cannot expect to be a leader all of the time – sometimes you have to be a follower too.
scorpio,You will have to adapt to other people’s plans over the next few days but it’s really no big deal. Sometimes it’s best to sit back and let others call the shots. If they get it right, that’s great. If they get it wrong, you’re not to blame.
scorpio,Someone who is aggressive for no good reason is likely to bring out the worst in you today. No doubt they have not experienced a Scorpio’s sting before but it’s unlikely they will forget it. They’ll be a better person for it, and you’ll feel better too.
scorpio,You will be extremely energetic today but the solar eclipse in your opposite sign of Taurus means you cannot expect to get everything your own way. Some of your rivals are every bit as relentless as you. They’re probably Scorpios too!,scorpio,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Taurus means you won’t get far on your own over the next few days, so let partners and loved ones and work colleagues know you need and value their support. Together you can do amazing things.
scorpio,You have never been one for small talk and what others are wittering on about no doubt bores you to tears. Ignore them and focus your attention on what is important to you, even if no one else seems to agree. Rise above petty things.
scorpio,Some people may be obstructive today but you don’t have to make an issue of it. Treat it as an opportunity to show how patient and relaxed you can be. Truly! Others will be impressed by your remarkable self-control.
scorpio,The Sun links with your ruler Pluto this weekend to inspire you to go above and beyond your usual limits. Some people may try to frustrate your plans but they won’t come close to succeeding. When Scorpio wants something Scorpio gets it.
scorpio,You are who you are for a reason, so don’t let anyone not even people you love try to persuade you that you should change your ways. You don’t need to be different, you just need to be better at who you already are.
scorpio,If you do things by the book today you will get the rewards you deserve. If, however, you try to gain an advantage by cutting corners or telling lies most likely you will find that your underhand methods rebound on you in annoying ways.
scorpio,Someone you encounter on your travels will turn out to be a very important contact, both on a personal level and professionally. Make an effort to get out and about and meet people and, of course, talk to them. It’s not difficult.
scorpio,Over the next two or three days you will find it easier to get to grips with a financial matter that has been keeping you awake at night. Once you find out what the real problem is you will also find the courage to deal with it.
scorpio,The Sun in your opposite sign of Taurus means, among other things, that you have to put up with people who annoy you. Don’t be tempted to argue with them, about anything, because if you do the situation may quickly get out of hand.
scorpio,It does not matter how convinced you may be that you are in the right and others are in the wrong you won’t get far if you insist they come round to your way of thinking. Look for a compromise solution – it won’t be so hard to find.
scorpio,How you deal with other people over the next 48 hours will determine whether the next few weeks will be a time of achievement or of conflict. Try to remember you are not the only one with needs and desires – or with feelings either.
scorpio,You may find it hard to trust certain people but trust them you must. Yes, it is possible they might betray you but do you really want to let suspicion govern your every move? They’re not as bad as you think they are.
scorpio,This is a positive and potentially passionate time for you but to make the most of it you have got to be more outgoing. Let those you are attracted to know that you are interested – don’t put on your Scorpio poker face and leave them guessing.
scorpio,The next few days are mainly about relationships. Challenges must be dealt with and certain people must be told in no uncertain terms that you are the boss. Yes, compromise is possible, but only after you have established your authority.
scorpio,Today’s full moon in your sign will give you the energy you need to go your own way, do your own thing and, most importantly, stand up for your right to be different. If it means you fall out with certain people, well, that’s too bad.
scorpio,You could fall out with a work colleague or someone in authority today. It’s okay to fight your corner, of course, but be sure in your mind that you are right and they are wrong. If there’s any doubt it might be wise to back off.
scorpio,If you need to win someone over to your way of thinking, this is the time to bombard them with facts and figures that prove your case. You will convince them more easily, of course, if there is something financial in it for them.
scorpio,Before you reach a final decision about a long-term financial enterprise you must make sure you have all the facts at your fingertips. If you leave anything to chance there is a real possibility you will end up paying more than you should.
scorpio,If you are the kind of Scorpio who never gives much thought to the future then what happens over the next few days will impress on you the need to look ahead. Financial planning is a must, and that means saving more and spending less.
scorpio,You may think that life should come to you, that you are owed something by the world around you, but if that’s your attitude you will end the day disappointed. If there is something you desire make the effort to get it yourself.
scorpio,You’ll be a bit touchy as the new week begins, perhaps due to a vague fear that a work colleague is plotting against you. Most likely there is no truth in it at all, so don’t do or say anything that might really turn them against you.
scorpio,You seem to have got it into your head that you are entitled to something the world does not seem to want to give you. What happens today will make you realize that, in the long-term, you get only what you fight for.
scorpio,The planets warn you may fall prey to worries and anxieties that at most others times would not bother you in the slightest. Keep telling yourself that each and every one of them is an illusion. Reality is what YOU want it to be.
scorpio,The more you try to give up certain things you know are not good for you the more you end up indulging in them. Maybe that’s the only way. Maybe you need to wallow in what you desire until you desire it no more.
scorpio,This could be and should be a wonderful weekend for you. With Saturn in your sign making a perfect link to Jupiter, planet of good fortune, virtually everything you do will work out for the best – so make sure you do something big.
scorpio,You may have no choice over the next week or so but to tighten your belt financially and learn to live on less for a while. It won’t hurt as much as you think. The simple fact is you have been spending money on things you don’t need.
scorpio,What is the most important factor in success? It’s knowing what you want, and if you still don’t know what you are aiming to do with your life you must give it some serious thought this week. Ask yourself: what do I really desire?,scorpio,The upcoming new moon will give you the motivation and energy you need to make a start on a project you have been flirting with for weeks, months, maybe even years. There can be no more excuses: it’s time to get it done.
scorpio,If you have been thinking of ways to make money now is the time to come to a decision about what your strategy is going to be. What you start over the next few days will reap rich rewards during the second half of the year.
scorpio,Your creative powers will be at their height over the next 24 hours, so make good use of them. Also, take your pleasures where you find them and don’t listen to those who say you should be more cautious. Where’s the fun in that!,scorpio,You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party and with Saturn in your sign it’s unlikely you will win any prizes for popularity. But do you care? Of course not! You rather enjoy being the odd one out – it makes you feel special.
scorpio,You have a secret desire to do something you know will not go down well with certain people but if you don’t do it you will most likely kick yourself later for being too timid. What are you afraid of? Surely not what others might say?,scorpio,The most important thing now is that you play by the rules. If you stray from the straight and narrow over the next few days your rivals – and you have a few – will make sure you pay for it. Make certain your tactics are squeaky clean.
scorpio,If you are in any way dishonest when dealing with other people today they will be dishonest with you later on. You don’t need to tell lies or cut corners to get what you need, so make sure what you say and do is above suspicion.
scorpio,Be careful you don’t lose your sense of perspective and get angry about something that would not usually bother you in the slightest. And don’t worry too much if you lose out financially either – you’ll more than make up for it later.
scorpio,You seem to be under quite a bit of pressure at the moment and that pressure will build over the next few days. Make life easier by taking nothing too seriously, least of all yourself. Treat each challenge you face as a game. Win with a smile.
scorpio,Stay calm and keep telling yourself that everything will come right in the end – somehow it always does. Above all don’t allow yourself to get worked up about money matters. There is no reason at all to fear the worst.
scorpio,You may find it hard to admit you were wrong about something but you have no choice in the matter. If you have been found out for playing fast and loose with the truth you must admit it and promise not to let it happen again.
scorpio,No doubt you have big plans and no doubt you have made all sorts of promises to yourself. This time you WILL get your act together and accomplish great things. The only danger is you may aim too high. Make sure your ambitions are realistic.
scorpio,Don’t rush into a decision concerning a money matter or a business issue. That sense of urgency you feel is caused by the approaching full moon and is not to be trusted. If you’re not certain then wait – it won’t cost you a cent. ,scorpio,You will have a few bruises come the end of the week and maybe one or two by the end of the day. It is inevitable there will be some kind of falling out but in the greater scheme of things it’s not such a big deal. Keep smiling.
scorpio,There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. What will be will be, so let go of your fears and doubts and start thinking of life as a great and exciting adventure – because that is precisely what it is.
scorpio,You may want to tear everything down and start again from scratch but is that really necessary? You may regret it in the long-term if you destroy what you have created. There is room in your life for both the old and the new.
scorpio,The approaching full moon warns that your big ideas, while potentially profitable, need to be brought down to earth a little. Inject some reality into your thinking over the next two or three days – you won’t get rich on dreams alone.
scorpio,There is no reason why you should not go out and have a good time but that does not mean you have to buy drinks for everyone. You have been far too generous of late, so let someone else get the check for a change.
scorpio,You need to get serious about something you tended to treat in an offhand manner in the past. Only you know for certain what that something happens to be – and you also know if you don’t do it now it may never get done.
scorpio,A battle of wills cannot be avoided and you MUST be the one who wins it. The outcome will decide not only the level of freedom you get to enjoy for the next few weeks but for the remainder of the year as well.
scorpio,You need to get your financial affairs in order. If you need to cut costs then do what has to be done, even if it affects your quality of life in the short-term. The longer you leave it the harder it will be to make changes.
scorpio,It will pay you to be skeptical today, especially when dealing with people who in some way or other depend on your generosity. Whatever it is they suggest make sure the figures add up and you are 100 per cent happy with it.
scorpio,Even if you are the sort of Scorpio who likes to stick with tried and tested methods try to be more adventurous over the next 24 hours. Take a chance on love too. A new attraction could sweep you off your feet and transform your existence!,scorpio,Make sure you get your chores out of the way as quickly as possible over the next 24 hours. If you let what should have been done today wait until tomorrow you will fall behind and may never catch up. Don’t put yourself under pressure.
scorpio,You may be tempted to end a relationship that has been going through stormy seas of late but is that really a wise move? To be on the safe side wait until the Sun changes signs tomorrow. You may find that your attitude changes too.
scorpio,Now that your financial situation is not so bad it may be tempting to go on a spree but hopefully your serious Scorpio nature will stop you from doing anything stupid. There are plenty of ways you can have fun without spending money.
scorpio,It may seem that someone is going out of their way to make life difficult for you but most likely you are overreacting. Don’t say or do anything that might start a feud and try to remember that few things in life are straightforward.
scorpio,You may be a bit touchy where money and possessions are concerned today. However, the planets indicate you have precious little to worry about, so lighten up and believe that it will all come right in the end – it usually does.
scorpio,You may be in the mood to change things but the planets warn there are some things it might be wiser to leave as they are for the time being. Make changes for a reason, not just because you can (or because it annoys other people!).
scorpio,Someone will pull rank on you today but don’t get uptight about it because there is nothing you can do to change things. Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself, no matter how tempted you may be to speak your mind.
scorpio,Some people complain that they never get the breaks but you know that is rarely true. What you get out of life has to be earned and over the next two or three days you will find that the more you give the more you get in return.
scorpio,Because today’s new moon falls in one of the more expansive areas of your chart your thoughts will be remarkably positive. That’s good. What you think about now will be your reality later on, so focus only on your highest ideals.
scorpio,The obstacles you face may be daunting but you have the know-how and the energy to overcome each and every one of them. Do not try to avoid what fate sends your way this weekend – go on the attack instead.
scorpio,Don’t cut yourself off from other people over the next few days. Remind yourself at every opportunity that you are part of a greater whole and that no matter where you go or what you do you will never truly be alone.
scorpio,The more others try to intimidate you today the more you must stick to your guns. They are only criticizing you this much because they fear that your ambitious plans might succeed. Stay calm and carry on – it’s the Scorpio way.
scorpio,Chances are certain people have been leaving out facts and figures that could have made a difference to the decisions you made. Should you get angry? Well, you have every right, but has anything bad actually come of it? If no, let it go.
scorpio,You may not want to hurt someone’s feelings but you know you have to be honest with them. There comes a time when it is necessary to tell it like it is, even if it means putting a relationship or friendship at risk. That time is now.
scorpio,What happens today will bring a chance to make some much-needed cash but to get it you are going to have to be less conservative in your money-making ventures. You don’t have to gamble as such but try to be open to alternative possibilities.
scorpio,If there are any loose ends in your affairs, at home or at work, you must deal with them over the next 24 hours. If you leave them flapping in the breeze they are sure to trip you up sooner or later – most likely sooner.
scorpio,There is no point getting annoyed about things you cannot change. Even if you are the kind of Scorpio who believes that negative feelings should be expressed, there is no point getting too emotional. You need a cool mind, not a hot heart.
scorpio,Okay, so you made a mistake, but so what? Mistakes are evidence that you are doing something, or at least trying to do something. No matter how many times you fail in the short-term you will succeed in the end – big time!,scorpio,The planets urge you to take a less provocative approach when dealing with people you have been in disagreement with. Your differences are not so wide that you cannot find areas where you both can agree. But you’ve got to look.
scorpio,Today’s link-up between the Sun and Uranus means you won’t hesitate to strike out in a new direction or try your hand at new activities. You have played safe too many times of late. Life is too short for not taking chances.
scorpio,Both at home and at work you will have to watch what you say over the next 24 hours as there are some pretty fragile egos out there. You don’t need to make more enemies – you’ve got enough as it is – so think before you speak.
scorpio,There is no point making a fuss today, not even if you can prove you have been hard done by. Sometimes we have to take what we are given and make the best of it and this is one of those times. You’ll triumph in the end.
scorpio,Sometimes even a Scorpio has to sit back and wait for things to happen and that is the message of the stars for you now. Rest your mind and your body today because you are going to need every bit of your energy tomorrow.
scorpio,Travel plans and social activities are under stressful influences at the moment, so don’t expect everything to go your own way this weekend. You may experience delays and disappointments now but early next week you’ll be surging ahead again.
scorpio,Someone important will take you under their wing over the next few days and show you how to make the most of your talents. What you learn from them in the weeks and months ahead is sure to bring fame and fortune.
scorpio,Your imaginative powers will be strong today but that will only be good news if you have a positive attitude too. If you allow the unknown to scare you then what goes on over the next 24 hours will send you scurrying for cover.
scorpio,It might be wise to keep some of your more outrageous opinions to yourself over the next 24 hours. They may not be outrageous to you, of course, but not everyone shares your ability to see what is really going on in the world.
scorpio,Money worries will recede over the next few days as you focus more on making a success of your work or career. Why not treat yourself to a night on the town with your friends or your family? Yes, you can afford it.
scorpio,This is the ideal time to let your mind wander a bit because it will lead you in some interesting new directions. If you find it hard to get inspired try connecting with people who make you feel good about yourself – they’ll give you ideas.
scorpio,You seem to be pushing yourself harder than ever of late but will achieve more in the long-term if you balance your physical and mental efforts with plenty of relaxation. Treat yourself to a massage or a day at the spa.
scorpio,You like to be on the winning side but finishing ahead of your rivals isn’t the most important thing. If you get the chance to assist someone who is down on their luck you should take it. Helping others feel good will help you feel great.
scorpio,The Sun’s change of signs on Tuesday will make you even more ambitious than you were before, if that is possible. There are no limits to what you can achieve now, so give yourself permission to dream – and dream big.
scorpio,Don’t hesitate to tell others what it is you desire because someone might hand it to you on a plate. Stranger things have happened and will continue to happen over the next few weeks, so be ready and expect anything – and everything!,scorpio,Your self-esteem will receive some kind of boost over the next 24 hours, making it easier for you to deal with important people. The thing to bear in mind is that the powers that be want you to succeed and you must want it too.
scorpio,Everyone has a story worth hearing and if you pay attention to what a friend or colleague tells you today you will learn something to your advantage. At the very least you will avoid making the same kind of mistake.
scorpio,Current influences will give a much-needed boost to your ambitions but success won’t just land in your lap. You will have to work for your rewards but that’s okay because no one has more strength and stamina than Scorpio. Go for it!,scorpio,It’s not like you to let others have the last word but it will pay you to do so today. Even if you can quite easily prove someone wrong you are advised not to do so because they will remember it and harbor thoughts of revenge.
scorpio,As Mars moves into your birth sign this weekend you may be tempted to tear everything down and start again from scratch but is that such a good idea? Don’t waste all your previous efforts – strengthen them and build on them.
scorpio,It is not enough to assume that other people know what you are talking about – spell it out for them in plain and simple language so there can be no confusion. You have an important message to convey, so make the effort and get it right.
scorpio,Stop worrying what other people might think about you. You are who you are for a good cosmic reason and no one has any right to suggest you be something else. That won’t stop them trying, of course, but they can’t force you to listen.
scorpio,The planets make it easy for you to approach people in positions of power today but if you have some kind of proposal to make it must be well thought out because they won’t be impressed if it is easy to pick holes in your plan.
scorpio,If you approach a task in a negative frame of mind today then, inevitably, you won’t much enjoy it. But if you can find a way to pretend you have been really looking forward to it then it might surprise you how easy it is.
scorpio,Try something you have never done before, something risky and maybe even a little bit outrageous. Others may not approve but, if anything, that will make you even more determined to go through with it. Scorpios can be SO stubborn!,scorpio,What is your number one ambition in life? Are you close to making it come true? If not, don’t worry because the planets promise there is plenty of time. Take each day as it comes and move forward one step at a time. You’ll get there.
scorpio,By all means look up to someone but don’t for a minute believe that they can do no wrong – because they will prove you wrong! The planets warn that your respect for a certain individual is based more on emotion than logic.
scorpio,Make it your aim over the next few days to identify the two or three goals that mean the most to you – then focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Play to your strengths. The more intense you are the more successful you will be.
scorpio,Usually you are happy to stand aside and let others argue the toss about trivial issues but according to the planets something small has got you riled in a big way and you intend to have your say. Watch out world – Scorpio’s on the warpath!,scorpio,Authority figures will be impressed by your ability not only to get things done but to get along with a wide range of people while doing it. You will make difficult tasks looks easy – and make yourself look good – over the next 24 hours.
scorpio,The approaching full moon will make everyone a bit touchy over the next few days, so make allowances for them and make allowances for yourself as well. By this time next week most people, you included, will be cool and calm again.
scorpio,Mars in your sign indicates that the quickest way to get the results you desire is to go all out to transform your current situation. Drastic decisions will have to be made and, having made them, your life won’t be the same again – but much, much better.
scorpio,A career change of some kind is likely very soon. Whether it is a change you make for yourself or a change that is forced on you remains to be seen but if you do feel so inclined then by all means make the first move.
scorpio,Some of the best partnerships are between people who appear to have little in common, so don’t turn down an invitation this weekend just because it’s from someone you find a bit weird. Chances are it will be a huge success.
scorpio,It seems you are trying too hard to please one particular person and because of that other people are beginning to feel neglected. That may not be your intention but you need to be more even-handed, or at least pretend to be.
scorpio,You must knuckle down and get something you promised you would finish out of the way before the end of the day. Once it is done you can forget about it completely and turn to the things you want to do with a clear conscience.
scorpio,It won’t be long before you have to make a choice between a personal relationship and your work. You won’t have to give up one for the other as such but you will need to focus in a single direction. It’s about to get serious.
scorpio,You have a reputation for keeping your head in difficult situations and it’s a reputation that will be called on at some point today. Whatever it is that excites other people it won’t move you in the slightest. You’re rock solid.
scorpio,You have the power to reach out and take whatever it is you want to possess, so what are you waiting for? Don’t let other people’s doubts hold you back because if you hesitate the chance will be gone. Seize the moment!,scorpio,More than any other sign you have the power to make things happen, not least by using your ability to influence how people think. Your task today, and over the weekend, is to point out new possibilities . Be a catalyst for change. ,scorpio,Someone you socialize with is secretly jealous of your popularity. That won’t mean anything to you so long as they don’t try to talk you down but if they do you must act fast. Rumors, no matter how wrong, can spread amazingly fast.
scorpio,Anyone who tries to trick you over the next two or three days will find out just how unwise it can be to play games with a Scorpio. You have a knack for knowing when others are up to no good – and you’re not afraid to act on it.
scorpio,You may feel good about yourself but not everyone is as positive as you and someone you love is in need of a confidence booster. Use your sharp wit to bring back the smile to their face. They won’t be feeling under the weather for long.
scorpio,You may want to show that you can manage on your own but today’s challenges are likely to be severe, so see sense and make sure you have back-up from friends and family before taking on what may be too much for you alone.
scorpio,Don’t give up on something just because you have grown bored with it. Certain tasks may be a bit of a grind but that does not mean they have to be tedious. Use your intelligence to find ways to spice them up a bit.
scorpio,No one has the right to tell you what to believe and what not to believe and if they try you must come down on them hard. Having said that, you may find that something you used to believe in no longer seems quite so certain.
scorpio,You will finish what you are working on a lot quicker if you get help. You may think you can do it all on your own but you are kidding no one but yourself. Share the effort – and there will be plenty of glory to share as well.
scorpio,Try to find common ground with a group of people you have not always seen eye-to-eye with in the past. You actually share many things in common and if you can overcome your more obvious differences you can do great things together.
scorpio,Stay on good terms with the people you work with. The planets warn if you try to improve your position at someone else’s expense, not only will you fail but you will make an enemy for life. You can do without that.
scorpio,You could be a bit too aggressive today, which could have unintended consequences. Try not to take anything too seriously and try not to take what others say personally. Once you lose your cool you will have a hard time finding it again.
scorpio,Like it or not you will have to adapt to what other people do – no way will they even consider adapting to you! Fortunately, with Mercury moving in your favor there won’t be so many misunderstandings as there have been in recent weeks.
scorpio,You will get more done over the next two days than you usually get done in two weeks, but don’t run yourself ragged. You have your limits like everyone else and if you go too far beyond them you will end up paying the price.
scorpio,Today’s moon-Saturn link could have a negative effect on your self-image. You don’t think you are as skilled or experienced as your rivals? Well you’re wrong. You have what it takes and more besides. Believe in yourself and make things happen. ,scorpio,Mars in your sign makes you want to get things done in the world, but other aspects suggest it might be smart to withdraw from the everyday hustle and bustle for a while. Act less but think more over the next few days.
scorpio,There is a danger that in your enthusiasm to show what you can do you will take on too many tasks and spread yourself too thin. Focus on the one thing you are naturally good at today. Make your number one talent your fortune.
scorpio,Friends and social activities will bring you luck over the next 24 hours, so don’t sit at home doing nothing, get out into the world and make an impression. The more attention you get, personally and professionally, the more you will accomplish.
scorpio,There is a task of some kind you have yet to complete and over the next 24 hours you must decide whether to carry on with it or whether to give up on it. Clearly it doesn’t inspire you enough, so why not just let it go?,scorpio,You cannot go on trying to achieve everything alone – it just isn’t going to work. With Venus moving into the friendship area of your chart this weekend making alliances will come easy to you – so don’t be so stand-offish!,scorpio,The best way to deal with an emotional problem is to throw yourself into activities which keep both your mind and your body occupied. The less you think about your problems the more distant they will become. Eventually they will disappear.
scorpio,If you decide to get more deeply involved in some kind of movement or cause you must go all the way – there can be no half measures. Serious subjects require a serious attitude – and they don’t come more serious than Scorpio!,scorpio,A secret admirer will be secret no longer by the end of the day. If your feelings for them are as strong as their feelings for you this will be a marvelous week. If not . . . find a way to put them off without being brutal.
scorpio,You are going through a positive phase at the moment, so if there are things in your life you want to change now is the time. Some people will try to dissuade you but only because they fear you will leave them behind. They’re right, you will.
scorpio,No matter how attached you are to a particular idea, something will happen over the next 24 hours that forces you to think again. Could it be you took certain things for granted that you now realize were simply not true? Yes, it could.
scorpio,You may be convinced that your way of doing things is best but you still need to explain and justify your actions to partners and co-workers if you want to get important things done. They won’t just follow you out of blind loyalty you know!,scorpio,This will be a day of fun and pleasant surprises, but make the most of it because Mars will be disrupting things a bit over the weekend. If you think there is something you can do to reduce the chances of disorder then do it now.
scorpio,If money matters are in a bit of a muddle at the moment don’t worry, you will soon get the chance to sort things out. Mars in the money area of your chart over the next few weeks will force you to get serious about your finances.
scorpio,Try changing your point of view this week. Often by looking at an issue from a different angle the solution becomes obvious, and that applies to work problems as much as it does to personal matters. Never allow your viewpoint to harden. Always be flexible.
scorpio,Think positively about what you are required to do by people in positions of authority. It may not be what you want to do but the bottom line is they have the power and you do not. Don’t start a battle you cannot possibly win.
scorpio,You may be unaware that someone is annoyed with you but you’ll find out soon enough. If a loved one or work colleague gives you a hard time over the next 24 hours try to find out why. Was it something you said or did?,scorpio,Are you delighted with what you have achieved? Or are you saddened because you wasted so many opportunities? Either way you should not get too worked up about it. You will always get another chance – and another, and another after that.
scorpio,What you get over the next 24 hours may not be what you want precisely but according to the planets it is exactly what you need. If a friend makes a suggestion you would be wise to take it seriously. They know what you need too.
scorpio,Something that made perfect sense a short while ago now seems to make no sense at all and it’s immensely frustrating. Don’t worry about it. A day or two from now you will have forgotten why you thought it was so important.
scorpio,You need to be open and honest about your desires. Being a secretive Scorpio it won’t come easy to you but unless you let others know how you feel they won’t be able to respond the way you want them to respond. At least drop a few hints.
scorpio,You won’t find it easy to express yourself over the next 24 hours, but that’s okay – you’re not exactly renowned for your conversation. Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself and only speak when what you have to say is of real importance.
scorpio,It does not matter how much you own or how much you earn – if you are happy with your lot then you don’t need a lot. Bear that thought in mind over the next few days. Material things are not important but emotional and spiritual things are.
scorpio,The difficulties you are encountering are not designed to weaken you but to toughen you up for the challenges that lie ahead. The Sun in Libra over the next few weeks will pose many questions, but deep down you already know all the answers.
scorpio,Although today’s new moon takes place in the most sensitive area of your chart there is nothing you should be too worried about. You may have to give up something you are attached to but deep down you know it’s no longer worth the effort.
scorpio,Domestic and work arrangements may change at a moment’s notice today, but that’s okay. You are adaptable enough to change with them and make it all seem effortless – which won’t go unnoticed by people in positions of power.
scorpio,Saturn in your sign does not seem quite so restrictive of late but that does not mean you can loosen your hold on the purse strings. In a matter of days a new source of income will present itself – then you can have a bit of a splurge.
scorpio,Your ability to satisfy your desires this weekend will be in direct proportion to your ability to communicate what it is you are after. Spell out to others what it is you need in plain and simple language and the universe will make it happen.
scorpio,You may have to guard against disappointment over the next few days, not because you have anything to be disappointed about as such but because the Sun in Libra at this time of year makes you fear the worst. Don’t worry, it won’t happen.
scorpio,What would you change in your life if you knew you had the power to make it happen? Whatever that something happens to be you must start thinking and feeling as if it will do whatever you tell it to do. Your mind creates your reality.
scorpio,Don’t give up on a new enterprise because it is more difficult than you expected it to be. You know from experience that the more you practice something the easier it becomes, so give it time. Don’t expect too much of yourself too soon.
scorpio,What you do in private today is more important than what you do in public, especially as it will help build emotional bonds with people you may have neglected in recent months. Fame may be fun but it can’t beat real human contact.
scorpio,It seems you are having second thoughts about some kind of plan or project. Yes, it’s going to be tougher than you expected. Have faith in your abilities and be willing to work harder than everyone else. You’ll triumph eventually.
scorpio,The best way to handle a delicate situation is to be brutal with it. That may sound all wrong but the planets indicate that you have been pussy-footing round an issue when you should have got to grips with it. You don’t need tact, you need action.
scorpio,A goal you have been working towards will soon be in front of you and you will be so pleased you stuck it through to the end. Unlike some people you never give in and there are sure to be a few envious eyes on you this weekend.
scorpio,You may not see the point in what you are being asked to do but you will do it anyway, simply because you accept it as your duty. It’s a shame more people are not as principled and committed as you. The world would be a better place.
scorpio,Your enthusiasm for a plan or project is likely to wane over the next few days, but that’s okay. You gave it your best shot and that is all you can ask of yourself. Not even a Scorpio can get it spot on every time.
scorpio,There is no need for regrets or remorse. You cannot turn the clock back so you might as well set your sights on the future and make it the best it can possibly be. Yesterday is gone and today will follow it soon – it’s tomorrow that matters.
scorpio,What happens today may be a challenge to your ego but no way is it going to break you, so don’t fret. These are difficult times but you can make things easier for yourself by going with the flow rather than fighting against it.
scorpio,Because mind planet Mercury is moving retrograde at the moment it will take a concentrated mental effort not to give in to feelings of doom and gloom. It is an effort worth making, because there are so many wonderful things to look forward to.
scorpio,Take time out today to ponder the decision you are about to make. Is it really what you want? Are you acting rationally or are your emotions involved? If you are not completely convinced you are doing the right thing then maybe you should wait.
scorpio,Whatever plans or schedules you may have drawn up in recent weeks you are advised to rip them all up and dump them in the waste bin. Changes will come thick and fast over the next few days, so try just to live in the moment.
scorpio,You may not know why a hunch is so strong but you know better than to ignore it. You won’t know for certain if you have made the right choice until later in the week but deep down you can sense you are on to a winner.
scorpio,You know what needs to be done to improve your status, so why are you holding back? Maybe it’s because you realize, deep down, that status is not so important after all, especially if you have to sacrifice your principles to get it.
scorpio,Withdraw from the hustle and bustle of life and find room to think and feel more deeply than has been the case of late. Just over a week from now a new solar year begins for you, so make sure your head and your heart are in a good place.
scorpio,Yes, times may be tough but it’s nothing you cannot handle. As the Sun nears the end of one Scorpio solar cycle you must expect things to be a bit gray and glum but it’s okay: a few days from now your fortunes will be transformed.
scorpio,The planets will help you see through the web of deceit that certain people have created and by the end of the day you will have no doubt what the truth is. After that it is simply a question of what you are going to do about it.
scorpio,Today’s cosmic set-up warns you cannot afford to be half-hearted or only half involved. Friends and family and work colleagues expect total commitment and you owe it to them to give 100 per cent. Fortunately, a Scorpio rarely gives less.
scorpio,The Sun’s move into your birth sign on Thursday is followed immediately by a solar eclipse – an excellent omen of personal and professional success. Decide what it is you want to improve in your life, then just do it. Yes, it really is that easy. ,scorpio,You seem to be having serious misgivings about what a friend or family member is proposing to do and it is your duty to speak up about it. They may resent your interference now but later on they will thank you profusely.
scorpio,The next few weeks promise to be both happy and exciting. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse in your sign will do wonders for your confidence and give you the courage to start something that could and should transform your existence. Be bold.
scorpio,The Sun enters your birth sign today and there is also a powerful eclipse in your sign, so the omens are good, in fact they are excellent. There are genuinely no limits to what you can accomplish over the next four weeks or so.
scorpio,Life moves in never-ending cycles and because the cycle you have now entered on is positive in the extreme you have every right to feel pleased with yourself. You don’t have to do anything special today, just be yourself – and smile often.
scorpio,If you feel the urge to get out and about and socialize a bit then by all means do so. Mars, planet of energy, moves into the most restless area of your chart this weekend, so go where your instincts take you and enjoy every moment of it.
scorpio,Mars, planet of action and energy, moves into the most outgoing area of your chart on your birthday, making is easier for you to reach out to other people. Be daring and dynamic by all means but don’t forget about feelings – your own and other people’s. ,scorpio,Whatever happened to all those plans and promises you made to yourself earlier in the year? Whatever the answer the good news is you are now in the ideal position to do something about them. Go after your dream. Better late than never.
scorpio,Neptune, planet of imagination, is strong on your birthday this year, so listen to what your inner voice tells you, then act on it as if it is the most natural thing in the world. All things are possible. If you can visualize it you can create it – it’s really that simple.
scorpio,Don’t worry if you have been feeling a bit disillusioned of late because what happens over the next 12 months will remind you how good life can be. It will be even better if you shift your focus away from material things and towards people and relationships.
scorpio,It may at seems seem as if your life is going nowhere but that isn’t true – in fact you are making amazing progress. Your plan for the coming year must be to get the most from each passing moment. The future is not tomorrow, the future is right now.
scorpio,You may strongly disagree with someone’s views but keep your feelings about it to yourself. Once you get into an argument it could snowball faster than you expected and neither you nor your opponent is in the mood to back down. Trouble,scorpio,A Sun-Pluto link on your birthday will endow you with all the confidence and all the energy you need to do remarkable things over the coming 12 months. One thing you do need is to socialize more with like-minded people. Together you are unbeatable,scorpio,The more someone tells you that your plans are not going to work the more determined you will be to see them through to completion. You feel you have something to prove, not only to them but to yourself as well.
scorpio,A difficult situation is set to continue for some while yet – all you can do is soldier on and deal with it as best you can. Changes may be worrying but in the long-term you will be glad you were forced to move in a new direction. ,scorpio,Today’s full moon in your opposite sign suggests that a relationship of some kind is going through a bumpy phase. Don’t give up on it yet because a few days from now you will look back and realize how trivial your differences are.
scorpio,The intensity of your feelings can no longer be denied or disguised. You may have purposely kept your distance from someone because you did not know how you might react but the planets will throw you together today. Your relationship is fated.
scorpio,As mind planet Mercury moves into your sign you will at last be able to understand things that in the past left you confused. But don’t fall into the trap of thinking you know it all – there is always something new to learn.
scorpio,You may want to tell people what you are up to and what you expect to achieve but the planets suggest you would be wise to keep it to yourself for a few more days. You don’t want their negative reactions to disappoint you.
scorpio,You should by now have overcome whatever fears and worries were holding you back, but if something is still bothering you then you must deal with it today. Pluto will help you to be ruthless with yourself – but you must be kind to other people.
scorpio,Don’t be afraid to explore ideas that certain people say should be out of bounds. If you let them set the agenda then you put yourself at a massive disadvantage. You are under no obligation to think or feel as they do.
scorpio,You seem to be living a charmed life at the moment – you can apparently talk your way out of any and every difficult situation. Be that as it may don’t say things you know are not true merely for the fun of it. There will be consequences.
scorpio,No matter who depends on you there are certain things you must do for yourself over the next 24 hours. An opportunity to improve your status and reputation must be seized immediately or someone else will take it and benefit at your expense.
scorpio,Every new turn you take seems to lead further away from what you are aiming for, which is frustrating. Could it be that your subconscious mind is trying to warn you that what you are aiming for is perhaps not so desirable? Think about it.
scorpio,Don’t waste time arguing about things that will never make much of a difference. It may feel as if certain people are deliberately trying to wind you up – and maybe they are – but you should take it all in your stride. That’s life.
scorpio,So long as you are neither too anxious nor too confident this week you will make amazing progress. Tuesday’s Sun-Saturn link suggests a reward very much worth having for all your recent efforts. You worked for it, so you deserve it.
scorpio,Your mind is awash with brilliant ideas but you seem reluctant to do much with them. Maybe that’s because you don’t want to begin new projects in a rush of enthusiasm only to lose interest in them later. Take your time and get it right.
scorpio,If you want to achieve something special between now and the end of the year then you must set yourself targets that are not too easy to reach. Today’s Sun-Saturn link in your sign means you are capable of efforts above and beyond the norm.
scorpio,With so much energy at your disposal right now you don’t have to stick to the same old routines. Whatever natural talents you possess – and you possess more than most people – you can and you must make them work for you. ,scorpio,You can charm the birds out of the trees if you put your mind to it today. Some situations call for subtlety, some call for assertiveness, but whatever circumstances you face over the next 24 hours you’ll come up smelling of roses. ,scorpio,You have never been the sort to worry too much about what other people think of you, and that’s good. You would, however, be wise to pay attention to a loved one’s criticisms today. If you are honest you will admit they have a point.
scorpio,Just because someone occupies a position of power does not mean they have to be obeyed without question. On the contrary, if you can see they are abusing their position you have a duty to speak up. Are you brave enough to do that? ,scorpio,You cannot change the past but you can change the way you react to events in the here and now. Focus on what you have to do today and let tomorrow take care of itself. The less you worry now the better the future will be.
scorpio,You need to be careful as the new week begins because if you allow yourself to be taken in by soft words or a pretty face you could find later on that you have been duped. It may pay you to be a bit suspicious. ,scorpio,An important relationship will take a turn for the better over the next 24 hours, especially if you openly communicate your feelings. Loved ones will be more responsive to your needs if they are confident they know what they are. ,scorpio,You have made a lot of sacrifices in recent weeks and today’s Mercury-Saturn union in your sign indicates there is something else you must do before you can move on to pastures new. Do what is expected of you and do it with a smile.
scorpio,What happens over the next 24 hours will confirm what you have long suspected – that it is a mistake to limit yourself in any way. Old ways of doing things are unlikely to make your world better – but new methods will.
scorpio,As Mercury moves into the money area of your chart today you are free to make changes to your financial or business situation. Yes, of course, you will have to take other people’s needs into account but your own needs must still come first.
scorpio,The most important thing this weekend is that you raise your sights, not just a bit but to the highest possible level. There is no limit to what you can achieve but it’s unlikely you will get far if you keep selling yourself short. Be brilliant!,scorpio,Usually you are choosy about your companions but for some reason you don’t seem to care who you hang out with at the moment. That’s your choice, of course, but watch out you don’t get caught up in trouble that is not of your making.
scorpio,An objective may not have been within your reach in the past but it will certainly be within your reach over the next few days. All you have to do is put a name to your dream and then extend your hand to grasp it. ,scorpio,There is no point throwing yourself at something you simply don’t enjoy doing. The planets indicate that it may be time for a change – and a big change at that. What is it that YOU want to do? Then do it, and nothing else!  ,scorpio,Don’t deny yourself anything over the next 24 hours. If you crave for something then let yourself have it. Yes, there may be a touch of guilt involved but that will only add to your enjoyment. You like to break the rules. ,scorpio,You may be in a serious frame of mind at the moment but not everyone shares your solemn outlook, nor is there any reason why they should. Have you considered the possibility that they’ve got it right and you’ve got it wrong? ,scorpio,You may be rather emotional over the next two or three days but what of it? Even a Libra is allowed to shed a few tears now and again – and the planets indicate they are just as likely to be tears of joy as tears of sorrow.
scorpio,You may be tempted to make a commitment of some kind but with a particularly sensitive full moon this weekend you are advised to leave it a while. You are more likely to make a correct decision early next week when your mind is clear.
scorpio,You need to look beneath the surface of events if you want to find out what is really going on. The signposts may be subtle and easily missed out but no one is better than Scorpio at digging deep to find the hidden truth.
scorpio,Whatever challenges you are faced with over the next few days you will attack them and batter them into submission. But don’t get carried away and take on something (or someone) that is out of your league. Even a Scorpio has limits.
scorpio,You need to let go of things you no longer need, especially things that have become a drain on your time and energy. You don’t have to ask anyone’s permission to make changes – it’s your life, so take full control of it. ,scorpio,What you say today will have far-reaching effects for months to come, so think before you speak and strive to be positive at all times. You don’t have to lie to people but you should certainly talk up what’s good and play down what’s bad. ,scorpio,Look and act confident today, even though you may not feel it inside. If your rivals detect fear they will be after you in an instant. Keep telling yourself that you have what it takes to succeed. Say it enough and you will start to believe it.
scorpio,You need to tie up a number of loose ends today if you are to get the full benefit of what occurs over the weekend. Resolve your differences with colleagues at work and bring a project to a speedy and successful conclusion.
scorpio,You can easily get what you want this weekend, simply by asking the right people in the right way. You have so much charm at your disposal now that there is precious little anyone will deny you. Does that get you thinking? It should!,scorpio,You will find it very difficult to hide your feelings this week, much as you might want to. Something will happen that annoys you so much that you can’t help but have a go at those you believe are responsible – and you are right to do so.
scorpio,Let everyone know what you expect of them today. Some may grumble and say you are exceeding your powers, and maybe you are, but rather that than have them think you are weak. You’re a Scorpio – you are supposed to be domineering! ,scorpio,The more others say something cannot be done the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Just be careful you don’t take on something that is beyond even your formidable powers to make a success of. ,scorpio,If you have something on your mind you must let others know about it. Yes, you may go too far and make more of it than you should but that is preferable to not going far enough and giving the impression that everything is okay. ,scorpio,Someone you work or do business with will disagree with your plans today but there is no way you are going to change them. Smile sweetly and tell them you understand their concerns – then carry on exactly the same as before. ,scorpio,A loved one will demand that you spend more time with them today and if you are smart you will agree. This is one of those occasions when if you’re nice to them now they will be even nicer to you later. It’s a sacrifice worth making.
scorpio,As the Sun moves into the communication area of your chart this weekend you should have no trouble putting across your point of view. Say what you have to say simply and don’t force others to agree with you. They’ll “get it” eventually. ,scorpio,Tomorrow’s new moon falls in the most open and outgoing area of your chart, so the next few days should be truly magical. If you get the chance to visit relatives or friends you have not seen in a while don’t hesitate, just go.
scorpio,Wherever you go and whatever you do today you will meet people who inspire you to be bigger and better. You will also, in your own small way, be an inspiration to others, especially those who admire your willingness to take risks. ,scorpio,Travel and social activities will be a lot of fun over the holiday period but the ride won’t always be smooth. If you are visiting friends or relatives in faraway places make sure you plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time.
scorpio,According to your solar chart this is a good day for doing nothing much, so sit back, relax and let life come to you. Your confidence is improving by the minute and the only danger is you might end up with too much self-belief! ,scorpio,A little bit of effort will yield remarkable results over the next few days, so decide what it is you are going to do then do it to the best of your abilities. And don’t be cautious. This is very much a time for trying new things.
scorpio,According to the planets a loved one is getting emotional for no good reason and it is up to you to calm them down and help them see sense again. Everyone should have someone like you to hold their hand and ease their fears. ,scorpio,Keep things simple if you want to have fun. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to travel and social plans. It’s unlikely you are in the mood for too much moving about, so look for your entertainment closer to home.
scorpio,Anyone who thinks they can tell you how to think and what to feel obviously has no idea what sort of person you are but they will find out soon enough – and it could be a rather steep learning curve! No one dictates to a Scorpio.
scorpio,This may be a confusing day on the work front as signals get jumbled and no one seems to know what is really going on. Your best course of action is to ignore what others say you should do and follow your instincts instead. ,scorpio,Your luck is good at the moment and today’s Mercury-Jupiter link will bring good news concerning your work or career. However, as Jupiter is moving retrograde at the moment you are advised not take anything for granted – further changes are coming. ,scorpio,A lot of people will do a lot of silly things today but there is no reason why you should join in the madness. Aim to do the opposite of what everyone else is doing – and the new year will start on the right sort of high.
scorpio,A family problem won’t be so much of an issue as the new year gets underway. Chances are it was never that important anyway but sometimes you build things up to be bigger than they really are. Worry less and enjoy life more. ,scorpio,If you have something to say then say it and don’t worry what others might think. Almost inevitably your words will upset someone but that’s their fault for being so touchy. Likewise, don’t get uptight if someone says things about you. ,scorpio,This is a good time for family matters and if you let loved ones know how much you care and how much you appreciate them it could be one of the best weekends for a very long time – and a great way to start the year. ,scorpio,You will be lucky in love this week – and loved ones will be lucky for you. Travel and social plans may be disrupted slightly because of the full moon but delays will only be minor, so stay calm – you’ll still get there on time.
scorpio,Keep things simple over the next 24 hours, especially if you are on the move. Travel and social plans could easily go wrong, so give yourself plenty of time and have a Route B ready in case Route A is blocked. ,scorpio,Where you are coming from may seem important but it pales into insignificance when measured beside where you are going to. It does not matter what level you are on at this moment, you are very much on the up. So keep climbing. ,scorpio,You are so full of energy at the moment but don’t expect other people to be as active or ambitious as you. Just because you are racing here, there and everywhere does not mean everyone else has to follow your lead. ,scorpio,You need to streamline your working routine and you need to do so now. The first thing you must do is decide how much you can comfortably cope with. The second thing is to simply refuse to take on anything more than that. ,scorpio,If you allow personal feelings to influence the decisions you make today at least one of those decisions will cause you grief. Stick to the facts and avoid wishful thinking. You have a reputation for common sense. Show you deserve it. ,scorpio,No way will you adopt a low profile this weekend. You are full of yourself at the moment and don’t care what sort of an impression you make so long as it’s a big one. By all means show off a bit.
scorpio,Anyone who expects you to compromise over the next few days is going to be disappointed. You are in one of your dynamic moods at the moment and you have no intention of bending even an inch to please other people. ,scorpio,This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you and anything of a creative, artistic or romantic nature is sure to go well over the next few days. You don’t have to ask anyone’s permission to do what makes you feel good. ,scorpio,You may have strong opinions about certain issues but what happens today and tomorrow will force you to question some of your long-held beliefs. Maybe you should move with the times – it doesn’t have to be painful.
scorpio,Nothing is beyond you. All things are possible. That may sound too good to be true but you really can accomplish something remarkable over the next two or three days, simply by following your dream. Turn it into a reality. ,scorpio,You are in one of your assertive moods today and if others have any sense they will give you whatever you demand with no questions asked. Just be careful you don’t annoy someone whose cooperation you may need in the near future. ,scorpio,Your luck will turn for the better very soon but today and over the weekend you must be cautious, especially when traveling and dealing with people whose motives you know little about. Don’t give anything away for free. ,scorpio,The planets signal that some kind of breakthrough is likely but it will come more quickly if you are deliberately assertive. Remember though, that assertive does not mean aggressive. You want to win people over, not turn them against you. ,scorpio,Try to put other people’s needs first as much as possible, because if you do favors for them now they will do you no end of favors over the next few weeks. Focus on getting your home life sorted – everything else follows from that.
scorpio,If you speak your mind today you will get away with it no matter how outrageous your comments may be. If you speak your mind tomorrow or the day after there may be negative consequences. Think before you speak or don’t speak at all. ,scorpio,Put other people’s needs first today and tomorrow, because if you do a favor for partners and loved ones now they will do no end of favors for you over the next few weeks. Focus first on getting your home life sorted. ,scorpio,It may be hard to stay calm and in control of yourself if someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time but chances are they are winding you up on purpose, just to see how you react. Don’t fall for their tricks. ,scorpio,You won’t find it hard to knuckle down and get things done today and tomorrow but try to remember that not everyone is as motivated as you. In a way that’s good because it gives you an excuse to work on your own, which you prefer.
scorpio,You don’t usually lack in the common sense department but today you will do something entirely illogical. Others will be surprised, to say the least, but maybe that’s the idea – maybe you are doing it on purpose!,scorpio,There may be no end of fun things going on socially this weekend but you must put partners and loved ones first, even if it means letting down your buddies. Harmony at home is by far the most important thing at the moment. ,scorpio,Watch what you say, and the way in which you say it, because your words could easily be taken the wrong way. Venus in the most creative area of your chart from Tuesday will improve your mood considerably, which will help. ,scorpio,The planets warn this is not a good time to take chances as cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart is clouding your ability to separate fact from fiction. Why take chances when you have what you need already? ,scorpio,You may want to do things for other people but make sure they want to be helped before you invest your precious time and energy in them. Think more about your own needs today, especially your creative and romantic desires.
scorpio,A money-making idea may seem to be the answer to your prayers but as mind planet Mercury is going through one of its retrograde phases it will pay to be cautious. Is there a potentially large expense you have somehow managed to overlook?,scorpio,It does not matter how many mistakes you have made or how many times you have failed, it matters only that you are still alive and kicking and ready to rejoin the fray. You can never keep a Scorpio down for long. ,scorpio,You have a simple choice today and over the weekend: either you stand by your principles and lose out financially or you reject your ideals and make lots of money. Ask yourself this: how much will it cost you to buy your principles back? ,scorpio,With Mercury still moving retrograde it’s unlikely that everything will go smoothly over the next few days. But don’t make a big deal of delays and disruptions either. You are still moving generally, though slowly, in the right direction. ,scorpio,There will be some strong emotions in the air over the next few days and if you are not very careful you could get swept away by it all. Both in your private life and on the work front you must keep a grip on reality.
scorpio,If someone gets a bit aggressive in their attempts to sell you something you don’t want, be it a physical object or an idea, be a bit aggressive back at them. Sadly, it is the only language they are likely to understand. ,scorpio,You may wonder sometimes if you are in the right line of work but even if you have your doubts this is not the right time to make changes. Let the full moon’s effects subside before you give it some serious thought. ,scorpio,You may not want to do what a friend wants you to do today but if you are smart you will go along with their plans. A few days from now the roles will be reversed and you will be the one in need of support.
scorpio,It may annoy you that some people are so slow on the uptake but not everyone can be a big-brained Scorpio like you. Make allowances today for those who don’t possess your aptitude or ability – that’s just about everyone! ,scorpio,Someone in a position of power will put you to the test today and you must raise your game and show them what you can do. There is little doubt you will win in the end, but can you do it with a smile? ,scorpio,You have been a bit too defensive of late, a bit too reserved. The good news is that with your ruler Pluto linked to Venus over the next 48 hours you can throw off your inhibitions and have the time of your life. Go for it!,scorpio,You may have found it hard to get through to partners and loved ones in recent weeks but that’s okay. Mercury, planet of communication, moves in your favor again on Wednesday, after which you will be on the same wavelength once more. ,scorpio,Your attitude towards something will harden today and you will refuse to make changes or meet others halfway. And that’s good because the planets indicate you will only get where you want to go if you know your own mind. ,scorpio,You will have to seek assistance today from people whose knowledge is superior to your own. You can carry on alone if you like but it won’t be long before you reach a barrier you need help to get over or go around. ,scorpio,You should find it easier now to get along with people who, for one reason or another, have been a bit stand-offish of late. You will also realize that their silence was in no way a reflection on you personally. ,scorpio,Something unusual will occur today but it won’t do you any harm so long as you don’t overreact. It could be the case that someone is deliberately trying to annoy you so that you say or do something stupid – but you’re not stupid, so you won’t! ,scorpio,Information will come your way today that makes you wonder if some of the things you have been led to believe are actually true. It may upset you to discover that you have been misled but, sadly, that’s the real world.
scorpio,Be wary of people who flatter you for no good reason. According to the planets they may be building up your reputation just so they can knock it down again. Be modest in all situations and they won’t get the chance to make you look bad.
scorpio,In a matter of days your confidence will return and the errors of the past, such as they are, will be forgotten. Hopefully, however, you won’t forget the lessons they taught you, especially the one about not taking good luck for granted. ,scorpio,The more you are on the move over the next few days the more likely it is you will learn something to your benefit. Fate may even introduce you to someone who changes your life for the better in ways you had not expected. ,scorpio,You won’t lack for confidence today, nor for the rest of the week, but that is not an invitation to take foolish risks. When dealing with people whose motives you are not entirely sure about make certain what they say and do can’t hurt you.
scorpio,The Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your solar chart today, marking the start of a much more upbeat phase in just about every area. Forget about what went wrong in the past – it’s the future that matters.
scorpio,Even if you strongly disagree with what someone is doing you are advised not to make a big deal of it. It could well be the case that they are acting this way because they want to draw attention to themselves. So ignore them. ,scorpio,Certain chores may be tiresome but there is no way you can get out of them so you might as well resolve to do the best possible job. At least one person will be impressed by your efforts – and reward you in a way that you like.
scorpio,You will work extremely hard this weekend and get twice as much done as your rivals. But are you working for yourself or are you working for someone else? Maybe you need to look at ways you can increase your independence. ,scorpio,It is essential that you start aiming higher, both in your personal life and in your career. You will never forgive yourself if you fail to do something because you fear you won’t be good enough then find later that no one is better. ,scorpio,You need to recognize that you do not have unlimited resources. If there is something you want, and it doesn’t come cheap, you may have to put it on your wait list for a while. There are more important things to spend your money on. ,scorpio,You may be tempted to rush through a task at top speed but if you do you may make a bad job of it. That means you will have to go back and do it again – and get a reputation for slapdash work. Do it right the first time.
scorpio,If you are not feeling on top of the world right at this moment don’t worry about it because it won’t be long before your mood moves rapidly in the other direction. And don’t just tell someone you love them – show them. ,scorpio,Someone will play on your fears and make you think a certain situation is worse than it actually is. According to the planets you should reject everything you hear that makes you feel uneasy. The fact is you have little, if anything, to worry about.
scorpio,Spend as much time as you can with loved ones today because over the weekend they will be extremely busy and you will have things to occupy you as well. It’s not about the quantity of time you spend together but the quality.
scorpio,You will work hard this weekend, as always, but are you working towards a goal that is right for you, or one that benefits other people? It really is time to start putting your own interests first. If not now, then when?,scorpio,You could be a bit too generous for your own good this week. Don’t offer to take on other people’s workloads just because they seem to be struggling. Maybe they are but what good does it do to have you struggle too? ,scorpio,If you need to get back on good terms with a loved one or a relative now is the time to kiss and make up. You don’t have to admit you were wrong – just let them know that your recent disagreement is well and truly forgotten. ,scorpio,If you feel the need to change the way you do things now is the time to be a bit more adventurous and try out new methods and routines. Don’t be surprised to find you have a talent for something you thought was way beyond you.
scorpio,Make an effort to tie up loose ends today because come the weekend there will be new challenges to tackle and the last thing you want is old plans and projects holding you back. Either finish them quickly or forget them completely.
scorpio,Something you have always taken for granted will be held up to the light of the full moon and shown to be less substantial than you imagined. Could what you thought was real be no more than a passing illusion?,scorpio,No one can stop you today. With the Sun energizing your ruler Pluto you are the proverbial irresistible force. However, if you go too far now you may have to pay for it later, so be selective in your aims, and your methods.
scorpio,Do something that makes a difference over the next 48 hours, something you don’t have to do but choose to do because you know it is right. Anyone can do nice things for those they love, but only special people do nice things for strangers.
scorpio,You would no doubt be the first to admit that some of your recent efforts have not been up to your usual high standards but that’s okay. Over the next seven days you will get the chance to shine and this time you won’t let it pass by.
scorpio,According to the planets you have become too set in your ways of late – yes, even more so than usual – and now you must loosen up a little and let other possibilities into your life. Start with your love life. Don’t be so inflexible. ,scorpio,If you focus on a problem to the exclusion of everything else you will find the solution you need. The answers you require are in your mind already and if you slow down and let your inner voice speak it will tell you what you need to hear.
scorpio,Don’t let other people’s criticisms make you feel guilty because the planets indicate you have done nothing wrong. The main reason they are having a go at you is because they envy your abilities and want to undermine your confidence.
scorpio,You will get what you deserve to get today, nothing more and nothing less. Now that you know that you won’t be inclined to complain if what you get falls short of expectations. The good news is you will always get another chance.
scorpio,Mercury moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today, making it easy for you to make changes that you want to make, as opposed to changes that others want you to make. Be your own boss, and be creative too.
scorpio,Cut back on your commitments this weekend. Let others sort things out for themselves for a change. That might sound selfish but according to the planets you are giving too much of yourself and it won’t be long before it’s all gone!,scorpio,You may not be able to see the point in what you are being asked to do but you should do it anyway. According to the planets you have lost sight of the bigger picture but come the solar eclipse on the 20th everything will make sense again. ,scorpio,What looks simple to you may look complicated to someone else, so don’t get uptight if they can’t get their head around it. Patience may not be one of your virtues but you will need plenty of it today. What’s the rush? You’re not on the clock. ,scorpio,Something you have been working on is no longer worth the effort, so let it go. Also, when the Sun moves into the wellbeing area of your chart later this week a change of pace will be necessary. In other words: slow down!,scorpio,The only danger today is that in your desire to prove that you can be original in your thinking you will come up with ideas that simply will not work. Others don’t admire you for your originality – they admire you for your practicality.
scorpio,Make use of the approaching solar eclipse to get a creative project of some kind off to a flying start. If you pour energy and enthusiasm into it now you will build up the kind of momentum that carries you through to the end. ,scorpio,With the Sun moving into the work and wellbeing area of your chart today you will need to do more in some areas but do less in others. Get the balance right and follow periods of intense activity with periods of total rest. ,scorpio,You are in two minds whether or not to take a leadership position in something you have strong feelings about. Yes, it could go wrong and damage your reputation, but the fact is it is too important to be left to lesser mortals. Take control. ,scorpio,Be totally open and honest today. The planets indicate there is no reason why you should want to deceive yourself or other people. Be frank, be fearless and be the one others turn to when they want to know what is really going on. ,scorpio,Everyone seems to know what is best for you. Everyone seems to know what it is you should be doing. And everyone is wrong. Only you know what it is you desire and only you can decide on your next move. Make it a bold one. ,scorpio,With Venus, planet of harmony, moving through your opposite sign at the moment you will have to follow as much as you lead. A partnership begun now will bring advantages for both of you, so put your ego on hold. Try sharing.
scorpio,You will be tempted to make a major decision today, even though you don’t yet know all the facts. Your impatience could pay off or it could land you in deep water – there is no way of knowing which it will be. It’s your choice. ,scorpio,You are in two minds whether to get involved in a feud that is not really any of your business but which you know you could resolve if you can only make people listen. Go on, take a chance – you might just be a hero.
scorpio,You will go out of your way to be nice to people today – even with those who have not always been nice to you in the past. Your kindness will ripple outwards and have a positive effect on friends, friends of friends and even strangers.
scorpio,You may be having second thoughts about something that up until now you have been hugely enthusiastic about but it does not mean you have taken a wrong turning. According to the planets it is just a passing phase – your enthusiasm will return.
scorpio,Try not to say too much this week, especially on the work front. According to the planets a rival is hoping you will open your mouth and put your foot in it so they can have a go at you. Don’t make it easy for them.
scorpio,It won’t be long before you look back at something that is causing you grief and realize how unimportant it was. At the moment, however, you seem to believe it is the most important thing in the world. Get over it and give yourself a break. ,scorpio,You may believe that nothing is beyond you, that you could take on the world and win, but you need to convince other people too. Channel that confidence into something constructive. There is no telling what you might accomplish today. ,scorpio,Partners and work colleagues may seem more dominant now that Mars is moving through your opposite sign, but the only power they have over you is the power that you choose to give them. What will you give them today? Nothing, hopefully.
scorpio,You may wish that you could trade places with someone who seems to be having it easier than you at the moment but if you did you would soon realize that you have made a mistake. Chances are they envy you even more.
scorpio,Go where your passions take you and enjoy them without feeling in the least bit guilty. That little voice inside your head may say it is wrong to be happy when so many are sad but the good thing about little voices is that they are easily ignored.
scorpio,You need to get cracking on all the things you said you would do but somehow never quite got around to starting. Life always gives us a second chance and over the next few days new opportunities will open up for you. Take them.
scorpio,The planets warn you are working too hard and need to change your attitude to your chores, duties and responsibilities. The fact is you will be no good to anyone if you work yourself into the ground. Lighten up – life is supposed to be fun. ,scorpio,You may find it difficult to focus over the next few days – there are too many things going on for you to concentrate on one thing for any length of time. Don’t worry: your mind will be razor sharp again come Friday.
scorpio,What seems unimportant to you may be of earth-shattering significance to someone else, so don’t dismiss their worries out of hand. Scorpio is a Water sign and sensitive by nature, so try showing a bit of empathy over the next 24 hours.
scorpio,You will work extremely hard over the next 24 hours – you will get twice as much done as you usually manage. But are you working for yourself or are you working for other people? Start thinking of ways you can do more for yourself.
scorpio,Someone older and wiser will give you some valuable advice today and if you are smart you will take it. You may be doing well but you could be doing even better, so listen carefully, say thank you and apply the information they give you. ,scorpio,According to the planets someone is as infatuated with you as you are with them but, like you, they fear to be open about it because they can’t handle rejection. Make it easy for them – find subtle ways to let them know your true feelings.
scorpio,Something unsettling is likely to happen over the coming week, most likely when your ruling planet Pluto turns retrograde on Friday. Try not to let it upset you though. In the greater scheme of things it is of relatively minor importance.
scorpio,Your enthusiasm for your work and for life in general will impress important people today. As far as you are concerned a job worth doing is a job worth doing well but if others want to praise you for it you’re not going to complain. ,scorpio,Do you know the meaning of the word compromise? Hopefully you do because the planets warn you won’t get your way by force alone over the next 24 hours. Be willing to negotiate and be ready to give ground as well as take it.
scorpio,Money isn’t everything but it’s still important and what happens today will remind you that you cannot afford to be too relaxed about what you own and earn. You have mouths to feed and bills to pay, so don’t waste your resources.
scorpio,Time spent planning is rarely time wasted, so find room in your busy schedule to look ahead and plan what you are going to be doing when the Sun moves into your opposite sign next week. Make it something you can do with other people.
scorpio,This is a good time to look back over the past few months and see how far you have come and how far you still have to go to reach your number one target. A slight adjustment may be needed to get you back on course.
scorpio,By all means be ambitious this week but don’t let your ambitions take over your life. Personal relationships are every bit as important as professional relationships and one relationship in particular needs some extra care and attention. ,scorpio,Your instincts are telling you that a calculated risk of some kind could pay off in a big way but do you have the courage to go through with it? Only you can make that decision but make it soon or the opportunity will be gone.
scorpio,Quite likely you will say or do something silly today but it’s no big deal. In fact it will most likely endear you to people who previously thought of you as a bit too perfect and a bit too self-controlled. Seems you’re human after all!,scorpio,Put others first today and don’t worry if, in doing so, you fall behind in your schedule. Mercury in your opposite sign means you can easily persuade work colleagues to help you catch up later on. For now, help friends and loved ones.
scorpio,Personal problems of one sort or another seem much bigger than they actually are at the moment and because of that you are advised to wait until the weekend before making important decisions. Most likely things are fine as they are.
scorpio,You may have failed at something but it’s no big deal – at least you made an effort and had a go, which is more than a lot of people manage to do. The planets urge you to put the past behind you. Tomorrow promises to be bright.
scorpio,If your current workload is proving too much for you then you must get help. The planets warn you are doing too much already and must not take on new duties or responsibilities. Get the existing stuff out of the way first. ,scorpio,Someone you are close to emotionally, a family member or a loved one, is going to make some pretty big changes over the next few days. They are more likely to be changes for the good if you encourage them and help them. Don’t be cynical. ,scorpio,You won’t hesitate to speak your mind today but be careful because certain people have got it into their head that you could do with being taken down a peg or two. Be confident but be tactful too – and never be rude.
scorpio,With Mars moving through your opposite sign there are sure to be times when others rub you up the wrong way but you must not get aggressive in return. Give them the cold shoulder. Treat them with that icy disdain you do so well.
scorpio,Do something special over the next 24 hours, something that those who see it never forget. That might not be as easy as it sounds, seeing as you have done so many special things in the past, but you’ll think of something!,scorpio,You may resent having to pay for something that you feel is yours by right but don’t make an issue of it. If you kick up a fuss and manage to change things you may find others deny you in other ways, purely out of spite.
scorpio,Mind planet Mercury moves into one of the more secretive areas of your chart today, so chances are you won’t have much to say for yourself and what you do say will be deliberately misleading. Just watch out you don’t mislead yourself.
scorpio,Be ruthless this weekend. Have the courage of your convictions. The fact that no one else thinks you have got it right is irrelevant – it’s your call to make. If you get it right you will be a hero. If you get it wrong . . . too bad.
scorpio,There will be a lot of tension, both at home and at work, as the new week begins but you must ignore it and focus on your objectives. You cannot stop the changes that are about to take place but you can make changes of your own. ,scorpio,A few weeks from now you will either look back and marvel at the things you accomplished or look back and regret the things you avoided. Which one it is depends entirely on you. Go on, take a chance – you know you want to. ,scorpio,If something no longer works for you the way it once did then get rid of it. That may sound ruthless but this is no time for sentiment, still less for taking risks with your long-term security. Don’t cling to the past.
scorpio,Not even a Scorpio can get their own way all the time and you have no option now but to accept that others are calling the shots. Don’t waste time complaining. If you go along with their plans you might actually enjoy yourself.
scorpio,The most important thing today is that you do something that makes you feel good about yourself. Also, you may need to remove yourself from an environment that reminds you of things, or people, you would prefer to forget.
scorpio,A friend or work colleague will say something you disagree with today but if you are smart you will bite your tongue and pass up the chance to make an issue of it. Something will happen over the weekend that does your talking for you. ,scorpio,If you take too much for granted over the weekend you may end up feeling disappointed when your gains only just manage to outweigh your losses. If you come into money don’t spend any of it until you have paid off what you owe. ,scorpio,You can’t bear it when others keep secrets from you and that could be a problem this week as you seem to be the only one who does not know what is going on. Maybe it’s for the best. Maybe you would not like what you hear. ,scorpio,It’s unlikely that you will be in a sociable mood today but that’s okay because you have important things to think about and you will only do them justice if you cut yourself off from the world and spend some time alone. ,scorpio,It does not matter what you are promised or how much you are offered you must wait a few days before making any new agreements. There is no evidence that someone is trying to trick you, but neither is there any evidence they are not.
scorpio,According to the planets there is something you have overlooked and if you want to avoid making a fool of yourself you need to find out what it is and take appropriate action. No one has noticed your mistake – yet – so get to it.
scorpio,You may not be the most original member of the zodiac but you are certainly the most determined, so keep plugging away and don’t worry that others seem to be doing better than you. The winning post is still a long way off.
scorpio,Try to be a bit more assertive today. Let people in positions of power know that you are not the sort of person they can kick around. You don’t have to be rude or aggressive but you do have to stand up for yourself.
scorpio,Scorpios rarely enjoy drawing attention to themselves and that’s good because the planets warn you need to keep a low profile over the next 48 hours. There may be chaos in all directions but hopefully none of it will affect you. ,scorpio,Before you rush to rescue someone make sure they want to be rescued. In fact, make sure they are genuinely in trouble. You can do good deeds for people without being so dramatic about it. It’s the little things that mean the most. ,scorpio,Today’s new moon will bring into your sphere of contact a person who can make things happen for you. Of course, you are not obliged to accept their offer of assistance but you can sense you would be a fool not to. ,scorpio,Be careful what you ask for over the next 24 hours because, having got it, you may decide that you don’t want it after all. Not only will that be embarrassing but you may have to pay someone to come and take it away again!,scorpio,Partnerships won’t be so intense as from this evening, which is good, but that does not mean you can ignore them altogether. In fact, joint financial ventures are still hugely important, so make sure you know what others are doing with your money!,scorpio,You don’t have to be nice to people just because you think it is expected of you. If you don’t want to associate with certain individuals, for whatever reason, that is your right. If you don’t exercise that right you could lose it.
scorpio,Although Venus is moving through one of the best areas of your chart you still need to be careful, especially when traveling and socializing. You may be confident that you can handle anything that comes your way but don’t tempt fate. ,scorpio,According to the planets this could be one of those weekends when you are tempted to dump your oh-so-careful nature and do something completely irrational. And why shouldn’t you? Even a Scorpio is allowed to be silly once in a while. ,scorpio,Do what you have to do and worry about the consequences later. Better still, don’t worry about the consequences at all. The most successful people in life are those who have a goal and go for it with no distractions. Be one of them.
scorpio,If you get the chance to travel today you should take it, because later in the week your movements are likely to be restricted. You don’t need an excuse to wander around a new neighborhood – you are free to come and go as you please.
scorpio,Someone you have to deal with today and tomorrow may seem scary but they are more afraid of you than you need be of them. You always seem so self-possessed and sure of yourself and it can be quite intimidating! ,scorpio,One minute you want to do one thing and the next minute you want to do something else. That doesn’t sound like you at all: you are usually much more decisive than this. It’s okay – come tomorrow you will be back to your old self.
scorpio,A colleague may tell you that a job has to be done a certain way but if your instincts tell you otherwise then trust yourself and do it your way. What’s the worst that can happen? You get it wrong and they say “I told you so!”,scorpio,You can, if you are prepared to make an effort, accomplish a lot today but the planets indicate you will prefer to take it easy and let things drift over the next 24 hours. There’s no point pushing yourself if you don’t feel like it.
scorpio,Your thoughts may be a bit chaotic this weekend, so try not to make any important decisions, especially those where joint finances are involved. Even if you don’t make a costly mistake, a partner or loved one might.
scorpio,Although the approaching full moon takes place in the money area of your chart there is no evidence to suggest you have anything to be worried about. No one is aiming to cheat you or steal your money, though that won’t stop you being suspicious. ,scorpio,Try not to get yourself in a position today where you have to make a decision about a money or business matter. For best results you should wait until the second half of the week. Even then it might be best to do nothing at all. ,scorpio,Your instincts are nearly always correct but once in a while they let you down and today’s full moon suggests you won’t be thinking straight or feeling straight, so watch out. Above all, don’t take risks with money – you’ll lose out!,scorpio,There are times when it is right to forgive and forget but this isn’t one of them. If you let someone who has damaged you in some way off the hook it will make you look weak and encourage others to take advantage. Get tough. ,scorpio,A falling out of some kind is likely today and it is unlikely to be very pretty. The simple fact is you have had your fill of being pushed around and now certain people need to learn that you can bite as well as bark.
scorpio,The plans you make over the next few days will be important for sure but try not to make them too restrictive. For best results you need to leave yourself some wiggle room so you can make changes as you go along. Be flexible.
scorpio,Try not to spend too much money, especially if your number one reason for doing so is to impress someone whose affections you crave. You are not usually the sort to throw money around, and surely you don’t believe you can buy love? ,scorpio,Are you aiming too high or aiming too low? It’s the latter, of course, and over the next few days you must raise your sights and then raise your game. The planets indicate that if you take a chance it will pay off – big time!,scorpio,The next few days will bring no end of challenges and you will need to be at your best to deal with them effectively. Fortunately, with Jupiter strong in your chart you feel you can take on the world and win. Let’s hope you are right.
scorpio,Put your nose to the grindstone and start making inroads into that pile of tasks you have to get through. For some reason you will be quite enthusiastic about the day-to-day chores you have to take care of – today at least. ,scorpio,Check the small print and scrutinize the details of anything that is put in front of you today, because the planets warn there is something there you won’t agree with. It may not be a deliberate error but it could still be costly.
scorpio,Help will arrive just when you most need it today, so don’t despair, even if the predicament you find yourself in makes it look as if there is no way out. You are being watched over by powers that won’t let you come to harm.
scorpio,You can get a great deal done with very little effort today, not least because others will be falling all over themselves to do you favors. Should you take advantage of their unexpected generosity? Of course you should – and quickly.
scorpio,Your feelings will be intense over the next 48 hours and there is a danger you will go too far and say things and do things that you later regret. The moment you start to calm down is the moment you should start to make your apologies! ,scorpio,Saturn, planet of limitation, moves back into your birth sign tomorrow, bringing with it challenges you have confronted before but never quite got to grips with. Think of it as a second chance. This time you WILL get it right.
scorpio,If there is something important you need to tell a friend or family member then tell them today while there is still a reasonably good chance they will understand. Later in the week you may not find it so easy to express yourself.
scorpio,You may be suspicious of someone’s motives but you must not say anything about it until you know for certain that they are up to no good. If you make accusations you cannot prove you could attract the kind of attention you don’t need.
scorpio,You may find it very difficult to stay in control of your emotions today, but why would you want to? Sometimes it’s good to let everything out, especially if you have been storing up negative feelings. Have a good scream if it makes you feel better!,scorpio,You may not like what you have to do now but the sooner you get it done the sooner you can move on to something more enjoyable. The Sun’s entry into your fellow Water sign of Cancer on Sunday marks a turning point in your fortunes.
scorpio,If you have still to decide on making some sort of commitment you must make up your mind soon. Others are beginning to lose patience with your half-hearted attitude and won’t hesitate to go elsewhere in search of a partner. Is that what you want?,scorpio,Are you open to new ideas? Hopefully you are because the planets suggest that if you try something new over the next few weeks you will be surprised by how much you enjoy it. It does not have to be a threat to what you already believe.
scorpio,Expand your horizons and remind yourself how much more is possible when you believe in yourself. For too long now you have allowed yourself to be influenced by other people’s low expectations. Show the world what you are capable of.
scorpio,The planets indicate that you have been worrying for no good reason – again. Today’s Jupiter-Uranus link will open up a whole new world of personal and professional opportunities, and make you realize that you were wrong to be so distrustful. ,scorpio,You seem to be spending a lot of time looking over your shoulder and wondering who is following you. Chances are no-one is on your case but the trouble with that sort of attitude is it almost invites bad things to happen, Lighten up.
scorpio,You are not usually the type to draw attention to yourself but with Mars moving into one of the more positive areas of your chart today you will find it hard to keep a low profile. Shout about your achievements – they are worth knowing about. ,scorpio,Although you want to be on the move again restrictions of one kind or another are likely to hold you back between now and the weekend. That’s okay – in fact it’s good. If you start your journey too soon you may go in the wrong direction. ,scorpio,Something will grab your attention today and captivate you to such an extent that you have little time and little thought for anything else. In the short-term that may be no bad thing but try not to let it become an obsession. ,scorpio,Someone is mad at you and the only way to be friends again is to admit that you were in the wrong. It might not do much for your ego but this is a partnership that you need to keep alive, for professional as well as personal reasons.
scorpio,Be smart and keep your thoughts to yourself this week, however much you might be tempted to argue with someone whose opinions you disagree with. There is a danger you will get carried away and say things that you one day regret. No change there then!,scorpio,There will be more than one occasion over the next few days when you are tempted to believe you are heading in completely the wrong direction. Don’t do anything drastic though as it could just be the moon playing tricks on your mind.
scorpio,Mars, planet of action, endows you with a taste for adventure but you would be wise to take care when traveling or engaging in potentially dangerous activities over the next few days. Discussing politics and religion is best avoided too!,scorpio,Go out of your way to be nice to people over the next 24 hours, even people you seriously don’t like. The planets indicate that if you show the pleasant side of your nature (yes, you do have one!) others will respond in kind.
scorpio,With communications planet Mercury so strong at the moment you will find it ridiculously easy to get friends and relatives to see things your way. Of course, if your way turns out to be the wrong way they won’t be too happy! ,scorpio,Not long after mind planet Mercury moves in your favor on Wednesday your confidence will come flooding back. If you have an urge to travel then you could be on the move sooner than you expected. Your journey will be memorable.
scorpio,Sudden changes may not be entirely welcome but neither are they to be feared, so accept them and work with them. Nothing lasts forever, nor should you want it to, so go with the flow and enjoy where fate takes you.
scorpio,You will soon get the chance to move up in the world but first you need to convince yourself that you are worthy of success. Yes, you are up to the task. Believe in yourself and the world will believe in you too. ,scorpio,You will speak from the heart today but, of course, not everyone will want to hear what you say. Some people find the truth uncomfortable and one person in particular will kick up a fuss and refuse to take heed. It’s their loss.
scorpio,You want to impress people who can help you realize your ambitions, but there is a danger you’ll go too far and say things and do things that are so over the top that they end up being counter-productive. Don’t try so hard.
scorpio,If a friend or work colleague proposes that you do something different over the next few days don’t dismiss the idea out of hand. You may be a creature of habit but sometimes it is good to go off at a tangent. Such a time is now.
scorpio,Beliefs and opinions you usually take for granted won’t seem quite so solid over the next few days and you will start to see the world in new ways. If you are going to change your philosophy of life now is as good a time as any.
scorpio,Just because you disagree with someone does not mean you cannot work alongside them and if you keep that fact in mind you won’t go far wrong. More importantly, you are less likely to fall out with someone whose friendship is a benefit.
scorpio,Somehow you will know in an instant what the people you deal with, both at home and at work, are thinking and feeling. That makes it easier for you to predict what they are going to do next, maybe  even before they know it themselves.
scorpio,Approach the day in a positive frame of mind and you will accomplish a lot. Approach the day in a negative frame of mind and you will accomplish the same things but you won’t get much joy from them. It’s a simple choice really.
scorpio,Yes, you are in the right. Yes, the facts are all on your side. But that does not matter. The only thing that counts today is who has the most power and, sadly, it isn’t you. Don’t pick fights you cannot possibly win. ,scorpio,Don’t worry about minor matters today because it is the big picture you should be looking at now. Take an overview of what is happening, both in your personal affairs and in the world at large. What you see will surely delight you.
scorpio,The planets warn that certain people will try to bully you into abandoning ideas and opinions that mean a lot to you – and you must fight them every inch of the way. It’s not about right or wrong – there is a principle at stake. ,scorpio,Too many times in recent weeks you have been half-hearted about what you have been working on and some people may be of the opinion that they would be better off without you. It’s time to get your act in gear and prove them wrong.
scorpio,This is no time to be cautious. With the Sun moving into the career area of your chart this week you must lay your reputation on the line. Don’t sit back waiting for opportunities to come to you – get out there and make things happen.
scorpio,As the Sun approaches the career area of your chart over the next few days start thinking of ways you can impress people in positions of power. Tell them you are willing to shoulder more responsibility – assuming that’s what you want, of course. ,scorpio,Let your thoughts roam free today. If there are no limits to what you can imagine there will be no limits to what you can achieve, creatively or romantically. What is possible? Anything at all you want to be possible. ,scorpio,With both the Sun and Mercury about to move into the career area of your chart you will no longer have any doubts about what it is you should be doing. Think strategically but be flexible too. The more you adapt the more you succeed.
scorpio,You may say that you don’t care for status and recognition and you may even mean it but with the Sun and Mercury moving into the career area of your chart today it will be thrust upon you. You make a better leader than most. ,scorpio,Try not to make too much of a fuss about something that is really quite trivial. If a friend or work colleague makes a mess of something try showing sympathy rather than anger. It’s not what they do wrong but what you do right that matters. ,scorpio,Try not to make too much of a fuss about something that is really quite trivial. If a friend or work colleague makes a mess of something try showing sympathy rather than anger. It’s not what they do wrong but what you do right that matters. ,scorpio,If you find yourself in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable over the next few days just get up and leave. It may seem rude to others but better to be rude than to feel so out of place that you never want to go back. ,scorpio,The planets suggest that if you trust your instincts and follow your hunches you can achieve great things over the next few days. Creative activities are especially well starred, so if you possess a talent of some kind don’t be afraid to use it.
scorpio,You need to find the courage to make the kind of difficult decision that on other occasions you would strive to avoid. Keep reminding yourself that change is not something that should be avoided but something that should be welcomed.
scorpio,The most important thing over the next 24 hours is that you stay calm and think things through in a logical manner. Also, as some people are liable to be touchy in the extreme it may not be the best time to speak from the heart. ,scorpio,You are never afraid to be controversial but today there is a danger that you will go too far and make an enemy of someone who is extremely powerful. Your bravery is to be commended, but ask yourself: is it worth the hassle?,scorpio,Your thoughts have been a little scary of late but don’t worry, you are not losing your mind. You are though beginning to explore areas you never even noticed before. What scares you now will soon be a natural and accepted part of your life.
scorpio,Do whatever it takes to get along with the people you work and do business with. That does not mean you must sell yourself short or sell your soul, but at the very least you need to treat them as equals – even if they’re not. ,scorpio,You might like to change the world but why not change yourself instead? If you act only from the highest of principles you will both feel better about yourself and be a good example for others to follow – that’s how you change things.
scorpio,No one can get the better of you now, you are just too sharp. On the work front, especially, your star is on the rise and people in positions of authority are watching you closely. The tougher the challenge the more you will like it.
scorpio,Your mind may be full of big ideas but are they good ideas? According to the planets you will accomplish more if you focus on one thing at a time and put the rest out of your mind. Concentration is the key to lasting success.
scorpio,Even a Scorpio needs encouragement now and again and the good news is that friends and loved ones will go out of their way to reassure you today. It’s nice to know you are appreciated by the people in your life who matter.
scorpio,You may be the kind of person who never goes back on a decision but you will have to make an exception to that rule today. Once the consequences of a decision come into focus you will quickly realize you got it completely wrong.
scorpio,If you need to make an impression on employers and other important people then now is the time to do it. Aim to do something dramatic, something that gets you noticed, something that cannot be ignored. Just make sure it is moral and legal! ,scorpio,What happens around the middle part of the week will force you to face up to a situation that most likely you have been avoiding. Remember, you are not the first one to have gone down this road. Get advice if you need it. ,scorpio,If you force yourself to be enthusiastic about something you don’t much like today you may surprise yourself by how easy it is – and how much you enjoy it. Like so many things, whether or not it is fun depends entirely on you.
scorpio,You have come through difficult times relatively unscathed and, more importantly, with your head held high, but don’t get carried away because there are more challenges to come. The difference is you are now looking forward to them.
scorpio,You rarely, if ever, change your opinions once your mind is made up but over the next few days you will find yourself questioning some of the things you have come to believe. Could it be you were deceived? Maybe it was self-deception? ,scorpio,It will annoy you when a friend or work colleague gets something wrong because they have not done their homework but there is no point getting angry about it. Let them know in subtle ways that they have let themselves down.
scorpio,A new moon in the career area of your chart will make you even more ambitious than you have been of late. However, before you make any major moves you would be wise to check facts and figures thoroughly. Not everyone can be trusted.
scorpio,Make life easier for yourself by refusing to attach too much importance to what you see and hear. According to the planets certain people will do things and say things just to get a reaction but if you refuse to react they will soon lose interest.
scorpio,Important news will come your way but whether it is good news or bad news remains to be seen. A lot will depend on how you choose to interpret it. Try not to look at it as a chore. Approach it as if it is the best news in the world.
scorpio,If your private life is in a bit of a mess then now is the time to sort it out. The planets will help you make necessary changes but you have got to be honest with those you love. Don’t just tell them what they want to hear.
scorpio,What happens today will force you to think deeply about things you have taken for granted up until now. It will also force you to realize that you don’t live in a vacuum – what you do in your life touches the lives of those around you as well.
scorpio,Something surprising will happen over the next 24 hours, and although you don’t usually like to be taken unawares this is one occasion when you won’t mind a bit. Any doubts you may have about a loved one’s commitment will disappear for good.
scorpio,There is no point trying to run away from your problems because they will only chase after you. The more constructive part of your nature knows it must face them head on. Life may be tough at the moment but you can be tough too. ,scorpio,You should be making plans that stretch well into the future – not weeks and months but years and decades. You need a vision, something to aim for, something to inspire you. The details can be sorted out later, it’s the big picture that matters now.
scorpio,No matter how bad you think certain things may be the planets suggest that they will start to get easier as from today. Also, try to get rid of the idea that everyone is out to cheat you – it’s not true. Most people want to see you do well.
scorpio,Sometimes you can be too cautious for your own good but now it seems you cannot be cautious enough. The coming week’s influences will in some way or other disrupt your daily routine, so breathe deeply, stay calm and don’t start anything new.
scorpio,Never doubt that you are heading in the right direction or that you will succeed in the end. There may be times when you find it hard to keep your doubts at bay but keep them at bay you must. You have sacrificed too much to give up now. ,scorpio,What you have to say over the next 24 hours will not be what certain people want to hear, so don’t be surprised if they try to twist your words. The message you have to deliver is of major importance, so keep repeating it.
scorpio,Your generosity will make you many friends today but it could also get you into trouble, especially if you are too trusting of people you don’t know that well. What happened to that overly suspicious Scorpio we all know and love? ,scorpio,The closer you get to the weekend the more something seems to be worrying you, but there is no need to torment yourself. Instead of focusing on what might (but probably won’t) go wrong, find ways to make life more enjoyable and rewarding. ,scorpio,Friends may beg you to get involved in something they promise will be a lot of fun but your sixth sense tells you there is more to it than that, and your sixth sense is rarely wrong. Do only what you feel comfortable with.
scorpio,Because you like to be in control there will be times over the next 48 hours when you feel ill at ease. What you have to remember is that things change whether you like it or not – not even a Scorpio can hold back the tides of fate.
scorpio,Something unexpected will happen today, something that throws your plans into confusion. It may be annoying but don’t get upset because the planets indicate there is a silver lining. Maybe what you were planning was not such a good idea.
scorpio,You will go out of your way to take some kind of risk as the new week begins. However, with Venus moving retrograde through the career area of your chart be careful you don’t do something that upsets people in positions of power. ,scorpio,There is a danger now that you will lose sight of reality and maybe get a bit emotional about things that do not matter. What you are worrying about is most likely an illusion, so snap out of it and get back in touch with reality.
scorpio,There are a lot of strange things going on around you at the moment. Should you be worried? No you should not. The planets indicate that whatever may be going on it is not directed at you personally. You may in fact benefit in the long-term.
scorpio,Stay true to what you believe in, even if it brings you into conflict with people in authority. Just because someone has their hands on the levers of power does not mean they are right. Acknowledge your instincts and act on your principles.
scorpio,Make an effort to be friendly with everyone you meet over the next 24 hours. Yes, of course, some people will be less than friendly in return but it’s about how you choose to behave, not how a minority of idiots choose to react.
scorpio,There is nothing you cannot do and no one you cannot persuade to see things your way. Whether your way is the best way is, of course, another matter entirely but the power of your words will overcome any doubts others may have.
scorpio,You will go all out to influence employers and other important people over the next few days and you will succeed more than you imagined was possible. Your charm and way with words will persuade them to open doors for you. ,scorpio,It’s good to have high expectations of yourself but don’t try to impose your hopes and wishes on other people. Partners and colleagues won’t take kindly to you interfering in their affairs, not even if it is done for the best possible motives. ,scorpio,Today’s Mars-Uranus link will bring you face-to-face with the kind of situation you usually go out of your way to avoid but if you confront it with courage and refuse to back down you will come through unscathed. To some you may even be a hero. ,scorpio,You are rather restless at the moment, especially on the mental level where your thoughts are jumping all over the place. But that’s good. The more you allow your mind to wander the more ideas and insights you will come up with. ,scorpio,Any sudden and unexpected changes that take place around the time of Sunday’s eclipse are sure to work in your favor. If you want to make a lifestyle change don’t hang around and don’t wait for approval. The only permission you need is your own.
scorpio,You may be a loner by nature but you must make an effort to get along with colleagues and acquaintances over the next few days. It may not always be possible to like certain people but that does not mean you cannot work with them.
scorpio,Group activities of all kinds are well starred at the moment, so make the effort to work with friends and colleagues and people you interact with socially and together you will create something amazing. Aim to make a difference, not just be different.
scorpio,You will get along well with everyone this week, even those you have fallen out with in the past. Both at home and at work others will go out of their way to be nice to you and for once you won’t be suspicious of their motives.
scorpio,Think positively about what you are required to do by people in positions of authority. It may not be what you want to do but the bottom line is they have the power and you do not. Don’t start a battle you cannot possibly win.
scorpio,You may be unaware that someone is annoyed with you but you’ll find out soon enough. If a loved one or work colleague gives you a hard time over the next 24 hours try to find out why. Was it something you said or did? ,scorpio,Are you delighted with what you have achieved? Or are you saddened because you wasted so many opportunities? Either way you should not get too worked up about it. You will always get another chance – and another, and another after that.
scorpio,Something that made perfect sense a short while ago now seems to make no sense at all and it’s immensely frustrating. Don’t worry about it. A day or two from now you will have forgotten why you thought it was so important.
scorpio,You need to be open and honest about your desires. Being a secretive Scorpio it won’t come easy to you but unless you let others know how you feel they won’t be able to respond the way you want them to respond. At least drop a few hints.
scorpio,You won’t find it easy to express yourself over the next 24 hours, but that’s okay – you’re not exactly renowned for your conversation. Keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself and only speak when what you have to say is of real importance.
scorpio,You won’t be in a forgiving mood today but if you are wise you will bite your tongue and not say anything hurtful, no matter how much certain people may deserve it. Give them that Scorpio “look” instead – they’ll get the message.
scorpio,Positive thoughts bring positive results, but the opposite is true as well: if you start thinking you do not deserve all the good things that are coming your way you will find they stop coming very quickly. Keep dreaming and keep believing.
scorpio,You may be a bit more cautious than usual but that’s okay. A lot, of course, depends on how much faith you have in your own abilities. Always believe there is a higher power guiding your actions and protecting you from harm. ,scorpio,Partners and loved ones will want you to join in with their plans today and you would be wise to make the effort. The more you do for others now the more they will do for you later and it won’t be long before you are calling in favors.
scorpio,It’s not often that you get up in front of other people and lay down the law but you will do so today. It annoys you to think that the answer to a major problem is obvious to you but no one else seems able to see it.
scorpio,You need to get your priorities right. Both at home and at work you will have to deal with changes that have been building up for some time, and you will deal with them better if you know in your mind what matters and what does not.
scorpio,Certain people will go out of their way to talk you down and make you feel small but the planets suggest that your position has not changed that much, if at all, so don’t overreact. You are as popular as you ever were with the people who count.
scorpio,Disputes of one kind or another are likely over the next few days and almost inevitably you will clash with someone in a position of authority. But that’s okay. The more you fight for your rights now the less likely it is you will be cheated later.
scorpio,Let partners and colleagues know that you are willing to be part of the team – chances are they have had their doubts of late. Too often you have been half-hearted about joint projects. Now go right the other way and be frighteningly enthusiastic.
scorpio,The Sun in Libra may make you a bit depressed, but console yourself with the thought that there are billions of people out there who would happily change places with you. Stop feeling sorry for yourself — you’re one of the lucky ones. ,scorpio,You won’t lack for compassion today but you may lack for common sense, so be careful. Don’t let others fool you into thinking that you are doing the right thing, when in fact the real right thing is to leave well alone.
scorpio,The reason you find it so hard to make up your mind what to do next is because you are worrying about things that will probably never happen. Fortunately, your worries will fade over the weekend. Today, try not to think so much. ,scorpio,Deep down you know that what you are going through is necessary to your long-term interests, but it’s still tough. The good news is there won’t be so many setbacks and misfortunes over the next 24 hours. Compared to some people you’re doing well.
scorpio,Do you change with the times or do you try to make the times change for you? Silly question, right? You of all people should know that certain forces cannot be defeated, they can only be used, so go with the flow and be happy.
scorpio,Your feelings will be magnified to such an extent during the early part of the week that you may not be able to control yourself and that could cause trouble, especially at home. Don’t let family squabbles get out of hand.
scorpio,Somehow you will know in an instant what the people you deal with are thinking and feeling – and you can and you must make use of that ability. You will be able to predict what others are going to do before they know it themselves. ,scorpio,Your emotions are quite raw at the moment and it may at times seem as if every little thing is a matter of life or death. But it isn’t and a few days from now you will get a new and more positive perspective on life. ,scorpio,It may seem as if almost everyone you meet is in some way critical of what you are doing but that’s an exaggeration. In fact, the only people who are asking questions are the ones who care for you the most. Try listening to what they say. ,scorpio,Don’t cover up for a friend if they have done something wrong because it will reflect badly on you in the long-term. They should be big enough to stand up and admit they made a mistake and if they’re not then why are you friends with them? ,scorpio,The Sun in Libra at this time of year undermines your confidence a bit but that does not mean you are allowed to feel sorry for yourself. Life should be easier now that mind planet Mercury is helping you to think straight again.
scorpio,The planets suggest that if you are bold over the coming week you will make some kind of breakthrough, even though the forces ranged against you are strong. Have faith in your abilities and take that big leap into the unknown. ,scorpio,This is the ideal time to face up to aspects of your personality that you usually do your best to ignore. Everyone has negative qualities but not everyone tries to channel their negative qualities in a positive direction. But you’re not everyone – you’re special.
scorpio,Don’t take it to heart if certain people seem to be avoiding you. It does not mean they no longer like you. On the contrary, the most likely reason they are keeping their distance is because they don’t want to burden you with their woes. ,scorpio,You don’t have to be on top of things every minute of every day. Yours is a sign that values hard work and leads from the front but the planets indicate you will achieve twice as much as you usually do with only half the effort. ,scorpio,You seem to know everyone’s little secrets. You also seem to know who is telling you the truth and who is lying. It’s an amazing talent and one you could and should do more with. Maybe you should become a detective?,scorpio,Because you have been so busy of late the people you are closest too are feeling a bit neglected. Make it your business today to remind them that they mean more to you than anything else in the world. But don’t give up on the hard work.
scorpio,Agree with everything others say this weekend, even if you don’t believe a word of it. You would, of course, prefer to be honest but the planets warn this is not the time to make waves. Don’t make enemies of people who should be friends. ,scorpio,Your prospects will improve dramatically from the 23rd when the Sun moves into your sign, so keep thinking positive thoughts and keep telling yourself that no matter how bad it has been it will soon be better than you can possibly imagine. ,scorpio,No matter how difficult recent weeks may have been what happens today and tomorrow will surely convince you that a corner has been turned and the good times will soon be back. You are definitely one of life’s lucky ones now.
scorpio,Try not to take yourself too seriously today, especially if certain people flatter you no end. Most likely they are after something and hope that by saying the right things you will give it to them. But you’re not that gullible, are you?,scorpio,You may have enviable self-belief but the danger now is that you will convince yourself, wrongly, that you can master something that is simply beyond you. You don’t have to be good at everything. Even a Scorpio is allowed a weakness or two. ,scorpio,The Sun’s move into your birth sign tomorrow marks the start of a new solar year, so by all means go out and celebrate. An evening spent with friends and family will put you in the right frame of mind to do something special over the weekend. ,scorpio,The Sun moves into your sign today, marking the start of a new solar year. You may not notice much change to begin with but by the early part of next week a lot of new opportunities will be heading your way. Accept and embrace them. ,scorpio,It’s not often you get caught by surprise but something will shock you this weekend. That’s what you get for taking too much for granted. Financially, you may have to tighten your belt over the next few days but it’s no big deal. ,scorpio,Because there is a full moon in your opposite sign of Taurus this week you should take what people tell you with a large pinch of salt. Good advice will be hard to come by, but bad advice will come at you from all directions! ,scorpio,You are rarely afraid to be controversial but watch out you don’t go too far today or tomorrow and make an enemy of someone who is more than a match for you. The approaching full moon warns you must be careful what you say. ,scorpio,The Sun in your sign at this time of year gives you heaps of confidence but because there is also a full moon today you will need more than a large dose of self-belief. The most important question is: have you learned from past mistakes? ,scorpio,You may be right to be angry with someone who has let you down but don’t make a big issue of it. Let them know you are not amused, then let it go. Whatever it is you have lost you will soon find something better to replace it. ,scorpio,Even if you are feeling a bit run down after recent efforts the Sun in your sign will revive you and give you your second wind and come the weekend you will be back to your best. Be careful with money though. Spend less and save more.
scorpio,You may be willing to make sacrifices above and beyond the call of duty but you can’t do it all on your own. There are lots of people who think like you and share your vision – join forces with them today and over the weekend.
scorpio,You will have a lot to say for yourself over the next 48 hours, and even more to say when communications planet Mercury moves into your sign on Monday. Yes, it’s quite possible that you will make enemies. Are you bothered? Of course not!,scorpio,You can easily persuade others to give you their support today, simply by using your charm. Remember, people will always respond to you better if you make them believe that by helping you they will also in some way be helping themselves. ,scorpio,It is quite likely that your self-control will crack today and you will say something or do something drastic. Don’t hate yourself for losing your cool. Scorpios have feelings too and every so often they should be allowed to run free.
scorpio,You may have to give up on something that is never going to work out but there is no need to feel bad about it. New opportunities will present themselves over the next few weeks and all you have to do is recognize them and use them.
scorpio,Be wary of people who go out of their way to appeal to your emotions. The planets warn you could lose out in a big way if you let others persuade you to believe in what your head tells you is rubbish. Don’t be gullible.
scorpio,Something is worrying you and you won’t get over it by trying to put it out of your mind. The only way to deal with your fear is to face it and not be afraid of what you might find. Chances are there is nothing there.
scorpio,You know what needs to be done and, yes, it’s a huge challenge, but you can manage it. This is one of those days when, if you push yourself beyond your usual limits you will find your second wind and overcome challenges with ease. ,scorpio,For quite some time you have found it hard to trust a certain person but over the next few days you won’t be quite so suspicious, and that’s a good thing. The two of you were firm friends once and can be again. ,scorpio,You can persuade almost anyone to do almost anything for you now and, yes, you should most definitely take advantage of the situation. But use your powers of persuasion to help those in need, not merely to enrich yourself in various ways. ,scorpio,Something you thought you could cope with will get completely out of control over the next 24 hours. This is no time to worry that you might look weak – get help from people who know what they are doing. Clearly, you do not! ,scorpio,Someone who tries to convince you that you owe them in some way is not to be trusted – they are obviously after something at your expense. Just because you feel so good about life does not mean you have to give what you own away.
scorpio,You are determined to make the most of the opportunities now coming your way and with today’s new moon on your side what you begin over the next 24 hours is sure to be a huge success. Aim for the stars, then go even higher. ,scorpio,If you need assistance, ask for it. If you pretend that nothing is wrong others will assume that you are on top of things and will stay out of your way. Even a Scorpio needs a helping hand once in a while and today you may need several.
scorpio,You are more sensitive than people imagine and what happens today will affect you deeply. Put on a brave face and make it appear as if you are in full control but open up to someone you trust as well. It always helps to talk. ,scorpio,You may have to change your plans at the last moment and, of course, you won’t be happy about it. The fact is though there is not a lot you can do about it, so take it in your stride and don’t let your anger show.
scorpio,Try not to attach too much importance to what your five senses tell you over the next few days because there is a good chance they will lead you astray. This is one of those strange times when your own eyes and ears cannot be entirely trusted.
scorpio,Sometimes the best way to help other people is to leave well alone and that is very much the message of the stars at the moment. Chances are you won’t be thinking straight over the next few days, so keep your distance as much as you can. ,scorpio,If someone needs a helping hand then give it to them with no thought of reward. With the Sun in your sign chances are you don’t want for anything but not everyone is as fortunate as you, so spread a little joy around over the next few days. ,scorpio,It may be in your power to take what you desire but the planets warn it is not in your long-term interests to do so. If there is something you want but cannot attain through fair means, it may be a sign that you are not supposed to have it.
scorpio,Try not to get too emotional about something that you would usually dismiss as not worth the effort. Also, don’t be afraid to cut your losses if they are getting too big: the longer you hang on the bigger they are likely to get. ,scorpio,Do something dramatic before the Sun moves out of your birth sign on Sunday. Any doubts you may have about what you are doing must be swept away. If it feels right to you then it does not matter what the rest of the world thinks about it.
scorpio,The Sun’s entry into the money area of your chart tomorrow places the emphasis on what you own and earn. In recent weeks you have been so caught up in enjoying the good things in life that you may have lost track of how much you have spent.
scorpio,Your view of reality seems to be a bit distorted at the moment and that could cause problems if you let the line between fact and fantasy get blurred. Be extra careful where money matters are concerned because if you get it wrong it could cost you.
scorpio,Speak up now or forever hold your peace. If you have something to say – or, more likely, something to complain about – you must get it off of your chest immediately because no one will have the time to listen later in the week.
scorpio,If what you get today seems more than you think you deserve there must be a cosmic reason for it. Could it be you did a favor for someone earlier in the year and, being the modest person you are, forgot about it? The universe never forgets. ,scorpio,You need to take a fresh approach to a money matter that has been causing you problems. The truth is you have allowed yourself to be influenced by what friends and family think you should do, so ignore their advice and follow your instincts. ,scorpio,The most important thing today is that you know what you want and you know where to find it. If you do then there is a very good chance that you can make it your own. Above all Scorpio, don’t listen to those who urge caution.
scorpio,If you do not feel comfortable with a particular group of people then get up and leave. There is no law that says you have to put your own needs on hold just to make others feel good. On the contrary, your first duty is always to yourself. ,scorpio,You will have a lot to say for yourself this weekend and while most of it will be positive some of it may upset those who don’t take kindly to criticism. Be that as it may you must not be intimidated. Always call it as you see it. ,scorpio,Take each day as it comes and be ready to go wherever fate points you. Good fortune will come not only from your own efforts but also from the patronage of powerful friends. Who you know is more important than what you know.
scorpio,Identify what is important to you and focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. You have wasted a lot of time on things that cannot take you closer to your goals. If you know what you want you will find a way to get it. ,scorpio,You have so much going for you and so many opportunities to choose from. Money matters are central at the moment, so look for ways to increase your cashflow. Creative activities of all kinds will be especially rewarding, both financially and personally. ,scorpio,Others can cut corners if they wish but you must continue to play by the rules. Don’t worry if your rivals pull ahead of you over the next 24 hours because their underhand methods will come back to haunt them in the fullness of time. ,scorpio,You need to decide once and for all what it is you want most out of life and to focus all your energies in that single direction. Forget about what might have been because it is what still can be that matters. You can still be a star. ,scorpio,You may feel out of your depth and you may be tempted to give up on what you only recently started but if you do you will regret it in a matter of days. Hang in there and do whatever it takes to keep your confidence up.
scorpio,As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign this weekend you won’t want to push yourself too hard. Do only what makes you feel good about yourself and ignore those who say you are letting your life go to waste. What do they know about it?,scorpio,You have a right to believe what you want to believe even if the whole wide world disagrees with you. Don’t let anyone dictate to you over the coming week, what is or is not permissible to think, say or do. That’s for you to decide. ,scorpio,Don’t let anything stop you going out and having a good time today. Some people may say that you are being irresponsible but it isn’t true – and the more you let your hair down now the more work you will get done later on.
scorpio,If you catch yourself wondering what might have been that is a sure sign you are unhappy with your lot and need to make changes. But don’t change anything yet. Give it a few days and it may surprise you how easy it is to transform your life. ,scorpio,Relationships of all kinds will go well over the next 24 hours. It helps that there is something of the celebrity about you at the moment – heads turn in your direction wherever you go. Where did your star quality come from? Who knows, but don’t waste it. ,scorpio,According to the planets you have overlooked a small but important detail and the effects of that oversight will become apparent over the next 24 hours. Under no circumstances try to blame others for your failure. Be big enough to own your mistakes. ,scorpio,If you get an offer that could bring you more money you should take it. Yes, it will mean more work and, yes, you will have to sacrifice other things but if you turn it down you will kick yourself later when you realize what might have been.
scorpio,You will be a good deal less intense this weekend than you have been of late. Venus in your sign will helps you see things in their true light and the result is that the world will look a sunnier, happier place. It’s all about perspective.
scorpio,Hopefully the recent new moon will have changed your thinking in some way, especially if you are the kind of Scorpio who is sometimes a bit too stubborn for their own good. Money-making ideas won’t be hard to come by but can you apply them? ,scorpio,Try not to appear too eager today. If you can give others, and especially your rivals, the impression that you don’t care whether you win or you lose you will lull them into a false sense of security. In fact, no one wants to win more than you!,scorpio,You need to take your cashflow situation more seriously than you have been doing these past few weeks. If your resources are low then there are only two ways you are going to build them up again: spend less or earn more. Better still, do both. ,scorpio,To begin with you won’t much enjoy being put under pressure today but after a while you will realize that the experience is not so bad after all. Deep down you know you need to make changes to your working routine and this will merely confirm it. ,scorpio,Wherever you go and whatever you do you can’t seem to shake off the feeling that something bad is going to happen. Most likely it is all in your mind but steer clear of places and situations where you are not fully in control. Just in case. ,scorpio,Stand up for your rights today and don’t let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do. What others don’t seem to understand is that you cannot be bribed or pressured to go against your principles. Flattery, of course, is harder to defend against.
scorpio,An anxiety of some sort has been gnawing away at you and you need to deal with it. You should know by now that if you face up to what you fear it often turns out to be nothing at all, so be brave and be bold – and act! ,scorpio,As the Sun joins Mercury, planet of communication, in one of the more outgoing areas of your chart this week, you won’t be lost for words. But take care you don’t go too far and say things that might hurt those of a sensitive disposition.
scorpio,It may be tiresome having to spell out in plain language what should be a simple set of facts but it’s the only way you can be sure certain people will get it right. Take the time and make the effort – ultimately it’s for your own benefit. ,scorpio,You will have no difficulty letting others know what you think and feel today. However, that does not mean you should tell them everything about yourself. Not only could that be embarrassing but it could also give your rivals information to use against you.
scorpio,Do what makes you happy today, not what makes other people happy. If that makes you unpopular in certain circles, so be it – it’s their loss, not yours. Talking of loss, you could find yourself better off financially without them as well.
scorpio,There is no point trying to keep your feelings to yourself over the next two or three days because you won’t be able to. Be open about the way that you feel. If you bottle up your emotions now they could explode spectacularly later on.
scorpio,You have never been one to follow the herd and the more others urge you to agree with them the more you must resist the pressure to conform. Actually you quite enjoy being at odds with everyone else, so it won’t be much of a hardship.
scorpio,Something will happen this weekend that causes you to revise some of your most deeply held convictions. As a Scorpio it takes a lot for you to admit that you are wrong but the evidence will be so overwhelming that you simply have no choice. ,scorpio,When Venus changes signs on Wednesday some sort of material gain is likely but don’t take your good fortune for granted. Remember too that you always get more from what you own and earn if you don’t grasp it too tightly.
scorpio,You will go out of your way to help people in need over the next few days. Are you trying to make up for things you should have done earlier in the year? Maybe, maybe not, but it doesn’t matter. Good works are valuable no matter the motivation.
scorpio,It might be wise to keep your opinions to yourself over the next 24 hours. The planets warn that if you say anything that others consider to be over the top or in poor taste it could cost you dear. Not everyone shares your offbeat sense of humor. ,scorpio,You believe that anything is possible, and no doubt it is, but you would still be wise not to take anything for granted, especially where there may be money at stake. You could gain a lot today, but you could lose a lot too. ,scorpio,Someone you have financial dealings with may try to sell you short but they will only succeed if you let them. It may be new year’s eve and a time to have fun but keep your guard up when it comes to serious matters like money. ,scorpio,Even if you rarely stray far from your usual environment you will be eager to get out and about as the new year begins. If a friend suggests that you go off and do something different together you will happily agree – but why not suggest it first?,scorpio,Everything you do in the early days of the new year must be done for practical reasons. Don’t waste time and energy on activities that do not bring results. Others may find you a bit too serious but there will be a time for fun and games later on. ,scorpio,You have started many things in recent weeks and the rewards will start coming your way over the next few days. Life will be even more enjoyable if you spread your good fortune around. Share the spoils with those who have shared in your efforts.
scorpio,Something will occur today that angers you a bit but don’t let your feelings get out of control. And before you make any kind of accusations make sure that the facts are correct. Maybe it’s you who has got the wrong end of the stick. ,scorpio,No one is immune to your charms. You know exactly what words to use to win others over and you know that even if they resist it is only a matter of time before they give in and give you what it is you desire. You’re an unstoppable force.
scorpio,This promises to be an excellent day socially, so don’t just sit there, get out and about and make new friends and enjoy new experiences. Someone you meet on your travels will say something that opens your mind to possibilities you never dreamed of. ,scorpio,Forces over which you have no control will upset your plans today but the long-term forecast is still good. You may even be pleased that you were compelled to change direction. In the greater scheme of things everything happens for a reason. ,scorpio,If you must take a risk today then try to make it one where, if you lose, it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. Jupiter, planet of excess, is beginning one of its retrograde phases, so Lady Luck is unlikely to be on your side.
scorpio,Times may have been tough financially of late but what happens today and tomorrow will hopefully convince you that the worst is over. The only danger, of course, is that you will celebrate by going on a spree and land yourself in debt again! ,scorpio,No matter how calm and controlled you may be by nature what happens over the next few days will test your self-restraint. Hopefully you will resist the urge to react in kind because no matter what upsets you it’s just not worth the effort.
scorpio,You will find it easy to show affection today, even if you are the kind of Scorpio who prefers to keep your feelings to yourself. You don’t need to go over the top but you do need to let loved ones know you still care for them.
scorpio,You may be resentful that changes of one kind or another have been imposed on you but there is no point making a fuss about it. Go with the flow and don’t draw attention to yourself. You will get the chance to change things back again later on. ,scorpio,You will think fast and act fast today and it may be frustrating when you have to slow down because the people up ahead of you are dragging their feet. Stay calm and look for intelligent ways to get past them. Don’t just push your way to the front. ,scorpio,If you fear the worst today it will most likely happen. If you expect the best you will be pleasantly surprised. The Sun’s link with Mercury, planet of the mind, means that good thoughts will more often than not lead to good things. ,scorpio,The only danger now is that in your hurry to get ahead you will forget that other people have feelings too. Be especially careful what you say to work colleagues today because if they feel you are being unfair they will soon turn against you.
scorpio,If you sit back and wait for good things to come your way this weekend you will be disappointed, but if you go out and make things happen you will be amazed how easily you get ahead. Whatever obstacles you face you can find ways around them.
scorpio,Be careful what you say over the next few days because you could easily let slip information that others have no right to know. There is even the possibility that they may be able to use it against you in some way, so keep those lips zipped!,scorpio,You will be pleasantly surprised by what happens over the next 24 hours. Money matters, among other things, will no longer worry you the way they once did but don’t go mad and go on a spree because that will cause trouble all over again.
scorpio,The longer you leave what has to be done the harder it will be to summon up the energy to get started. Also, pay attention to what partners and loved ones try to tell you today. Don’t be too proud to act on their advice.
scorpio,As from today you must put your own needs on hold for a while and do what you can to help loved ones and relatives. The simple fact is that the more you do for others now the more freedom you will have later in the year. Make the effort.
scorpio,Whatever else you do today, don’t panic. Your life is NOT falling apart – you are just looking at things from too negative an angle. You may be a bit down at the moment but later on your mood and your viewpoint will be more positive. ,scorpio,You may be bored with your current situation but what happens over the next few days will cheer you up no end. When Mercury, planet of the mind, turns in your favor again on Monday life will become a lot more fun than it has been of late.
scorpio,If you have not yet made up your mind about taking a trip of some kind you must get your act together over the next 48 hours. According to the planets you are running out of time, so don’t hesitate: pack a bag and go.
scorpio,Today’s full moon cuts across the career axis of your solar chart, reminding you to get the balance right between your work and your home life over the next few days. Don’t spend so much time trying to impress the Important People that you neglect the Very Important People – your family.
scorpio,You will receive invites left, right and center over the next few days but there is one event that stands out from the rest, not least because it will give you the chance to rub shoulders with important people. Time for a bit of social climbing!,scorpio,You need to put a family squabble behind you once and for all and begin a new chapter of domestic harmony. You cannot change the past but you can change your attitude towards it, so forgive, forget and force yourself to move on – together.
scorpio,Partners and loved ones have been rather demanding of late and you are getting tired of having to be there for them 24/7. Never mind. It won’t be long before the cosmic picture changes and you can start making a few demands of your own! ,scorpio,Someone new will come into your life over the next few days and they will open your eyes to new possibilities. They will also remind you that, important as your own affairs may be, there is a world out there that cannot and must not be ignored. ,scorpio,You have a tendency to get emotional over little things and that tendency is now heightened by the Sun in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart. Try not to overreact over the next 24 hours – no more than usual anyway! ,scorpio,There have been quite a few crossed lines of late, especially in friendships and relationships, but as from this weekend everything will be crystal clear again. There can be no more excuses, either for them or for you, for getting it wrong.
scorpio,You have an almost overwhelming desire to take certain people by the scruff of the neck and shake some sense into them. So what’s stopping you? You will find it easy to be assertive this week. Chances are you will make your point – and get your way.
scorpio,You will feel good about yourself today and because of that you will be more open to the world around you. Wherever you go and whatever you do, stay calm. Minor annoyances are a fact of life – but you don’t have to let them spoil your life. ,scorpio,No matter how formidable your rivals may be you can still defeat them. While they are bragging about what they are going to do and how much money they are going to make you will be actually getting on with things. It’s the Scorpio way.
scorpio,You are not the sort who takes kindly to others disagreeing with you but like it or not a friend or family member will ignore your advice and follow their own path today. Don’t make an issue of it. You can say “I told you so” later! ,scorpio,You may be tempted to hit back at someone who is giving you a hard time but is that such a good idea? It might be just what they are hoping for, because then it gives them the excuse they have been waiting for to start an open fight. ,scorpio,Some of the people you feel closest to emotionally are feeling a bit neglected, so make it your aim to spend more time with them. Besides, the phase you have just been through was immensely busy and both your body and your mind deserve some down time.
scorpio,You seem to be having second thoughts about something that only a while ago you were convinced was the right thing to do. Resist the temptation to make wholesale changes because your confidence and enthusiasm will return in the early part of next week.
scorpio,Loved ones and relatives will be in a fun-loving mood over the next few days and family gatherings will be something to look forward to rather than something to dread. The only thing that matters is that you are together and enjoying each other’s company.
scorpio,Some people you like and some people you don’t and it will always be that way. With that thought in mind don’t feel you have to pretend that someone who rubs you up the wrong way is your friend. You don’t have to be dishonest about it.
scorpio,Listen to what friends have to tell you today. They have a wealth of experience that can be used to sidestep the pitfalls and obstacles that will appear along your path. You will only have yourself to blame if you make mistakes that could have been avoided. ,scorpio,Doors that have been shut to you in the past will be flung wide open over the next few days. Why the sudden change? Most likely it is because you have stopped trying so hard to be accepted – so it’s no longer fun for others to say “no”.
scorpio,It’s not like you to keep loved ones on a short leash but for some strange reason you have been trying to curb their freedom. It won’t work. You would not accept restrictions on your own movements so don’t try to impose them on others. ,scorpio,You have far too many things on the go at the moment. If a friend drops hints that they need your support you may feel obliged to give it but before you do make sure they know there are limits. And know your own limits too.
scorpio,Mars in your birth sign makes you a bit argumentative and with Mars linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, this weekend there is a danger you will go way over the top. But what of it? At least people know where they stand with you.
scorpio,Mars in your sign makes you super confident, but you must make sure your dreams have a basis in reality. Flights of fancy can be fun but if you have got your head in the clouds you also need to keep your feet on the ground.
scorpio,If you limit yourself to tried and tested ways over the next two or three days you will not only make unnecessary work for yourself but you may miss out on something that could have made your life richer and more enjoyable. Move with the times. ,scorpio,The choices you make over the next 48 hours will be crucial as far as your work or career is concerned, so think carefully and then act. Decide what your number one priority is going to be and focus on that to the exclusion of everything else. ,scorpio,Make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for before backing some kind of creative venture. Just because you trust someone does not mean they know what they are talking about. It will pay you to check facts and figures for yourself. ,scorpio,The Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today and before you know it you will be moving so fast you will have trouble catching your breath. If you make an extra special effort now you will reap big rewards further down the road. ,scorpio,The sad fact is you cannot completely trust what other people tell you at the moment. Even if they are well-meaning they may not be in possession of all the facts. The only voice you need to heed is the small, soft voice that comes from within.
scorpio,You could get carried away and make the kind of silly mistake that someone with your brains should be able to avoid. If you do get it wrong don’t make things worse by refusing to accept that you are at fault. You’re human like the rest of us.
scorpio,With the Sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart no one and nothing can stop you. But you can still stop yourself, simply by allowing your fears to get the better of you. Ignore the doubts the full moon is putting into your head. ,scorpio,The thing you need to remember most today is that no one has the right to tell you how to behave or how to manage your affairs. There is no point arguing with certain people – they won’t understand – just get on and do what feels right to you.
scorpio,Mars in your sign makes you hugely ambitious but there will always be things you cannot do on your own and you need to recognize and respect that fact today. Reach out to people who share your passion and principles. Together you will achieve something remarkable. ,scorpio,This is an emotional time for you and you need to be careful not to let little, everyday things get you down. Strive to see the good in your life and in everyone you know. It’s still there – it just takes a bit more effort to recognize. ,scorpio,If you rise to the challenges that face you today you will find ways to turn them to your advantage. Family ties will also work in your favor, so let loved ones and relatives know what you are up to and what it is you need.
scorpio,Your confidence levels are on the rise and before the weekend is over you will be more like your old self again. Creative and artistic activities are especially well starred, so follow your muse and see where it leads you – maybe to fame and fortune!,scorpio,The Sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart makes this one of the best times of the year for you. You must do something out of the ordinary. You must do something big. It cannot fail, so what are you waiting for?,scorpio,It may be true that your working life is in a bit of a rut but don’t go doing anything drastic about it just yet. For the next few days at least you are advised to sit back, relax and watch (and laugh at) the passing parade.
scorpio,The thing you need to remember most today is that no one has the right to tell you how to behave or how to manage your affairs. There is no point arguing with certain people – they won’t understand – just get on and do what feels right to you.
scorpio,Are you any closer to reaching the targets you set yourself around the time of your last birthday? If not, it may be time to adjust your sights a bit. Remember, your goals don’t have to be set in stone – you can change them any time you wish.
scorpio,Try not to make a big issue of whatever it is you are expected to do over the next 24 hours. Take it in your stride and let it develop at its own natural pace. It will only get complicated if you make it complicated – so don’t!,scorpio,You seem to be constantly on the go of late, no doubt due to the presence of Mars, planet of ego and energy, in your birth sign. However, common sense should tell you that even a Scorpio has limits, so slow down and focus only on essentials. ,scorpio,The Sun in Pisces, now joined by mind planet Mercury, urges you to express yourself creatively. You may not much like being the center of attention but once your artistic side kicks in you won’t mind who stares at you. The more the merrier.
scorpio,Don’t turn down an invitation during the early part of the week just because you don’t like the person involved. Yes, there will be friction if you get together but there will be great success as well. Tension can be creative.
scorpio,You can at times be a bit too harsh on yourself, especially when you fail to live up to the impossibly high standards you try to live by. Be more forgiving of yourself today. Despite what some people might say you are only human.
scorpio,Don’t go to pieces if someone is critical of your performance today. Most likely they are just trying to help by pointing out where they think you have been going wrong. But whatever the reason, there is no need to get upset about it.
scorpio,You rarely sell yourself short and today will be no exception. With a fantastic solar eclipse in your fellow Water sign of Pisces you honestly believe you can take on the world and win – and won’t be in the least bit shy about saying so!,scorpio,There is a spring in your step and a smile on your face at the moment and that’s nice. Recent events may have been tough but everything seems to be coming easy to you now. There really is no limit to how far you can go. ,scorpio,Sit back, relax and let fate guide your steps. You may have big ambitions but you don’t have to hammer away at them each and every day. Even a Scorpio needs some down time occasionally. You will certainly need it over the next 24 hours.
scorpio,Don’t do anything too strenuous this weekend. Venus, planet of harmony, is strong in your chart now, so sit back, kick off your shoes and enjoy the passing parade. People watching can be so much fun, especially when they are not watching back.
scorpio,It may annoy you that certain plans have to be put on hold because other people can’t get their act together, but it may be a blessing in disguise. Use the extra time to go back and double check the details on which your plans depend.
scorpio,You have a great deal of energy at your disposal at the moment and you should be looking to use it for creative and constructive purposes. So much is possible for you now, so don’t waste your time and your energy on senseless feuds.
scorpio,You may honestly believe that you know what is best but that does not give you the right to impose your solutions on other people. All you can do is speak your truth as you see it and let partners and loved ones make their own choices. ,scorpio,Make sure there is no way employers or other important people can criticize you for doing a bad job. With Jupiter linked to your ruler Pluto most things will come easy to you, but there is also a danger you might take your good reputation for granted. ,scorpio,Travel and social plans may be delayed over the next 24 hours but there is no point getting annoyed because that will just make matters worse. If someone lets you down just accept it as one of those things – it’s hardly the end of the world. ,scorpio,The Sun’s move into the work area of your chart in just a few days means you may need to take on new chores and responsibilities. But know when to say “no” – and mean it. Not even a Scorpio can do everything. Think of your wellbeing too. ,scorpio,If you are the kind of Scorpio who lets other people take care of the details you could put yourself at a serious disadvantage. Yes, the big picture is important but if you overlook the small stuff it could cause you problems later on.
scorpio,There is a danger you will take on too much over the next few days and put your health at risk. Just because others expect you to deliver does not mean you have to exhaust yourself. You will be no good to anyone if you collapse.
scorpio,You will get through twice as much work as you usually manage over the coming week, but you must give yourself regular breaks as well. Take time to relax both your mind and your body – and return to the fray refreshed and re-energized.
scorpio,Draw up a schedule that is comfortable for you and stick with it. Your prime concern now is your health, so let partners and colleagues know that you will not run yourself into the ground in pursuit of their aims. Your needs come first. ,scorpio,Intense cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart suggests that matters of a highly personal nature will come to a head over the next 24 hours. You will have no choice but to make the kind of decisions you often prefer to avoid. ,scorpio,It’s time to admit that you are getting nowhere with a project and must call it a day. Don’t think of it as a failure, think of it as a learning experience. At least you had the guts to give it a go. Next time you will get it right. ,scorpio,Your workload has increased dramatically of late and will increase again over the next 24 hours unless you draw a line. Let certain people know that you are doing as much as you can and will do no more for the time being. And mean it. ,scorpio,You may have to pair up with someone you don’t like over the next 48 hours but it will only be a temporary alliance, so get on with it. Sometimes you just have to hold your tongue, and your nose too, and do what is expected of you. ,scorpio,You will see something this week that your rivals have missed and if you are smart you will turn it to your advantage. Is it wrong to benefit from other people’s mistakes? Of course not. They would not hesitate to benefit from yours.
scorpio,What is your special talent? If you are not sure then now is the time to give it some serious thought. What is the one thing that feels most natural to you? What is the one thing that makes you feel most alive? That’s where your talent is. ,scorpio,You may lose your temper with someone you usually get along with quite well today but it’s no big deal. There is a lot of tension in the air at the moment, so minor disputes are to be expected. The word “sorry” will come in handy. ,scorpio,You need to think carefully before making changes, especially if those changes could affect your ability to make a living or jeopardize your position on the work front. By far the best thing you can do right now is to leave well alone.
scorpio,You have a mountain of work to get though but you really cannot be bothered. In which case, go easy on yourself and leave it for another day. If you force yourself to act when you don’t want to the results will be average at best. ,scorpio,You don’t need to cut corners or use underhand methods to get to the top. As a Scorpio you possess the focus and the staying power to wear down your rivals. Your never-say-die approach to life is all you need to succeed.
scorpio,The movement of Venus into the work area of your chart urges you to worry less about your chores and duties and go out and have fun. One day you will look back and wonder what you did with your time. Will your memories be happy ones? ,scorpio,The only danger now is that you could get so embroiled in details that you forget what the big picture looks like. Take time out from your busy schedule to quiet your mind and remember what it’s all about and what it’s all for.
scorpio,What you hear today may not fill you with the joys of spring but don’t overreact. The news may sound bad but most likely this is one of those occasions when the appearance is worse than the reality. You can still end the day with a smile.
scorpio,Fate, in its wisdom, has decided that you need to work more in an area that does not come easy to you. Don’t try to evade what you are being asked to do. Far from being a bad thing it will open up new opportunities for you. ,scorpio,You need to talk less and think more, especially on the work front where, if you say the wrong thing, it could do your prospects a great deal of harm. Under no circumstances try to defend a position if you don’t know all the facts. You will lose. ,scorpio,Do dreams and wishes really come true? Yes, they do and what happens next will prove it to you. If there is something you have always wanted to do you will get the chance this weekend. It is your destiny to be happy and successful.
scorpio,The Sun’s transit of the work and wellbeing area of your chart warns you may have pushed yourself a bit too hard in recent weeks. Make a conscious effort to slow down over the coming week. It’s better than breaking down. ,scorpio,If someone you live or work with has not been pulling their weight then it’s time to let them know you demand better from them. If you don’t do it now they will take it as a sign that you are weak and will do as they please.
scorpio,Take care when dealing with people you work or do business with, because the planets warn someone may try to confuse you and, ultimately, cheat you out of what you deserve. Wake up to reality: not everyone is as honest as you.
scorpio,You will make a significant breakthrough on the work front over the next 24 hours. After all the fussing and fighting of the past few weeks you will finally see your efforts begin to pay off. You’ve come so far – now go the extra mile. ,scorpio,If you are on the move today you will most likely meet someone who brings love or luck – or both – into your life. Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will smooth your path to success and make it easy for you to show your best side. ,scorpio,There have been times of late when the pressure built up to such an extent that you were tempted to give up. But you didn’t. You stuck at it and over the next few days you will begin to see the benefits of that decision.
scorpio,You seem reluctant to take chances at the moment. Maybe that’s no bad thing though as the planets suggest if you let yourself go over the next 48 hours you could make some silly mistakes. Also, don’t spend what you don’t have.
scorpio,You may want life to stay as it is but that is not going to happen. Certain things will go out of your world this coming week but it will make room for better things to come in. Change is good, so welcome it.
scorpio,You may be in a bit of a confrontational mood at the moment but it won’t last for long. You know instinctively that your interests and other people’s interests are related and will go out of your way to make sure everyone benefits.
scorpio,You will need to pay extra attention to partnership matters, both at home and at work, over the next few days. If you are used to getting your own way you must learn how to compromise. Don’t forget though that compromise is a two-way street.
scorpio,You feel as if you are being moved in a direction you don’t want to go but it is very much in your interests that you play along. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Taurus will give you the push you need to make changes.
scorpio,Partners and loved ones seem more demanding now but it is nothing to worry about. Most likely it just means that they are focused on certain issues that mean a lot to them but probably not so much to you. Ease their fears if you can. ,scorpio,You must keep your head today, even when everyone else is running around like it’s the end of the world. Whatever the cause of the current mayhem you can be sure that in the greater scheme of things it is of no real importance.
scorpio,You are a law unto yourself at the moment but the planets warn that at some point you will come up against an obstacle that stops you in your tracks. Everyone has limits, even a Scorpio, and that means limits to your behavior as well.
scorpio,The Sun in your opposite sign brings partnership problems to the fore but at the same time it makes it easier to solve them. Strive to see things from the other person’s point of view. It’s unlikely to be that different from your own.
scorpio,It may be annoying that events over which you have no control are stopping you from following your desires but in time you will realize it was for your own good. The Sun in Taurus at this time of year demands that you put other people’s desires first. ,scorpio,No matter how desperate you may be to change things you would be wise not to throw out what has worked well for you in the past. The best changes are those that build on what went before, and you have achieved so much already. ,scorpio,Although the Sun in your opposite sign is making life difficult for you, others have it much worse, so don’t turn your back on a friend or colleague if they come to you for assistance. By helping them you may find you help yourself too.
scorpio,You will need to be on your guard over the next 24 hours, especially when dealing with people who envy your success and covet what you possess, be it something of a material nature or a social rank or a relationship. Don’t let them take it.
scorpio,You may be under pressure to do things for other people, but don’t be in too much of a hurry to deliver. If you refuse to lend a helping hand what is the most likely outcome? At worst you will lose a “friend” who never does anything for you. ,scorpio,You will be on good terms with everyone this weekend as Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the partnership area of your chart. If a loved one gives you advice you would be wise to take it. They know what they are talking about.
scorpio,Someone, somewhere thinks you’re the best thing since sliced bread. It’s nice to be appreciated, of course, but don’t let their flattery lull you into a false sense of security. Keep your feet on the ground, even though your head is in the clouds.
scorpio,Affairs of the heart are high on your agenda now the Sun is moving through your opposite sign. If a relationship has not been running as smoothly as it should now is the time to turn on the charm. They won’t be able to resist you.
scorpio,If your sixth sense tells you that someone is keeping things from you then by all means confront them with your suspicions. They will deny everything, of course, but your keen Scorpio mind will grasp in an instant what is really going on. ,scorpio,Fireworks of one sort or another are more likely than not today but it won’t result in much long-term harm, so don’t worry. Friday’s new moon will make it easy for you to heal rifts, so stay calm. You don’t have to light that fuse!,scorpio,Saturn, the taskmaster of the zodiac, will bring you back to your senses and make you realize that some of the things you said recently were over the top. You may not want to say sorry but if you are wise you will say it now. ,scorpio,If you have been finding it hard to make a decision of some kind you will finally see the light over the next two or three days. The mental block that has been holding you back will disappear as if it never existed. Onwards and upwards!,scorpio,By all means help those in need this weekend but don’t get conned by others who just cannot be bothered to help themselves. You have only so much time, energy and sympathy to go round, so make sure it gets to the right people.
scorpio,Someone will drop an emotional bombshell during the early part of the week. After the initial shock has passed you will realize you should have seen it coming – the signs have been there for some time. It’s life. It happens. Move on.
scorpio,Something unexpected, and rather nice, will happen over the next 24 hours, something that demands your full attention. If it means you have to postpone a get-together with your friends then so be it. You can make it up to them later.
scorpio,Venus in the partnership area of your chart means you can expect some warmer-than-usual responses from loved ones over the next 24 hours. Don’t be suspicious if someone you fell out with wants to kiss and make up. Yes, they do mean it! ,scorpio,There is no need to push yourself hard now because everything you require will be given to you as and when you need it. One of the keys to a happy existence is to have simple needs and to enjoy simple pleasures. That won’t be difficult today. ,scorpio,Are you living up to your highest ideals? If you are honest you will no doubt admit that your standards have slipped a bit of late and that you need to get serious about raising them again. What can you do today to improve your reputation? ,scorpio,There will be a succession of minor crises over the next few days but none of them should be taken seriously. Stay calm and refuse to believe that a big emotional display is the only way to cope with negative news. You have other options.
scorpio,You are clearly in the mood for romance and if you cannot find affection in one direction you won’t hesitate to look for it somewhere else. A new relationship is very much on the cards this weekend – and it could be the love of your life.
scorpio,You could easily take on too much or take the kind of risk that goes wrong. Yes, you are on the verge of something big – you can feel it in your bones – but if you are not careful it could be a big loss rather than a big gain. ,scorpio,Certain people will be more assertive than usual over the next two or three days but that’s okay. They don’t mean to do you any harm but it may still be smart to let them see that you are not the sort to be cowed by displays of aggression.
scorpio,The more you have been holding your emotions in check the more likely it is that your feelings will pour out in one huge burst between now and the full moon at the weekend. Hopefully it won’t be destructive but you will certainly feel better for it. ,scorpio,Think carefully before you make a decision but, having made it, stick with it come what may. You need to know where you stand and others need to know where they stand as well. There have been enough misunderstandings already.
scorpio,According to the planets you have been living beyond your means for quite some time and if you don’t do something about it soon you could find yourself in trouble. Don’t waste money on luxury items you really don’t need to possess.
scorpio,Tread carefully when dealing with other people’s financial affairs, because if you make a wrong move it could cost both them and you a fortune. Don’t pretend you know the answer to their questions just because you don’t want to look ignorant.
scorpio,If you try to pass off as fact what is clearly just an opinion you will be found out – and the outcome could be costly for you. Others will put you on the spot and demand to know on what evidence you base your assumptions. Can you tell them? ,scorpio,Just because everyone else seems to be taking risks does not mean you should be taking risks too. You have never been the kind of person who follows the herd, so don’t start now. Go your own way and do your own thing.
scorpio,Sometimes you put on a fierce face without knowing it and scare away people who could easily be friends, or even lovers. The good news is you will find it easy to reach out and make contact today, even more so if you practice your smile!,scorpio,Know your limits and stay within them. That is the message of the stars and while it may be less than inspirational it’s definitely the right course for you at the moment. You don’t have to be a star every day of the week.
scorpio,More than anything now you need to accept that bad things sometimes happen and all you can do is to make the best of them. Focusing on negative events only prolongs the pain, so clear your mind of dark thoughts and get back in the game. ,scorpio,Some people you like and some people you don’t – and that is the beginning, middle and end of it. Anyone who tries to tell you to be more open to people whose ways you disapprove of will find their names added to your “avoid” list. ,scorpio,As Mars moves back into your birth sign today you will most likely have to go back and do something a second time that you did not quite get right the first time. With the benefit of hindsight you will, this time, make an excellent job of it. ,scorpio,Over the next few days you will begin to see connections between things that did not look connected in the past. Whether you realize it or not there is a design to your life, so listen to and act on what your intuition tells you. ,scorpio,If your money situation is not as strong as you would like it to be, now is the time to make changes. This is an especially good time for financial planning and the decisions you make over the next few days will pay off later in the year.
scorpio,You will need to keep your wits about you today because someone is going to try to take from you more than they are entitled to. If you catch them red-handed you must be tough and cut them out of your life once and for all. ,scorpio,What happens today may not look good but neither is it as bad as you think, so be positive and deal quickly and resolutely with the situation. Moaning about how unfair life is won’t change a thing. But, of course, you’re not the moaning kind. ,scorpio,You may feel that a rival has taken a position that belongs to you but there is no point getting worked up about it. According to the planets the situation is not as dire as you fear and you will soon get the chance to be top dog again.
scorpio,If you cannot stand being in a certain person’s company then by all means find an excuse to go off on your own for a while. By this time tomorrow you will have calmed down enough to see that, actually, they’re not really that bad after all.
scorpio,Try not to get too angry today because your temper will go from nought to sixty in two seconds flat. Most people, sensing your displeasure, will stay out of your way but anyone who moves too slowly or says too much could be in mega trouble.
scorpio,Try not to get too angry today because your temper will go from nought to sixty in two seconds flat. Most people, sensing your displeasure, will stay out of your way but anyone who moves too slowly or says too much could be in mega trouble. ,scorpio,This week’s new moon means it is time to get serious about what you own and earn and what you possess. Think long-term and don’t let your frivolous friends influence you. Just because they throw their cash around does not mean you have to as well. ,scorpio,There is no point worrying about a mistake you made in the past. In fact, the more you dwell on the subject the more likely it is you will make yourself depressed. What’s done is done and cannot be undone – so move on.
scorpio,Money matters and business issues are under excellent stars at the moment but Pluto, your ruler, warns you need to be wary of getting involved in areas you don’t know much about. There’s plenty of profit to be made closer to home.
scorpio,There is no point expecting others to be reasonable today because it isn’t going to happen. The only way you are going to get things done, and get them done right, is if you do them yourself. Don’t ask permission – just get on with it.
scorpio,What you are told by a friend could get you into trouble today if you take it seriously. They may not be lying as such but they clearly don’t have a very good grasp on reality at the moment. But you do, so ignore them. ,scorpio,Make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for before signing up for a plan or project that might require you to put in some of your own money. It does not hurt to be careful, especially when it is your livelihood that is at stake. ,scorpio,Employers and other important people will be impressed by your can-do attitude this weekend but don’t go over the top and take on too much or you may have to admit later on that you overextended yourself – and that won’t be good for your image.
scorpio,Make an effort to talk to people who can further your ambitions. They cannot read your mind – which is probably just as well! – so you will have to point out for them what it is you need and what you can do for them in return. ,scorpio,If life is a bit stale at the moment by all means do something to shake it up a bit. But only a bit. You have a tendency to go to extremes and if you do that today it may tempt rivals to do likewise. Think before you act.
scorpio,Don’t be afraid to give orders to those you live, work and do business with because they will respond well to your assertive attitude. You need to remember, however, that there is a huge difference between being assertive and being arrogant. ,scorpio,The planets warn if you let your guard down for even a moment today a rival will take advantage. Money matters, especially, are a minefield right now, so resist the urge to take risks because chances are they won’t pay off – not for you anyway. ,scorpio,Act quickly if you have a good idea or if you see an opening that your rivals appear to have missed. It is okay to be forceful now, so long as you have a long-term goal in mind. Be selfish Scorpio, but be selfish for a reason. ,scorpio,No matter how unsettled things may be at the moment you will take it all in your stride. Your ability to stay calm when the world is raging around you will inspire friends and family and colleagues alike. You’re their rock in a storm.
scorpio,Your mind may be full of big ideas but you are advised not to take any of them too seriously. Your priority this weekend must be to knuckle down and take care of details. That might not sound like fun but it’s safe and that’s what matters.
scorpio,You may be tempted to do something out of the ordinary over the next few days – and if you are smart you will give in to that urge and do it. The Sun’s move in your favor tomorrow makes all things possible, so don’t set any limits.
scorpio,The Sun in your fellow Water sign of Cancer urges you to be more adventurous. Leave the daily grind behind you for a while and go some place where there are smiling faces and happy people. They will help make you happy too.
scorpio,According to the planets you lack enthusiasm for what you are about to do, so why not just forget about it? Why put yourself under pressure, especially for something you do not believe in? Targets and time limits can always be changed. ,scorpio,What a Scorpio wants a Scorpio gets and if anyone is foolish enough to stand in your way over the next 24 hours, well, they won’t be standing for long. There is not much doubt that you will get your way over the next 24 hours. ,scorpio,You can and you must accomplish something that lasts and that gets you noticed for all the rights reasons. What you work on over the next few days may not be exciting by your standards but it will lay the foundations for future success. ,scorpio,This is a good time to be on the move, especially if you have found yourself stuck in one place for too long. The Sun in Cancer will ignite your passion for faraway places, and make it easy to reach them. Time to get out the travel brochures!,scorpio,With your ruler Pluto on excellent terms with Jupiter this weekend there is precious little you cannot do. But that does not mean you have to do everything. Wherever possible, let others make the running for you. You’ve earned the right to power down a bit.
scorpio,There are a lot of things you have wanted to say in recent weeks but felt unable to be honest about. Mercury’s change of sign in midweek will encourage you to let the world know what you are thinking. The world will be impressed.
scorpio,You will be incredibly adventurous over the next seven days. If you are the sort of Scorpio who likes to travel you could find yourself a long way from home with no idea about how you are going to get back – and you won’t care. ,scorpio,You seem to be in one of your downbeat moods at the moment but that’s a shame because you have so much going for you. Later in the week you will look back and wonder why your attitude was so negative. Try being more positive now.
scorpio,There is a danger that you could be a bit too casual and let others get away with things they do not deserve to get away with. Money and investments need careful handling too. You must keep your personal feelings out of business issues. ,scorpio,Don’t make any sudden decisions about what you own and earn over the next 24 hours. Things are unlikely to be as bad as they seem, so calm down and keep reminding yourself that there are more important things in life than money.
scorpio,The more someone tries to press you into doing what you know is not right the more you must refuse to play ball. Don’t let them make you feel guilty by suggesting that your refusal will ruin it for everyone else. That’s emotional blackmail.
scorpio,Before you take any important decisions this weekend you must make sure you have all the facts at your fingertips. If you are missing even a small piece of information it could mean you make exactly the kind of mistake you were hoping to avoid.
scorpio,Your confidence will soar over the next few days, making it easy for you to make changes in your lifestyle. If the travel bug bites don’t hesitate: just pack a bag and get going. Anything done on the spur of the moment is sure to be fun. ,scorpio,If you feel strongly about something then you must act on it right away. It may be an unpopular measure but you have never been one to care what other people think. Trust your inner voice and let it guide you to success.
scorpio,Resist the urge to make some kind of major change today. You will get the chance to improve things later in the week when first Mercury then the Sun link with Jupiter but for now you should just sit back, relax and watch the passing parade. ,scorpio,All the petty upsets and restrictions of the past few weeks are beginning to fade and before you know it life will be fun again. This is one of the best times of the year for you, both socially and romantically, so make sure you enjoy it.
scorpio,Cosmic activity in the sympathetic sign of Cancer will make this a day to remember. Aim high over the next 24 hours, because there is no limit to how far you can go and how much you can accomplish. Self-belief is all you need. ,scorpio,Have faith in your ideals and don’t be afraid to stick your neck out and take a risk. You know deep down that you are on the right track and that what you are working on is meaningful, so keep going. You are under cosmic protection.
scorpio,You will soon get the chance to move up to a new level as far as your career is concerned, but you need to be well prepared. New opportunities will open up in various directions and you must be the one to take advantage of them.
scorpio,You will have to make some quick decisions over the next few days and they are more likely to be the correct decisions if you trust your instincts. Don’t worry if some people make fun of you. The joke will be on them when you succeed.
scorpio,Make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for before parting with your hard-earned cash. Both at work and at home it will pay you to check facts and figures for yourself. Just this once it’s okay to be a suspicious Scorpio.
scorpio,No matter how ambitious a Scorpio you may be what happens over the next 24 hours will remind you that there is more to life than fighting your way to the top. What about laughter? What about love? What about all those dreams you had?,scorpio,Your confidence may be high but that is not an invitation to take silly risks. The planets warn you are being misled by someone who knows how to pull your strings. Also, watch out you don’t mislead yourself. Self-deception could be a problem. ,scorpio,One of the most important times of the year is about to begin. On the work front, especially, you will get the opportunity to show what you can do and you must seize it. If you allow the chance to pass it may not come around again.
scorpio,You have a lot of people depending on you at the moment and that means you must stay calm and stay focused on what is important. The good news is you won’t have to do it alone: someone will offer to help you today and you must accept.
scorpio,Mars in your sign makes you hugely ambitious but there are still plenty of things you cannot do on your own. Reach out to people who share your passion and your principles. Together you can achieve something that makes the world a better place.
scorpio,The upcoming full moon will in some way or other force you to do the opposite of what you are doing now. There is no point resisting because it won’t change a thing. Just get on and do what others expect of you. And do it well.
scorpio,This is still one of the most positive times of the year for you but it will come to an end quite soon, so be ready to change gears, and maybe change ambitions too. Don’t be afraid to make new beginnings. Changes are good for you.
scorpio,There is no point trying to please everyone because most likely you will end up pleasing no one. Instead, try pleasing the one person who matters more than all the others put together – yourself. Whatever you do today, do it with a smile.
scorpio,There is so much going on in your world that you may be having trouble keeping track of it all. Who can you turn to for some advice? Keep your eyes and ears open today – something or someone will give you the guidance you seek. ,scorpio,You may or may not be ambitious by nature but you will certainly want to get yourself noticed over the next few days. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart tomorrow will thrust you into the spotlight. Put on a show. ,scorpio,The time has come to show the world what you can do. The Sun in Leo over the next few weeks will give a much-needed boost to your ambitions but don’t think that means success will land in your lap – you will have to work hard for it. ,scorpio,Be honest with yourself about your needs and desires. For quite some time now you have pretended that certain things mean nothing to you when, in fact, you secretly crave them. That craving will reach a peak today, so go on, indulge yourself.
scorpio,You must not limit your thinking. You must not limit the way you look at the world. What you discover about the nature of reality over the next few days will astound and delight you. The world is a beautiful place and it has meaning too.
scorpio,Something will happen today that disrupts your routine and you won’t be happy about it. But why get upset when there is nothing you can do to change things? Go with the flow and believe that fate knows what is best for you.
scorpio,Steer clear of those who rub you up the wrong way. Some people are so full of their own importance they think they can do or say anything and get away with it, but you know that what goes around will come around again sooner or later.
scorpio,If life seems a bit too easy right now then clearly you need to do something about it. It’s okay to drift along without much of an effort for a while but sooner or later you will get bored. It’s time to find new mountains to climb. ,scorpio,All routes lead to your ultimate destination, so don’t think you have to change direction. Besides, it is not where you go or what you do that is important but what you learn about yourself along the way. Let that be your guide. ,scorpio,Do you really need your life to be so regimented, so organized? Probably not. The good news is that now Uranus is entering one of its retrograde phases you will find it easier to break out of self-imposed restrictions. You don’t need them. ,scorpio,You will be in the public eye a lot over the next few days, especially on Tuesday when a new moon in the career area of your chart adds star quality to your many other positive traits. Get used to being the center of attention.
scorpio,You will be in the public eye a lot over the next few days, especially on Tuesday when a new moon in the career area of your chart adds star quality to your many other positive traits. Get used to being the center of attention.
scorpio,There have been times of late when you seemed to lose direction but now your target is crystal clear: you know exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it. Make sure you don’t lose sight of your aims and ambitions so easily again.
scorpio,Today’s new moon promises if you pluck up your courage and put yourself forward you will make friends with the kind of people who can give your career a boost. You can and you must be more ambitious. Go all out for success.
scorpio,Maybe you will come into money today or maybe you will discover that you are not as deeply in debt as you feared. Either way your cashflow situation will improve considerably, as will your mood. No, that is not an excuse to go on a spree!,scorpio,Don’t look back and wonder what might have been – look forward and make a bright new future for yourself. Any regrets you still have about what you should or should not have done must be cast from your mind once and for all. ,scorpio,You may not be a sensitive type by nature but you never hesitate to offer your help when a friend is in difficulties. Today it may be a bit more difficult in that it is a stranger who needs your assistance, but you will give it anyway.
scorpio,Rewards for the sacrifices you have made will start to come your way and at last you will feel appreciated by the powers that be. Don’t let those who have not been so fortunate tell you that your good fortune is not deserved. No one deserves it more.
scorpio,If you believe in a cause strongly enough then you must roll up your sleeves and do something practical. It is not enough to make a charitable donation or to cheer from the back of the room – you must get personally involved.
scorpio,Resist the temptation to start something new, especially if there is money involved. Anything you begin on impulse now could turn out to be a financial burden later on. Don’t listen to those who say you must act quickly – think for yourself.
scorpio,Get out into the world and have some fun. If you allow yourself to see and be seen you will soon be having the time of your life. Even if you are the kind of Scorpio who is shy by nature you will be at the center of things today.
scorpio,You are lusting after something (or someone) you cannot have and it is eating you up inside. Make an effort to see why the universe is denying you. Most likely if your wish was to be granted you would very soon regret it.
scorpio,The planets are urging you to strike out in a new direction and deep down you know it is what you most want to do. If you think about it too much you will come up with a thousand reasons for not moving forward, so don’t think – act!,scorpio,Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours. You will actually accomplish more if you do less, so give yourself some breathing space and take life as it comes. Don’t aim to impress others, demand that they impress you. ,scorpio,You must not let the line between fact and fantasy get blurred over the next 48 hours. Be especially careful where money matters and business issues are concerned because if you get the wrong end of the stick it could cost you dear.
scorpio,Disruption of one sort or another is inevitable over the next few days. Whatever happens, keep telling yourself that it is not really too bad. Promise yourself too that you will keep your emotions in check. Why get worked up over nothing?,scorpio,Those who know you well won’t believe for one moment the bad things your rivals are saying about you. Those who don’t know you well will see from the calm look on your face that the stories are false. Nothing will faze you today.
scorpio,The Sun’s link to Uranus today makes it easier than ever to move forward in your work or career. Important people will be on your side and if you follow their advice you will soon be moving up in the world, maybe faster than you expected.
scorpio,You know what it is you desire and you know where and how you can get it. What you don’t know, yet, is that someone in a position of authority is determined to stop you from getting it. Should be an interesting few days. ,scorpio,If you have something to say – or, more likely, something to complain about – you must get it off of your chest immediately because no one will have the time to listen to you over the weekend. Speak up while you have the chance.
scorpio,You will have to make a difficult choice over the next 48 hours and you must not put it off to a later date. The Sun’s imminent change of signs means if you don’t act now you may miss out on a reward that is yours by right.
scorpio,It won’t be long before you get the chance to impress some very important people, so make sure you know what you want and make sure they see you as the kind of person who knows how to get things done. Always aim to be the best.
scorpio,You may have a tremendous urge to interfere in matters that have nothing to do with you but if you are smart you will use your formidable willpower to pull yourself back from the brink. If you don’t you will probably regret it.
scorpio,If there is anything you feel strongly about, be it personal, political or social in nature, now is the time to do something about it. Get involved. Get together with like-minded people. You can change the world – if you are on the right team.
scorpio,You don’t have to be a hero or a saint, you just have to be yourself. The problem is you have played so many roles of late that you may be unsure what your real nature is. What happens today will remind you of who you have always been.
scorpio,It would appear that the excesses of the past few weeks have begun to take their toll, so if you value your health you must slow down a bit and give yourself time to recover. Have a quiet night in for a change. Would that be so bad?,scorpio,You can be rather outspoken at times, especially when dealing with people who don’t see things the way you do. However, the planets warn not everyone is happy to just sit there and take it, so expect some people to give as good as they get.
scorpio,Partners, colleagues and even strangers will happily do what you ask of them this weekend. There is a magnetism about you that draws people to you. It makes them feel wanted to make you feel special. Who are you to deny them?,scorpio,You will have to make allowances for those who do not share your optimism and sense of adventure. Remember, everyone is different and everyone has their own talents and abilities. Help others be who they are, not who you want them to be.
scorpio,If you feel like taking off into the wide blue yonder then just go. Don’t worry that others might think you are being irresponsible because the fact is you deserve a break. Share your travels with someone you love if you can.
scorpio,Yes, things may look better when looking back but wishing for a time that has gone will not in any way change the present. As from today you must focus on what is to come and how you can make the future a time to look forward to.
scorpio,Don’t waste time fantasizing about ways to turn the clock back because it simply cannot be done. There is no point letting memories of yesteryear rob you of the joys of today, especially when your future is so much brighter than you realize. ,scorpio,You may feel that you can succeed on your own, and maybe you can, but why put in so much effort when you don’t have to? Today’s eclipse urges you to reach out to people who have the same aims as you. Together you can do something fantastic. ,scorpio,You have found it hard in recent weeks to explain why you believe in certain things but over the next few days you will find your tongue again and your arguments will surely win the doubters round to your way of thinking.
scorpio,If you have suffered a loss of some kind in recent days what happens over the next 48 hours will more than make up for it. Remember, happiness is not about winning or losing, it’s about having the right mental and emotional attitude.
scorpio,Your confidence will get a boost over the next few days as friends and loved ones praise you to the skies. Yes, your talents are special and the sooner you believe that the sooner you will move up in the world. You belong at the top. ,scorpio,Stop pretending that you are happy with your lot and start doing the things that will bring a genuine smile back to your face. The more you socialize over the next few days the less you will worry about your troubles, be they real or imagined.
scorpio,If something you wanted to keep secret becomes public knowledge today don’t try to deny it or make excuses for your behavior. People will sense if you are embarrassed or uncomfortable and use it for their own ends. You are who you are. ,scorpio,Not everyone is having such an easy time of it as you, so make allowances and don’t make an issue of it if a friend or relative is rather grouchy today. If they really get on your nerves just put on your headphones and tune them out. ,scorpio,Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours because if you go too far in your criticism of other people you could find they hit back at you just as hard. You are, of course, entitled to your opinions – but then so are they. ,scorpio,Look back over the past few months and take stock of both your successes and your failures. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have not achieved as much as you should have. There is always another tomorrow to look forward to. ,scorpio,You may be tempted to deal with a business issue in an aggressive manner this weekend but if you upset your partners they may not stay partners for long. Your best course of action is to actually take no action at all. Let time resolve the matter.
scorpio,You would like to be friendly, of course, but according to the planets you don’t have the time or the inclination to play the kind of foolish games that others seem to enjoy. Life will be a serious business for you over the next few days.
scorpio,You will want to go out and conquer the world this week and it’s good that you are so ambitious. But an upcoming series of difficult aspects warns it won’t always be easy. Don’t be discouraged if you have to work harder than you expected.
scorpio,Friends and family will rally round today and help you get over an event that has knocked your confidence a bit. In the greater scheme of things it is of only minor importance, so learn what you can from it, then move on quickly.
scorpio,This is a good time to look seriously at what you expect from life and whether you are likely to get it if you continue to follow the path you are taking. Ask yourself some searching questions today – and be ready for some interesting answers. ,scorpio,There may be moments today when you wonder if the efforts you make are truly worth it but don’t give in to despair. What happens over the weekend will remind you just how lucky you are to be surrounded by people who care for you.
scorpio,Try to be more relaxed about your situation this weekend. Even if you are not making the kind of progress you were hoping for you have still learnt a lot in recent weeks and that knowledge will come in useful in the near future.
scorpio,You won’t be in the mood to make compromises today but you need to be aware that if you come across as uncaring or arrogant you could make yourself unpopular. That may not bother you now but it will do later when you need allies. ,scorpio,The only reason a work colleague is pointing the finger of blame at you is because they don’t want the world to notice their own glaring mistakes. There is no reason why you should be the fall guy. Don’t play their silly games.
scorpio,Sometimes you allow what are really quite minor problems to build up in your mind to such an extent that soon they bear no relation to reality. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your current situation, so keep your imagination under control. ,scorpio,One of the most important times of the year is now beginning. Not much may happen in a physical sense but on the mental and emotional levels there will be an intensity about you that has been lacking of late. Remember, you create your own future today. ,scorpio,This could be one of the best days of the year for you, and the next few weeks will be special too. With Venus, planet of love and beauty, moving into your sign good things will come at you from all directions. Enjoy each and every one of them. ,scorpio,There will be times this weekend when it seems as if the whole world is against you, but really it’s just your own glum mood that makes it feel that way. Since when have you been the sort to feel so sorry for yourself? Get over it. ,scorpio,Someone you have not seen for a long time will come back into your life over the next few days. Welcome them with open arms, even if they walked out on you in the first place. You don’t want to drive them away again, do you?,scorpio,You seem to believe that someone is keeping a secret from you, and maybe they are, but there is no point getting worked up about it. Put them out of your mind for the time being and focus on making money – you are surprisingly good at it.
scorpio,You will be in an argumentative mood over the next few days. Just be careful you don’t come on too strong and turn people against you for no good reason. If you do, even close friends and allies may choose to avoid you.
scorpio,It may seem as if much is wrong with the world but in the greater scheme of things few of them actually matter. There is a plan and a design to your existence and if you look for it today you will catch a promising glimpse of the future.
scorpio,You will get the chance to do something remarkable over the next 24 hours. The odds are stacked in your favor for once, so don’t sit at home waiting for good things to happen, get out into the world and do something dynamic and daring. ,scorpio,If you play hard to get today you will send important people the wrong kind of signal. Make an effort to show those in positions of power that you still care and that you are still ambitious – and they will give you a chance to prove yourself.
scorpio,Sooner or later you will have to make changes but the time is not quite right yet, so curb your impatience. Listen to your inner voice this weekend and only act when it tells you to act. What other people say can be safely ignored.
scorpio,However bad certain things may be at the moment they will get better and you will smile again very soon. That may be hard to believe while the Sun is moving through the most sensitive area of your chart, but already there is light on the horizon.
scorpio,Turn your back on the past and think only of the future. What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so forget about your failures, few as they are, and resolve to make a success of the future. And when does the future start? Right now! ,scorpio,The only danger now is that you will be a bit too greedy financially. If material things mean a lot to you it makes it easy for others to pull your strings. It’s the size of your heart that counts, not the size of your bank balance.
scorpio,Let friends and relatives and neighbors know that you are in the mood to be sociable and invite them to help you in some way. This is a great time for strengthening bonds that may have come a bit loose of late.
scorpio,Keep your career plans to yourself, or at the very least make them sound vague. The less others know about what you are going to be doing the better. Once you lose the element of surprise you lose half your power too. ,scorpio,If your heart isn’t in what you are working on then give up on it, at least for a while. Focus on tasks that are enjoyable and do not require much mental or physical effort. Switch off for a while and let the world sort itself out. ,scorpio,Let the cosmic powers that be nudge you in the right direction. Slow down, quiet your mind and let your inner voice speak to you – it knows all the answers and it knows where you can find the happiness and success that you crave.
scorpio,If you want to avoid an unpleasant situation just pretend it does not exist. You are not in the mood for confrontation and there is no law that says you have to face up to people who fill you with dread. Take the easy way out. ,scorpio,Your workload will increase dramatically over the next few days, so make sure you get your chores out of the way as quickly as possible. If you fall behind you may never catch up again and you know how much you hate being under pressure.
scorpio,A good deed you did for a friend or colleague will be repaid in full over the next 24 hours and your rivals will be dismayed to see you benefit. The fact is they are jealous because they can’t match your success. You deserve your good fortune. ,scorpio,Some things are too important to be left to other people, no matter how much you would prefer to delegate. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters and business issues. Take care of deals and details yourself. ,scorpio,You seem to have almost limitless energy at your disposal and the more there is to get done the more you enjoy it. Which is fine, but don’t forget that in the long-term it is quality work that matters. Try doing better rather than doing more. ,scorpio,Do you have a clear idea of what your long-term aims and ambitions are going to be? If not then you must give it some serious thought today, tomorrow and over the weekend. A new solar year is fast approaching – be ready for it. ,scorpio,There is no point trying to tell a loved one that it is not wise to do something because that will make them even more determined to do it. You cannot stop them from making mistakes, nor should you want to – it’s the best way to learn.
scorpio,If you allow yourself to be talked into doing something you don’t want to do this week you will almost certainly regret it later on. There is no easy way to tell people that you can’t help them out. Just say No – and mean it. ,scorpio,If you change something that does not appear to be working today you may regret it later in the week when the Sun moves into your birth sign and you realize that it was fine all along. Try not to make life so hard for yourself.
scorpio,The atmosphere could get a bit dark today and the odds of you falling out with a loved one or a friend are high, especially if you are the kind of Scorpio who hates being told what to do. Try to stay calm. Failing that, apologize quickly.
scorpio,You may be tempted to shout and scream to get what you want but chances are it won’t work – not least because others have seen it all before. Your best bet is to stay calm and pretend that nothing upsets you. One day it may even be true.
scorpio,It’s good of you to want to make other people feel good about themselves but what about you? As from today you must put your own needs first again. You don’t have to be selfish but you do have to recognize that your desires matter too.
scorpio,The Sun moves into your birth sign today and a new solar year gets under way. Forget about everything that went before and set yourself new goals and targets. Yesterday should be no more than a memory – today and tomorrow is where it’s at. ,scorpio,The Sun in your sign makes this the perfect time to start something new. It does not have to be special, it just has to mean something to you. Be bold, be brave and be ready to move in the direction that fate seems to be nudging you.
scorpio,What seems out of focus at the moment will become crystal clear over the next few days as Mercury, planet of the mind, moves into your sign. The good news is you will realize you are still on the right track, so major changes won’t be necessary.
scorpio,Someone will try to undermine your confidence today but it is highly unlikely they will succeed. With both the Sun and Mercury on your side you have rarely been more confident and self-assured. You know your worth – and it’s a lot!,scorpio,Everyone has a talent of some kind and your aim now must be to recognize and focus on your particular skill in life. You don’t have to be the biggest or the best, you just have to be willing to let your inner voice guide you.
scorpio,You will face many challenges over the next few weeks but with so many cosmic influences on your side you have what it takes not only to survive them but to turn them into opportunities to grow and prosper. It’s all about you now Scorpio. ,scorpio,If you find yourself losing interest in what you are doing that is a sure sign you are doing the wrong thing. A change of scene will help but over the longer term a change of career direction may be necessary. Rule nothing out. ,scorpio,Now is the time to be a bit more adventurous and to seek out those who are different or exciting in some way. Don’t worry that you might seem a bit boring to them – in fact in their eyes you may be the one who looks exotic.
scorpio,Today’s new moon will fuel your passion for something that a while ago did not interest you in the slightest. It may be just a passing fad or it may be the start of a brand new chapter but get on with it and don’t let anyone distract you. ,scorpio,Try not to let slip any personal information today, especially when talking with people you are not entirely sure you can trust. The planets warn if you say too much your words could one day be used against you. Scorpios are supposed to be secretive!,scorpio,If your inner voice tells you to be cautious you must act on that information. Others may say that you are being far too suspicious but you can safely ignore them. Deep down you know better than they do. Your instincts won’t let you down.
scorpio,You must not rush into making an important decision. Have the strength to tell those who are putting pressure on you that you will resolve the situation in your own way and in your own time. If they don’t like it they can get a new partner.
scorpio,By all means say “No” to something that others are trying to impose on you – and don’t feel in the least bit guilty about it. You are who you are for a reason and under no circumstances should you pretend to be someone else. ,scorpio,You may be tempted to let a rival off the hook today but the planets warn that might not be such a good idea. If they get the impression that you are a bit of a soft touch they will most likely try to challenge your position again.
scorpio,Don’t be afraid to break the rules this weekend. Other people have been telling you what to do and how to behave for a long time – now you must ignore what they say and follow your instincts, and your instincts say “have fun”.
scorpio,You will need to work closely with certain people over the next few weeks and because you generally prefer to work on your own it won’t always be easy. Yes, of course, some people can be a pain but try to be a bit more forgiving.
scorpio,Your head and your heart are now working in harmony, so anything you begin over the next few days is sure to be a success. Follow your instincts and don’t let anyone talk you into changing your plans. It’s your life and you must control it.
scorpio,The more others sing your praises today the more likely it is they are up to no good, so don’t be taken in by their words. The fact is you don’t need flattery. You know what you are capable of and you know what you are worth.
scorpio,You may have to cut back on social activities for a while as you shift your focus to matters closer to home. The simple fact is you have been neglecting loved ones and relatives and need to make up for it – and that means now, not later.
scorpio,A lot of things will change over the next few days and because you are the sort of person who tends to be suspicious of change you may not be entirely happy about it. Don’t worry. Most if not all these changes will work in your favor.
scorpio,You can do just about what you like at the moment but you would still be wise to take other people’s viewpoints into consideration before taking actions that will affect them as well as yourself. Why risk creating bad feelings when you don’t have to? ,scorpio,Your social life will get a boost this weekend and even if you are the sort of Scorpio who does not much like the party lifestyle you will want to get out there and have a good time. Let your hair down – you will feel better for it.
scorpio,You rarely take kindly to people who disagree with you and the approaching full moon will make it even less likely than usual that you will be happy to agree to differ. You’re right, they’re wrong and that’s it. Got it world? ,scorpio,Today’s full moon in your opposite sign of Taurus will make for some difficult moments with a partner or loved one. If neither of you is willing to back down then just stay out of each other’s way for a while – or maybe a week!,scorpio,When the Sun leaves your birth sign early next week you will know it is time to move in a new direction. In the meantime, don’t be afraid to showcase your talents and don’t hesitate for a moment to put your own interests first.
scorpio,The Sun remains in your sign a few more days only, so make the most of it and make sure you listen to what your inner voice tells you. Critics may say you are heading for disaster but deep down you know you are heading for success. ,scorpio,You believe in yourself with all your heart and there are so many things you still want to do, which is great. But with the Sun changing signs early next week you have got to be quick. Make the most of your opportunities over the next few days.
scorpio,If you have a good idea today most likely someone will try to persuade you to give it a miss. They will say it’s too dangerous, they will say it’s not your style – but what they really mean is they wish they had thought of it first!,scorpio,You may not be looking forward to what you have to do but if you approach it with the right mental attitude it won’t be so bad. Commit yourself to it, make a plan, apply it consistently and, above all, don’t give up on it halfway through.
scorpio,All those great ideas that have been buzzing round your brain must now be weighed in the balance. Be honest with yourself about what they are worth. It does not matter if you reject a dozen of them so long as the one that remains makes you rich.
scorpio,The past few weeks have been hectic to say the least and the momentum you have built up will keep you going for some time. But don’t forget you have limits. If you feel tired today it’s a signal from your body that it’s time to slow down.
scorpio,You will have to make a decision concerning a money matter today and it is important that you reach the right conclusion. Make sure you take into account all relevant facts and figures and don’t let others rush you. You may not get a second chance.
scorpio,You may be reluctant to do anything out of the ordinary today in case it draws attention to yourself but don’t be so negative. Others are more likely to take an interest in what you are up to if you keep an unnaturally low profile. ,scorpio,Don’t think that you can sit back and let the good things in life come to you because even if it happens that way you will still be under using your talents and that’s a crime. Keep the momentum of the past few weeks going – don’t slow down.
scorpio,The union of love planet Venus and your ruler Pluto today means you can charm the birds from the trees. Whatever, or whoever, it is you desire it can so easily be yours – all you have to do is put a name to your desire and then embrace it. ,scorpio,Today’s Mercury-Uranus link makes it a real possibility that you will come up with an idea that could change your life for the better. However, if you have a good idea you must write it down immediately. Capture it while it is fresh in your mind. ,scorpio,Follow your instincts Scorpio, even if they take you in a different direction to everyone else. That applies especially to money matters and business deals. If you sense that something is wrong it might be wise to keep your cash in your pocket.
scorpio,Keep your spending to a minimum over the next few days because others will find plenty of reasons to encourage you to put your hand in your pocket. Anyone who comes to you with a sob story must be told they are wasting their time.
scorpio,Money matters will be much on your mind today and so long as your head rather than your heart is in control you will be okay. If, however, you allow your emotions to influence your judgment you could be heading for choppy financial waters. ,scorpio,Someone will try to take something from you today, but they will only succeed if you let them. You are certainly no pushover when it comes to a fight, so dig in your heels and refuse to give up what belongs only to you. ,scorpio,Some of the people you live and work with will show a distinct lack of support today – a few may even go out of their way to make life difficult for you. It’s no big deal, you’re capable of doing what needs to be done on your own.
scorpio,Whatever challenges come your way over the next few days you must think of them as opportunities to be exploited. That applies especially to your domestic situation. Good fortune is closely linked to how well you get along with loved ones. ,scorpio,You will be tough on certain people this weekend, and with good reason. The fact is they have been allowed to get away with too much in recent weeks and now you have no choice but to get a grip on the situation and bring them to heel. ,scorpio,What happens during the first half of the coming week will convince you that your most important objectives can only be reached if you meet others halfway. If you make an effort to do that then the second half of the week could be spectacular. ,scorpio,So many things are changing in your world now that it’s only natural you are a bit nervous. But don’t get so nervous that you freeze completely. A little bit of inner tension can be good, but too much can stifle your ability to think and act.
scorpio,It may annoy you that certain people are being so evasive but does it really matter? The planets urge you to forget about what other people might think and listen to your own thoughts for a change. You already know what needs to be done.
scorpio,The next 24 hours will be challenging, so promise yourself now that you won’t lose your cool. You will impress people more if you stay calm and refuse to react to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. And you can still plot your revenge in secret!,scorpio,You may be tempted to start something new today but before you do you should ask yourself if this is really the right time for it. Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means it might be wiser to finish what you have already started.
scorpio,You may be feeling low at the moment but that’s okay. Everyone goes through mood swings and it won’t be long before you are smiling again. Don’t try to force yourself to be happy because your subconscious will rebel and make you feel even worse.
scorpio,What happens today and tomorrow will go a long way toward restoring your peace of mind, especially if you have been worrying about money. Hopefully you will come to the conclusion that your financial problems are not as serious as you thought.
scorpio,You may do something silly this week but it’s unlikely that anything bad will come of it. The best way to deal with embarrassing situations is to laugh at yourself, because when all is said and done nothing is worth losing sleep or friends over.
scorpio,Something that used to worry you a lot will worry you less now. However, where money matters are concerned you must still be careful. The line between having enough and having nothing at all is not as wide as you seem to imagine.
sagittarius,Think seriously about starting something new this week, something different to what you are used to. Tuesday’s new moon will inspire you to make the kind of courageous choices most people prefer to avoid. But you’re not most people!,sagittarius,If you ask for something today you will most likely get it. But will it be good for you? The planets warn it might be smart to stick with what you already have and try to make the best of it. More is not necessarily better.
sagittarius,As the new moon takes place in your birth sign it is essential that you choose one aim and stick with it. This can be and should be one of the most successful times of the year but don’t scatter your energies in a dozen directions.
sagittarius,If a tough decision is called for then you must make it and live with the consequences. The planets warn that the worst possible thing you can do right now is to hedge your bets – come down on one side of the fence or the other.
sagittarius,If you are not doing so already you should be making big plans – no, make that huge plans. Cosmic activity in your birth sign indicates that the more things you start the more you will accomplish and the more fun you will have. ,sagittarius,You may not be the best in certain areas but in one particular field of endeavor you have no equals and that is what you should be focusing on now. Don’t try to be all things to all men, just be yourself – it’s more than enough.
sagittarius,There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. That applies to all areas of your life but particularly to friendships and social activities. What will be will be, so buy your ticket and enjoy the ride.
sagittarius,Make an effort to avoid all thoughts and feelings of doom and gloom. The Sun in your sign links with your ruler Jupiter this week but the effect could be to exaggerate what’s wrong with the world. It’s still a wonderful place. ,sagittarius,Some of the people you have to deal with today will drag their feet and find excuses why they cannot deliver what you require. You can lose your temper if you want but why raise your blood pressure? It will all come right with time.
sagittarius,Your mind may be bubbling with a dozen great ideas but if you try to follow them all you will get nowhere fast. Decide what is the one aim that means the most to you then put your heart and soul into it. One masterpiece at a time!,sagittarius,Make the most of the Sun in your sign to show the world what you are capable of. It’s never too late to make an impression or to move up in the world but there are times when it is easier than others and this is one of them.
sagittarius,Don’t take anything too seriously today because if you do you may get depressed and start wondering why you bother to make an effort. Everyone gets moods like this occasionally. Snap out of it by focusing on things that make you smile.
sagittarius,Why is it that people are so demanding of you? Most likely it’s because they know you are too nice to say “no”. At some stage today you need to get tough and let certain people know they have to do more for themselves from now on.
sagittarius,If you can meet others halfway and work together on things that are of mutual importance there is no limit to what you can achieve over the next few days. Remember: what you do for others you also do for yourself.
sagittarius,It’s time to take stock of what certain partnerships and relationships mean to you – and if you realize they don’t mean that much then maybe it’s time to bring them to an end. You cannot allow anyone to hold you back.
sagittarius,Teamwork is essential over the coming 12 months, even if – especially if – you are the sort of Sag who likes to go it alone. Co-operation was, is and always will be the key to success and that applies as much to personal affairs as it does to your career.
sagittarius,A full moon on your birthday means you need to pay more attention to partnerships over the next 12 months. That does not mean you have to give in every time there is a dispute of some kind but life will be easier if you let the other person win occasionally.
sagittarius,There will be a setback concerning a money matter or business deal and you won’t be happy about it. But is it worth getting worked up about? Life is full of uncertainties but very few mean much in the greater scheme of things.
sagittarius,The Sun remains in your sign only until Saturday, so get busy and get as much done as you can between now and then. That does not mean you won’t be able to get things done after that but it may not be so easy as it is now.
sagittarius,You appear to be having second thoughts about a plan that previously you thought was the key to success. Maybe you are right to hesitate but at some stage you are going to have to make a choice and stick with it. Stop dithering!,sagittarius,As the Sun leaves your sign today the emphasis of your affairs will start changing too, most noticeably in the way you deal with money. You may not have worried too much about cash flow before but you certainly need to now.
sagittarius,Looking back on the past few weeks you will be amazed how much time you wasted on things that don’t really matter. On the other hand you did have a great deal of fun, so there is no need to feel guilty. Fun is an essential part of life.
sagittarius,You know what needs to be done and you know that you must do it now, before anything else, so why are you hesitating? Push any doubts you may have to the back of your mind. As always, there is nothing to fear but fear itself.
sagittarius,Money matters must come first today and with Mercury joining the Sun in the main financial area of your chart you will get the chance to balance the books. Over the longer term, try not to waste your cash on things you don’t really need.
sagittarius,Plenty of people seem to be giving you advice at the moment but if you are wise you will disregard every last word of it. Only you know what you need, so only you are qualified to give guidance. Do what your inner voice tells you.
sagittarius,You may come into money over the next few days but it would be wrong to count on it to get you out of trouble. The only way you are going to improve your financial situation is to cut back on your commitments – starting today.
sagittarius,Your ability to resist temptation will be limited today, if it exists at all. But that’s okay because you need to let yourself go and have fun in that all-or-nothing Sagittarius way of yours. If it bucks up your spirits then it has to be good.
sagittarius,The cosmic picture is slowly but surely moving in your favor and what happens this weekend will convince you that your luck is on the turn. It could have turned earlier but your negative attitude held you back. Don’t let that happen again.
sagittarius,Anything of a financial or business nature will go well for you over the next few days – which makes a change. On the other hand, don’t start counting your profits or winnings before you actually have them in hand. That’s asking for trouble.
sagittarius,Money matters may be causing you sleepless nights but there is really little to worry about. The approaching new moon will show you a simple way out of your predicament but you may not see it if your mind is clouded with fear.
sagittarius,You may be on a roll and you may think you can do no wrong, but do you really want to risk it? According to the planets, if you bet big today you could win big; but you could lose big, too, so think carefully before making your choice. ,sagittarius,Go with the flow and let events work themselves out as they will. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to family and financial issues where, if you worry, you will only make matters worse. Tomorrow will take care of itself.
sagittarius,Others may say you are aiming too high but you know that you have to aim high to increase your chances of hitting a worthwhile target. Sagittarius is known as the sign of the Archer, so grab your bow and do some hunting today.
sagittarius,Whatever you decide over the next two or three days will — in some way or other — have a major effect on your future, so think ahead and make sure you are embarking on a course that is right for you. Don’t listen to others, listen to yourself.
sagittarius,It may appear as if you are losing something of value, but in fact you are making room for something that is worth even more. The planets urge you to think ahead and focus on where you will be both a year and five years from now.
sagittarius,If you need to approach someone for help with a business matter do so immediately. The planets indicate that if you make your pitch this week you stand a very good chance of getting what you ask for, so long as it isn’t too outrageous.
sagittarius,There may have been some confusion of late but you should find it easy to set the record straight today. If your remarks have been misquoted or taken out of context make sure everyone knows it. Shout about it if you have to.
sagittarius,You can make a little go a long way today, emotionally as well as financially. The trick is to not give too much away, to keep a little something in reserve and keep others guessing as to what you intend to do with it. ,sagittarius,Most times your hunches are spot on but the planets warn your instincts are not to be trusted today, so take care. This is one of those occasions when you must stick rigidly to the facts – and even they should be double checked.
sagittarius,Don’t stay indoors and hide yourself away – get out into the world and show everyone what star quality looks like. You were born to put on a show, to be larger than life, so why are you peeking out from behind the curtains?,sagittarius,Be positive about what happens today. Look on the bright side and realize that negativity of any kind will only add to your problems. Most of the world’s population would give their right arm to be you, so life can’t be that bad.
sagittarius,Be careful who you criticize this week because the full moon warns you could offend someone who has the power to make things difficult for you. You may be right in what you say but they won’t care in the slightest about that.
sagittarius,Something will happen over the next 24 hours that makes you feel a lot better about your long-term prospects. It will also make you realize that wealth, like so many other things in life, is as much a state of mind as anything else.
sagittarius,You may spend too much over the next few days but if you spend it mainly on other people it won’t be so bad. You are a generous soul at heart and like to see friends and family enjoy themselves. Don’t bankrupt yourself though.
sagittarius,Tomorrow’s full moon makes it likely that you will clash with someone over money and possessions. But don’t take the situation too seriously because in a matter of days neither of you will be able to remember what it was all about.
sagittarius,Your words will carry more weight if you keep what you have to say short and to the point. Don’t bother with explanations or clarifications, just say what you mean and leave no one in any doubt that you mean what you say. Less means more.
sagittarius,Someone you meet today will open your eyes to new possibilities. But that does not mean you should drop what you are doing and head off in a new direction. Wait for the Sun to change signs on Monday before making decisions.
sagittarius,Try not to attach so much importance to material things. Try not to get hung up on the fact that more cash seems to be going out than is coming in. This is only a temporary phase and is already coming to an end, so cheer up.
sagittarius,As from Monday, when the Sun changes signs, you will find it so much easier to let partners and loved ones know how you feel. In fact all you ever have to do is be open and honest about who you are and what it is you desire.
sagittarius,The pace of life is going to hot up over the next few days and you will have a lot of fun seeing how fast and how far you can go. But don’t go so fast and so far that you risk having an accident. Pace yourself sensibly.
sagittarius,Get out and about. Be sociable. Wherever you go and whatever you do you will have a lot of fun and even the most ordinary of encounters will be hugely enjoyable. Make the effort to talk to people – you may learn something worth knowing.
sagittarius,Be honest. Let others know what they are doing is wrong and what they must do to put it right. Most importantly, don’t allow yourself to worry that you might bruise their sensitive egos. Honesty is the best policy even if it hurts.
sagittarius,The only reason someone is being so critical is because they resent your success. Perhaps you should point out to them that if they worked as hard as you they might be successful too. On the other hand, why waste your breath?,sagittarius,Don’t take it personally if a friend is overly critical. They are probably more annoyed with themselves than they are with you but their ego won’t let them admit it. It’s not worth fighting about. They’ll make it up to you tomorrow.
sagittarius,It could be that you feel a bit worn down and discouraged. If so you need to get a grip on yourself because the planets warn if you give up on something now you will only have to start it again later. Dig deep and carry on.
sagittarius,Let everyone around you, at home and at work, know what you think and how you feel and they will go out of their way to meet your needs and make you happy. Misunderstandings will only arise if you expect people to read your mind.
sagittarius,Your main task over the next few days is to find ways to fulfill your obligations, both at home and at work, while still having fun socially. For best results, steer clear of extremes and steer clear of people who bring out the worst in you.
sagittarius,The Sun in Aquarius makes you more outgoing and sociable than usual and that’s good because other aspects indicate that someone interesting is coming your way. Don’t look away and pretend you don’t see them – let them catch your eye.
sagittarius,Why are you not getting what you want out of life? If you are honest, you will have to admit it is because you are spending too much time on things of minor importance. Devote yourself to making the most of your talents.
sagittarius,You should be feeling a lot more relaxed about life now and today’s new moon will put you in the mood to go out and have fun with your friends. Partnerships and relationships will make you happier than you ever thought possible.
sagittarius,You know what needs to be done to put things right and put loved ones and business colleagues at their ease – so do it. Just make sure you can deliver on any promises you might make – and never, ever make promises about money.
sagittarius,You may be tempted to give up on something, or someone, that is causing you grief but the planets warn that would be a mistake. The situation will improve unexpectedly early next week, so stick with it. Since when have you been a quitter?,sagittarius,You can turn dreams into realities this week – no, really. All you have to do is be yourself and believe in yourself. The latter is important as various people will try to convince you that you don’t stand a chance. They’re wrong.
sagittarius,According to the planets someone you work or do business with is not being entirely straight with you. Before you go any further together in what you are working on demand to know where they are coming from – and going to.
sagittarius,You need to talk through issues that have been making life difficult for you and your loved ones. Someone needs to take the lead, and according to the planets, that someone will have to be you. No one else is brave enough. ,sagittarius,Try not to let your impatience get the better of you today. With mind planet Mercury beginning one of its retrograde phases there is simply no point rushing to get things done. In the greater scheme of things they’re really not that important.
sagittarius,Change is good, change is positive, so whatever else you do today don’t fight the changes that come your way. You were not designed by the cosmos to stay where you are – you were designed to explore and try out new things.
sagittarius,You should find it easy to talk to partners and colleagues this weekend: You will be on just the right wavelength and know just the right things to say. Help loved ones and friends to feel good about themselves — and you’ll feel good too.
sagittarius,Put feelings of regret and remorse behind you and act as if life has never been better. Even a livewire Sag gets a bit down now and again but you bounce back faster than most. Remember: what makes life worth living is loving and laughing.
sagittarius,This should be an encouraging time for you as your money worries fade and your ability to enjoy the simple things in life returns. One sad person may try to bring you down with their tales of woe, but you don’t have to listen. ,sagittarius,Family ties must come first. Put petty arguments behind you and move forward together again. Cosmic activity in the domestic sector of your chart makes it easy to kiss and make up today – but from tomorrow it may be too late.
sagittarius,You will get more done if you take a gentler approach to partnership matters. Put yourself in others’ shoes and imagine how you would feel if someone talked to you the way you sometimes talk to them. You can be a bit abrupt at times.
sagittarius,If you do things for others that they should be doing for themselves it won’t be long before they expect you to do it all. You need to be tough today. You need to let others know that they need to take more responsibility for themselves.
sagittarius,You have freedom to move in whatever direction takes your fancy, but don’t forget you also have responsibilities and that certain people are depending on you in various ways. Take them with you on your whirlwind journey. Brighten their weekend.
sagittarius,The most important thing now is that you assert your independence. If you allow others to order you around they will get the impression that you are weak and will make your life a misery every chance they get. Don’t let that happen.
sagittarius,Someone will surprise you today with what amounts to an outrageous ultimatum. Surprise them back by telling them in no uncertain language what they can do with their demands. Refuse to be intimidated. Eventually they will back down.
sagittarius,You must control your temper today, no matter how extreme the provocation may be. That may be easier said than done, but it must be done or what starts as a minor dispute could quickly get out of hand. Avoid people who like to fight. ,sagittarius,As the Sun is now moving through the domestic area of your chart it will pay you to focus more on family members than on yourself or your work. What can you do to make them happy? How can you let them know they are loved?,sagittarius,Either you will change your mind and annoy other people, or they will change their minds and annoy you. Either way tempers are going to be a bit on the short side over the next 24 hours. Try not to say anything too emotionally damaging.
sagittarius,You may be reluctant to cross swords with a rival but at some stage you are going to have to face them. It’s better you should do so now, while the omens are good for a peaceful solution, than later when you’re both fired up for a fight.
sagittarius,Loved ones and work colleagues will forgive you almost anything this week, so you may as well make the most of it. However, you will be forgiven just the once, so if you are going to get caught at least make sure the sin is worth it!,sagittarius,Try to be more open with partners and loved ones as the new week begins. If you make the effort you will quite easily find the words that have been lacking these past few weeks – words that heal rifts that are no more than misunderstandings.
sagittarius,If a loved one demands more independence you must give it to them. You should know by now that the harder you try to control other people the more it hurts when they finally break away. You’re their friend, not their jailer.
sagittarius,If you need assistance then you must speak up. You have helped others out so many times in the past that they will go out of their way to help you in return, but they can’t do that unless they know you are hurting. Tell them.
sagittarius,You don’t have to rely on other people. You are perfectly equipped to go it alone if that is what you desire. You have high hopes for the future and will make quicker progress if you don’t have to worry about dragging others along behind you.
sagittarius,Now that Mercury, planet of communication, is moving in your favor again you will find it much easier to express yourself. But don’t let everyone know what is going on in that big brain of yours. Never forget that knowledge is power.
sagittarius,Loved ones and relatives may have been difficult to handle in recent weeks but only because you were not approaching them in the right way. Now that you understand their fears a bit better you can find ways to get through to them.
sagittarius,Hard work never hurt anyone, or so they say, but that does not mean you have to work yourself into the ground every minute of every day. This week’s influences will offer you the chance to take a well-earned break. Don’t be a fool and turn it down.
sagittarius,Some things are more difficult than others but this will be one of those days when everything comes easy to you. With the Sun linked to Pluto, planet of power, there is nothing you cannot do. So ask yourself: what is it you WANT to do?,sagittarius,The situation you have to deal with today is of a kind you would prefer to avoid, but once you get stuck into it you will find it provides the kind of challenges that require brain power to resolve – and that’s the kind you enjoy.
sagittarius,You can get through twice as much work in half as much time as you usually do today, but don’t spend all your time on everyday chores because this is also an aspect that increases the fun factor of your life. You remember fun, don’t you?,sagittarius,Some people seem to be under the impression that they can snap their fingers and you will come running but with Jupiter, your ruler, on great form today they are in for a rude awakening. If anyone is going to be imperious it is going to be you.
sagittarius,Someone will offer what sounds like good advice today but the planets warn they are more likely to be thinking of their interests rather than yours. You don’t have to be told what to do. Listen to your inner voice – it knows what you need.
sagittarius,You seem to be getting bogged down in trivia, so stand back from what you are doing and try to see it from a wider viewpoint. Once you realize how unimportant it all is you won’t feel in the least bit bad about ditching it.
sagittarius,Don’t waste time worrying about the things that you have done or about the things that you still have to do. You are more likely to enjoy the week ahead if you take life as it comes and react to events rather than try to incite them.
sagittarius,Doors that have been closed to you in the past will start to open over the next few days but for some reason you may decide not to walk through. Even if you cannot explain your reluctance listen to what your inner voice tells you.
sagittarius,You are where you are for a reason, so don’t start complaining that you would rather be some place else. No matter what occurs over the next 24 hours, be it “good” or be it “bad”, you can be sure it will benefit you in the long-term.
sagittarius,You have no doubts and no fears and no reason to believe you will not succeed at the tasks you have set yourself. Rivals on the work front may try to derail your plans over the next few days but they won’t come close to succeeding.
sagittarius,Don’t waste time lamenting what might have been. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, which among other things means you should always be looking forward to the next big adventure. Yesterday is over and done with. It’s time to move on.
sagittarius,You have so many options available to you now that it may be hard to know where to start. For best results you should spend as much time as possible in social situations. New people you meet will bring new career and romantic opportunities.
sagittarius,Dealings with employers and other important people could be a bit touch and go over the next couple of days. Was it something you said? Remember, what sounds like a good joke to you could be taken as a personal insult by others.
sagittarius,Before you agree to get involved in a project of some kind make sure you know what you are letting yourself in for. You need to be thinking along similar lines to your new partners and colleagues. If you’re not, give it a miss.
sagittarius,Mercury, planet of communication, moves into the domestic area of your chart today, so an exchange of ideas, and feelings, with partners and loved ones will be of benefit to you all. The more you talk the more you will understand one another.
sagittarius,If there is something you want to tell the world, something you think it should know, shout about it as loudly as you can. You’ve always had an outsize ego and now you have an outsize voice to go with it. Make sure you get heard.
sagittarius,No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been your affairs will improve dramatically as from tomorrow, so cheer up and stop acting as if the world is about to come to an end. That kind of apocalyptic nonsense is beneath your intelligence.
sagittarius,You don’t lack for confidence, do you? The Sun’s move into your fellow Fire sign of Aries endows you with the kind of self-belief that moves mountains. There is a world out there waiting to be impressed by your brilliance. Get to it!,sagittarius,Refuse to lower your standards or do anything you consider to be underhand or unfair. Others may enjoy cutting corners and breaking rules but you know that in the long-term negative behaviour has a way of coming back at you.
sagittarius,There is always something new to learn and Mercury, planet of the mind, will teach you something worth knowing over the next 48 hours. It will also remind you that the most important thing of all is to be at peace with yourself.
sagittarius,Nothing much will trouble you this week and that’s a good thing because nothing much is worth getting worked up about. Recent events have reminded you that getting involved and choosing sides very often makes things worse than they were before.
sagittarius,You will see someone you thought of as a rival in a new light today – they are in fact one of the best friends you’ve got. Like all best friends they may sometimes tell you things you don’t want to hear – but it’s for your own good.
sagittarius,The planets warn that you may have to end friendships and associations that no longer meet your needs. Once you have done that there will be room in your life to start new ones with people whose views are more in line with your own.
sagittarius,Today’s Mercury-Jupiter aspect will help you find the words to connect with those you are closest to. You don’t have to get emotional about it but you do have to remind them that your love was, is and always will be unconditional.
sagittarius,It’s not like you to withdraw into your shell but you may do so over the next 24 hours. That’s okay. You have important issues to decide on and you won’t think straight if there is too much noise going on around you. Take some time out.
sagittarius,You may be a rebel by nature but this is not a good time to rock the boat. Instead, find out what assistance friends and family members need and do what you can to help them realize their goals. In short, be positive rather than negative.
sagittarius,A little charm will go a long way over the next 48 hours. Your way with words, your sense of humor and your winning smile will help persuade almost anyone to do almost anything for you. Does that get your thoughts racing? It should!,sagittarius,It’s quite possible you will bite off more than you can chew this week, most likely around the time the Sun links with Jupiter, your ruler, on Tuesday. Now that you know that you can respect your own limits and stay within them, can’t you? ,sagittarius,There is something that needs to be done as a matter of urgency. The longer you leave it the more you will have to rush things when you do eventually get started and that could lead to mistakes. Draw up a “to do” list and stick to it.
sagittarius,You may hear something about your money situation that brings a smile to your face today but don’t be too hasty. The planets warn there is a chance you are being misled, so don’t go on a spending spree on the strength of a promise.
sagittarius,If you think you are being cheated on something you must speak up. It may be that you have got the wrong end of the stick and there is nothing amiss, but until you know that for sure you cannot afford to take chances.
sagittarius,A new business venture can be a success but to make it work you will need to give everything to it. Is it worth the time and energy? Only you can decide and the planets indicate you will have to make that decision very soon.
sagittarius,Don’t let people play on your feelings and get you to do things you might not choose to do if you were thinking logically. At some point you need to get tough and let them know you are no longer prepared to play this game.
sagittarius,You will be unable to resist a cry for help this weekend, even though you are far from sure it is genuine. It’s not whether someone deserves your help that matters but that you are prepared to give it from the goodness of your heart.
sagittarius,Raise your sights this week and believe that you can create something magnificent. Others may try to persuade you that you are aiming too high but that simply isn’t true. The universe indicates there are no limits, at least not for you.
sagittarius,Don’t worry if you are not feeling on top of the world at the moment because with mind planet Mercury joining the Sun in the most dynamic area of your chart it’s just a matter of time before your mood improves. There, see, you’re smiling already.
sagittarius,Try to get out and about today. The planets indicate that the more you are on the move the more likely it is you will meet new people and learn new things – and knowledge, as you are well aware, is the basis of real power.
sagittarius,The more certain people say you have taken on too much the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Sagittarius is the sort of sign that likes to do things in a big way – it’s in your nature to put on a show. Go for it.
sagittarius,You have a tendency to say things you don’t really believe simply because you enjoy seeing the looks of shock on other people’s faces. It may be a lot of fun but it could backfire on you today. Try laughing with people, not just at them.
sagittarius,You may be on top of your game at the moment but a week or so from now your energy may dip a bit, so don’t make too many plans and certainly don’t take on any more chores. If anything you need a rest, not more work.
sagittarius,If you make a mistake this weekend – and according to the planets you most likely will – no harm will come of it so long as you remedy the situation as quickly as possible. If you have to say “sorry” make sure your apology sounds genuine.
sagittarius,If others want to fight over petty differences then let them – it has nothing to do with you. Make the most of the Sun’s last few days in the most dynamic area of your chart to bring a creative project to a successful conclusion.
sagittarius,There will be times over the next two or three days when you seem out of your depth but that is not an excuse to give up. If you do you will most likely regret it as the planets bring new self-belief and new opportunities.
sagittarius,Don’t think too hard about something that appears wholly illogical – it will only scramble your brains even more than they are scrambled already! A number of strange, even bizarre, things are likely to happen but none of them can do you harm.
sagittarius,You can succeed and you will succeed but you will succeed a lot quicker if you get help from people who share your ambitions. Teamwork is the way to move forward and that, of course, means compromise. You know you can do it!,sagittarius,If you own up to some sort of transgression today it may surprise you how little others seem to care about it. Either it’s not such a big deal after all or their own sins are many times worse. Either way, for you it’s a win.
sagittarius,Stand back from your everyday cares and see life from a wider perspective. It may be easy to believe that the odds are stacked against you, that nothing will ever go right again, but that’s an illusion brought about by too narrow a focus.
sagittarius,Wave goodbye to wishful thinking and focus on the realities of your present situation. That does not mean your dreams should be abandoned but you do need to get serious about which of them have potential and which are just pie in the sky.
sagittarius,You may be asked to take on more chores and responsibilities now that the Sun is moving through the area of your chart that governs your everyday workload. By all means do what you can but don’t try to do everything – you’re not Superman.
sagittarius,You are entitled to your opinions but you are not entitled to expect that other people will agree with you. So long as you’re okay with that nothing much will go wrong but if you cannot accept alternative viewpoints it could be a difficult day.
sagittarius,There may be an element of risk in what you are planning but you know if you don’t go ahead with it you will hate yourself for being so timid. Prepare as well as you can then jump right in and pray it goes according to plan!,sagittarius,While everyone else is running around and bumping into each other as if the end of the world is nigh you will be the picture of tranquility. That may mean you actually have no idea what is going on but there are times when ignorance is no bad thing.
sagittarius,The cosmic picture is so good at the moment that most people will respond positively if you approach them the right way – as equals and partners. On the work front especially if you smile and ask nicely you’ll get everything you need.
sagittarius,If you have been too busy to spend much quality time with loved ones recently you will get the chance to make up for it over the next few days. You’ve had your fun, now you want those you have feelings for to have fun as well.
sagittarius,A job worth doing is a job worth doing well, so knuckle down and make sure no one has any reason to question the quality of the finished product. Whether you work with your head or your hands you’ll make a huge impression this weekend.
sagittarius,Limit yourself to one or two major tasks rather than the half dozen or so you were planning. Quality is always more important than quantity, so be selective and let others see you take pride in what you do – then they’ll pay you more for it.
sagittarius,Because you like to be independent you may not enjoy what takes place over the next 24 hours. You may have to fight for your right to set your own agenda and come and go as you please, but it’s a fight worth having – and winning.
sagittarius,You may find it hard to be patient today but stay in control and don’t let your temper get the better of you. The planets warn if you get annoyed you could do yourself harm. At this time of year your health is especially important.
sagittarius,Don’t worry too much if you get behind in your work because there will be plenty of time to catch up later on. It would help, of course, if you were not so willing to take on other people’s tasks. You can be too generous you know.
sagittarius,Try to say only nice things about friends and colleagues, because if you make your true feelings known it will cause you all sorts of problems. That applies doubly on the work front, no matter how much you may despise certain people.
sagittarius,You will no doubt be annoyed if something holds you back today but later on you will thank your lucky stars that you were forced to stay where you are. If fate conspires to keep you from doing something there must be a reason.
sagittarius,Cosmic activity in the work and wellbeing area of your chart will make the next few days interesting to say the least. But don’t think you have to change things to keep up with the times. As of now the times can keep up with you.
sagittarius,You will get an opportunity to put your point of view a crossover the next few days, so know what it is you want to say then say it with total self confidence. It would help, of course, if your point of view is right as well.
sagittarius,It’s not like you to put practical matters above having fun but you may have no choice in the matter over the next 24 hours. Social activities will have to take second place to getting on top of your work and money situations – for now.
sagittarius,If others won’t give you what you deserve then you will just have to take it for yourself. You have worked long and hard to reach your current position and have no intention of letting others take the glory, or the money.
sagittarius,Life is not a zero sum game – other people don’t have to lose out just so that you can win. Your task today is to find creative ways in which to further your own ambitions while helping others to get what they need as well.
sagittarius,Don’t think badly of yourself if you have to admit that you have failed to reach a target of some sort. The fact is you tried – when so many other people never even get started – and that alone makes you some kind of hero.
sagittarius,You will be caught out by something you did not expect today. The simple fact is you have taken certain things for granted when you had no reason to do so. Admit you made a mistake and do what you can to put it right.
sagittarius,It is essential that you strive to get along with friends and co-workers this weekend because that is the only way you are going to get anything done. Also, if someone goes out of their way to annoy you just ignore them. It’s a test.
sagittarius,You will get support from some unlikely sources over the next few days. People will rally round and make life easier for you. You will get the chance to repay their generosity over the next few weeks go out of your way to do so.
sagittarius,Try not to come on too strong when debating with other people. You may have all the best opinions and the facts and figures are certainly on your side but make allowances for those who don’t share your passion for the truth.
sagittarius,If you need to make changes in your working environment now is the time. The approaching full moon warns that some of your colleagues won’t like what you do but that’s too bad. Either they fit in with your plans or they move out.
sagittarius,You are who you are for a reason, so don’t let anyone get away with telling you that you should think or act in ways that don’t feel right to you. Fortunately, there is something obstinate in your nature that refuses to compromise.
sagittarius,You seem a lot more relaxed about life in general and affairs of the heart in particular now and that’s good. You also seem a lot less concerned with what other people think about what you are doing. If it feels right to you, carry on!,sagittarius,You need to make some kind of change to your everyday routine and you need to make it immediately. Astrology is all about time and timing and the time to get started is now, while both your motivation and energy are high.
sagittarius,Others will happily heap more work on your shoulders this weekend, but only because they know you won’t complain. Maybe it’s time to get tough and let them know that, starting right now, you will work for no-one but yourself.
sagittarius,Try not to be too assertive or aggressive. With the Sun moving into your opposite sign this week the best way to get things done – and maybe the only way – is to cooperate with like-minded people. The rewards are big enough to share around.
sagittarius,The more others sing your praises today the more suspicious you should be. Don’t be taken in by their sweet talk. The fact is they are after something you possess and will say anything to get you to part with it. You’re not that stupid, are you?,sagittarius,It’s good that you support some kind of cause but don’t fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to use underhand methods to further your aims. Despite what some fools say the ends do not justify the means, not now, not ever.
sagittarius,Find ways to get along with people who rub you up the wrong way. Like it or not you are going to have to work closely with various individuals over the next few weeks, so forget about your differences. Focus on what you have in common.
sagittarius,You have been asking some searching questions of yourself of late and today you will discover that the answers you seek are not to be found in your career or in making more money. Listen to your inner voice. It knows what you need.
sagittarius,Now that the Sun has moved into the partnership area of your chart you will have to take what other people think and see and need into account more than you usually do. Together you can do great things but your aims must be compatible.
sagittarius,Why have you let your fears get the better of you? There is no logical reason why you should be so afraid – none whatsoever – so realize that your fears are all in the mind then cleanse your mind of any and all negative thoughts. Do it now.
sagittarius,Partners and colleagues and loved ones will do almost anything for you over the next few days – all you have to do is ask. Don’t worry that you may be wasting their time because they don’t see it that way. They want to be nice to you.
sagittarius,The most important thing over the next few days is that you don’t give anyone the authority to make decisions on your behalf. The message of the stars is that you must stay in control of your destiny – because everything else depends on that.
sagittarius,Anything of a one-to-one nature, be it personal, professional or financial, can be changed for the better over the next few days. Romance is especially well starred and one special person will make it feel as if all your birthdays have come at once.
sagittarius,It may be that your rivals have the advantage but what happens today and tomorrow will give you the courage, as well as the opportunity, to turn the tables on them. Believe you will win. The more confident you look the better you will do.
sagittarius,You may have lots of tasks to complete but now is not the time to get busy on them. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the wellbeing area of your chart today your best course of action is to take life easy and let good things happen.
sagittarius,By all means stand up for what you believe but don’t turn it into a war. Just because some people disagree with you does not mean you have to beat them into submission. It takes all sorts to make such an interesting world.
sagittarius,The world seems a sunnier and happier place now and with the Sun and Mars on your side this weekend just about everything will go right for you. Relationships and friendships are under excellent stars, so get out there and socialize.
sagittarius,Cooperation is the key to success. If you go it alone this week you won’t much enjoy where you end up – if, indeed, you end up anywhere at all. The more you work with other people the more all of you will gain. It’s win-win!,sagittarius,If there is something you want to sort out with a loved one then you need to be quick about it. Mercury, planet of communication, turns retrograde on the 7th, making it much harder to make a friendly connection. So speak up now.
sagittarius,It is important that you keep the momentum going today because if you slow down even a little bit your energy could tail off dramatically. Also, don’t attach too much importance to a relationship problem. It’s not as bad as it seems.
sagittarius,You may have certain duties to fulfill but that does not mean you have to do everything others expect of you. Make sure everyone knows that you answer to one boss only and that’s the person you see in the mirror each morning!,sagittarius,Things may get a bit bumpy over the next day or two but if you sit tight the turbulence will pass. If others want to throw tantrums and look silly that’s up to them – you are under no obligation to follow their example.
sagittarius,You should be making great progress now and if you are not it can only be a matter of time. Make an effort to move up in the world and make sure others can see that you are going places. Everyone loves a winner. Everyone loves you.
sagittarius,What seems such a trivial issue to you is of major importance to someone else, so make allowances. If you want some peace today it might be wise to make it look as if you share their concerns – even if you really could not care less.
sagittarius,Your grasp of the facts will leave something to be desired over the next few days, so steer clear of situations where you are expected to make decisions that other people are going to rely on. They won’t be happy if you get it wrong.
sagittarius,Little things will annoy you more than big things today and the more you tell yourself to stop being silly the more annoyed you will get. By this time tomorrow you will have calmed down but today you’ll need all your powers of self-control.
sagittarius,Something will occur over the next 48 hours that reminds you just how much there still is to learn. You may yearn for perfection but the simple fact is it’s never going to happen, so learn to be happy with who you are.
sagittarius,Even a Sagittarius gets it wrong now and again so don’t take it to heart if you have made some kind of mistake. And don’t try to cover it up either. You are always bold in your successes, so be bold in your failures too!,sagittarius,A lot of good things have been happening of late but tomorrow’s full moon in your sign will confront you with an issue that is unlikely to have a happy ending. Decide what is best for you personally, and for those you love, then act accordingly.
sagittarius,The full moon in your sign could see you acting out of character today and you may even make a bit of a fool of yourself. But what does it matter? It’s all good, clean fun and no one will think any the less of you for it.
sagittarius,Make sure others know who is in charge over the next 48 hours. You may not want to get heavy about it but certain people have been taking liberties and it has to stop. Make an example of one individual and everyone will get the message.
sagittarius,If your conscience is nagging at you to own up to something then now is the time to admit your guilt. You may be surprised how little others actually care. It’s all about timing and now is the best time to be honest.
sagittarius,You may be tempted to bring a partnership of some kind to a close but don’t be too hasty. The planets indicate there is life in it yet, so hang in there and find ways to make it work. Chances are you’ll be glad you did.
sagittarius,Your self-confidence could take a bit of a dive today, even though your circumstances have not changed at all. Everyone goes through a down phase once in a while, so don’t attach too much importance to it. You’ll come up smiling, as always.
sagittarius,The best way to avoid an unpleasant situation is to pretend it does not exist. You are not in the mood for confrontation and there is no cosmic law that says you have to face situations, or people, you would prefer to avoid. Be invisible.
sagittarius,It is important that you deal with an outstanding feud immediately because if you allow it to linger it will hold you back later and that could be disastrous. Look a bit harder for a compromise solution – it won’t be difficult to find.
sagittarius,The most important thing now is that you do not allow vague fears and forebodings to hold you back from what you are planning. Yes, there are a number of things that can go wrong but even if they do the consequences won’t be so bad.
sagittarius,Anything to do with your wealth – property and investments in particular – must be handled with care over the next few weeks. There is a lot to be won but also a lot to be lost, so think before you act and never let others take decisions for you.
sagittarius,It would appear that someone or something has affected you deeply and you are struggling hard to keep your emotions in check. But why? Everyone has feelings, even a Sagittarius, and it’s not healthy to keep them locked up inside.
sagittarius,Everyone seems to be singing your praises now but your number one priority should be helping someone else feel special. It seems that a loved one is feeling a bit neglected, so go out of your way to spend time with them.
sagittarius,You will get things done quicker today if you join forces with people who share your aims, ambitions, principles and beliefs. Also, tell the most special person in your life how much you adore them. They may need some reassurance.
sagittarius,You may have to twist a few arms to get what you want today but it won’t be too difficult, in fact you will enjoy playing the tough guy. Just make sure you only make life tough for your rivals and enemies – not your friends.
sagittarius,Use your energy wisely today because if you waste it on trivial things you could pay dearly for it tomorrow. Don’t listen to what others say is important, listen only to what your own inner voice tells you is important.
sagittarius,Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart may give you a rather negative view of life but it does not have to be that way. What happens over the next 24 hours will confirm that you are loved and admired.
sagittarius,It does not matter if other people approve of your aims – the only thing that matters is they mean something to you. Get on with your planning, then get on with doing what has to be done. You don’t need anyone’s permission to be yourself.
sagittarius,News that comes your way over the next few days may not be entirely to your liking but it is certainly what you need. Look on the bright side and look for ways you can turn events around so they work in your favor.
sagittarius,There are times when it is sensible to let other people take the lead and this is most certainly one of them. As from tomorrow, when Mercury moves in your favor again, you can seize the initiative and make things happen.
sagittarius,It may be tempting to lose yourself in the social whirl today but there are questions that need answering, questions that won’t go away just because you ignore them. You’ll find the answers you seek – IF you start looking now.
sagittarius,Stop looking at your problems in such an emotional manner. Your feelings must not be allowed to come into it, especially where money and business issues are concerned. Practical problems require practical solutions, so make sure you use your head.
sagittarius,Break a few rules and put a few noses out of joint today. The planets are urging you to do something out of the ordinary, something that stirs things up a bit in your quiet little corner of the world. Rock the boat and see who falls out!,sagittarius,This may be a difficult day for you but it can also be a day when you learn something to your advantage. If you are torn between the future and the past, choose the future. If you are torn between your friends and money, choose friends.
sagittarius,You need to come out from the shadows and remind those who may have forgotten who you are and what you can do. Believe in yourself and be ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Be a doer, not a doubter.
sagittarius,What others expect of you is irrelevant – the only thing that matters is what you expect of yourself. This will be one of those weeks when you must put your own interests first, even if it means other people lose out in some way.
sagittarius,You may think your charm will get you everything you desire, and you may be right, but that is not an excuse to bend rules or cut corners. Everything balances out in the end, so if you cheat others now you will pay for it later.
sagittarius,You are not the only one with good ideas, so listen to what friends and family members have to tell you over the next 24 hours and, if their advice sounds good, act on it immediately. Don’t let your ego get in the way.
sagittarius,Put yourself forward and prove to the doubters you have what it takes. You may have to get tough, especially when dealing with people who try to play down your achievements, but you’ll make a good impression on those who matter.
sagittarius,This should be a lucky day for you but a lot will depend on your own common sense, especially where money matters are concerned. Put your own interests first but be aware that your interests and other people’s interests are not far apart.
sagittarius,If you are feeling a bit tongue-tied at the moment you should take that as a sign that it’s not the right time to speak up. If you say too much today and over the weekend you may have to unsay it again in the very near future.
sagittarius,What you start this weekend could make you a considerable amount of money. If you are smart you will resist the urge to start a new project and instead redouble your efforts to finish the one you are on. That’s where the cash is.
sagittarius,Someone new will come into your life this week and before you know it you will be the best of friends. It’s even possible that, in time, you will become more than friends, but even if there is an attraction there don’t rush things.
sagittarius,Others may follow the old way of doing things but you are more adventurous than that. The planets encourage you to be inventive and original and if you are able to respond you will create something that will be praised far and wide.
sagittarius,Someone seems to believe that you are an easy touch and that they can get what they want by appealing to your generous nature. Are they in for a shock! It’s time to be a bit more miserly, both with your affections and your money.
sagittarius,The pace of life has been hectic of late and if you don’t take a break soon you might regret it. There is, though, still enough time for one last effort to complete something that means a lot to you. Get it finished today.
sagittarius,The next few days will bring some nice surprises. It’s not often you are this lucky or this popular so make the most of it and don’t start thinking there is some kind of catch, because there isn’t. Be positive and act positive too.
sagittarius,There is no need to rush and there is no need to impose deadlines on what you are doing. The more pressure you put on yourself the more likely it is you will make a mistake. Relax: everything will work out in the end.
sagittarius,Decide on a course of action and stick to it. The more you chop and change the more likely it is your efforts will fall short and leave you feeling as if you have wasted your time and your talents. Focus your energy in a single direction.
sagittarius,You should start feeling more like your old self over the next few days. With both the Sun and Jupiter, your ruler, transiting your fellow Fire sign of Leo you will have the confidence to try new things and visit new places. Have fun!,sagittarius,You must be totally committed to what it is you are working on. If you are reluctant to get fully involved other people may decide they can do without you altogether – which won’t do your ego or your bank balance much good.
sagittarius,The Sun’s change of signs today will broaden your horizons and make it easier for you to focus on the good things in life rather than the bad. Also, ideas that never meant much to you before will become a lot more important.
sagittarius,The only danger now is that with so many marvelous things going on in your life you could let down your guard and let other people make decisions that are profitable for them but costly for you. Stay alert at all times.
sagittarius,Confidence will not be in short supply over the next few days but what about common sense? The good news is you seem to have learnt how to set goals and pace yourself sensibly. You’ll go far. In fact you’ll go all the way.
sagittarius,Others will go out of their way to pick holes in your arguments over the next 24 hours and you must go out of your way to ignore them. Having said that, there may be something you have overlooked, so be aware of other possibilities.
sagittarius,If you feel strongly about something then act on it. Yes, it may make you unpopular in certain circles but that’s not important. What matters is that you can look in the mirror in the morning and like what you see. Principles matter.
sagittarius,You need to question your attitude to your working routine and the effects it has been having on your health. Not even a Sagittarius can keep up the same frenetic pace day after day. Ask yourself: what can you do to slow things down a bit?,sagittarius,Don’t just believe what other people tell you – go out into the world and experience it for yourself. Chances are you will discover that a lot of what you were told was nonsense. The only face you can trust is the one that stares back from the mirror.
sagittarius,What can you do to make someone’s life more exciting and fulfilling? Time spent helping others will not be time wasted and your kind words and good deeds will have a ripple effect, making you a force for positive change.
sagittarius,Be open to alternative viewpoints. The world is changing faster than ever and those who don’t try to keep up will get left behind quicker than they anticipated, so be alert to what is going on around you and be ready to move with the times.
sagittarius,Others can do stupid things and waste their money if they wish but you have people depending on you and that means you must stay calm and stay focused on what is important. You’re a lot more responsible than most people appreciate.
sagittarius,The upsets and restrictions of the past few months are beginning to fade and all you should care about today and over the weekend is having as much fun as possible. This is one of the best times of the year for you – so enjoy it.
sagittarius,Today’s link between Mercury, planet of communication, and Jupiter, your ruler, will help you to reach out to people who share your passion and your principles. Together you will achieve something that makes the world sit up and take notice.
sagittarius,Don’t start complaining that nothing seems to be going right for you at the moment because over the next seven days your fortunes will turn dramatically. The Sun is very much on your side at the moment, so show your positive side too.
sagittarius,By all means be aware of other people’s doubts but don’t let them worry you. If you take everyone’s misgivings into account you won’t get much done. The important thing is that you have confidence in yourself. It’s really all you need.
sagittarius,With the Sun, Mercury and Jupiter all moving through one of the most positive areas of your chart at the moment you can and you must do something out of the ordinary. Whatever you do it will be a huge success, so what are you waiting for?,sagittarius,What happens around the time of the full moon at the weekend will turn everything upside-down, so there is no point taking anything too seriously. Go where there is laughter and fun and ignore those who say you are being irresponsible.
sagittarius,Nothing is impossible. Some things, of course, may be more difficult and take more time than others but you can still find a way to realize your dreams. You will realize them quicker if you learn from those who have been there and done it already.
sagittarius,No matter how busy you may be at the moment you won’t be satisfied until you have booked a vacation or promised friends that you will visit them over the weekend. Travel brings out the best in you. All work and no play just isn’t healthy.
sagittarius,There is no need to be cautious. There is no need to hold back. On the contrary, this is the perfect time to take chances and make changes. There may be occasions when you push your luck too far but no harm will come of it.
sagittarius,If you try to please all of the people all of the time you will end up pleasing no one, so you might as well just please yourself. This is one of those days when your generosity will be taken for granted, so don’t waste it.
sagittarius,Life is good and getting better by the minute. Cosmic activity in your fellow Fire sign of Leo means more things will go right than go wrong over the next few days, so stop worrying, start smiling and make fun things happen.
sagittarius,Generally your instincts are spot on but over the course of the next 24 hours you will have to admit that your negative views about a newcomer to your social circle were totally wrong. It seems they are a lot nicer than you thought.
sagittarius,Some kind of crisis has almost reached breaking point and what happens today and tomorrow will finally take it over the top. If a relationship is on the slide don’t waste time trying to save it – the planets say it’s time to move on.
sagittarius,No matter how eager you may be to get started on a new project you need to take time out and get your head around all the changes that are taking place in your world. Some serious thinking now will save time and energy later on.
sagittarius,Mercury’s move into the career area of your chart makes this the ideal time to think about your ambitions. Is what you are doing now what you want to be doing long-term? If not, start planning some changes – and make them big.
sagittarius,Honesty is the best policy but you may have to tell a small lie this weekend to save a friend from making a big mistake. If it’s the only way to make sure they stay out of trouble then go ahead, but don’t make a habit of it.
sagittarius,Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good and that could be a problem this week. If you want to help people in need do so through a charitable organization – and make sure you know how your cash is being spent.
sagittarius,Think only positive thoughts and only positive things will happen. Yes, it really is that easy. Create something out of the ordinary today by focusing your mind in a single direction. Extraordinary, even outrageous, things will start to occur very soon.
sagittarius,These are exciting times for you but there is a danger you could burn yourself out, especially if you focus all your energy in a single direction. Big and beneficial changes are coming, so you need to stay sharp and stay fresh.
sagittarius,The planets warn if you stick your nose in someone else’s business you may have trouble getting it out again. Do you really want to spend your time sorting out other people’s problems? Focus on what you enjoy and ignore everything else.
sagittarius,A friend or family member may behave irrationally today but you should take it in your stride and take none of it too seriously. Sometimes people do things that don’t make any sense at all. You’ve done that a few times yourself!,sagittarius,Nothing happens truly by chance and if you keep that fact in mind today you may find yourself in a position where you are able to gain an advantage over your rivals. Look for connections and, when you find them, make them work for you.
sagittarius,As the Sun moves into the career area of your chart this weekend the ambitious side of your nature will come to the fore. Set yourself targets that stretch you but which you are still capable of reaching. Do more and do it better too.
sagittarius,Put any doubts you may have behind you and go all out to prove to the world at large you have what it takes. Career-wise this is one of the best times of the year for getting things done, so stop dreaming and start doing.
sagittarius,The Sun in the career area of your chart will boost your professional standing in some way over the next few weeks. If a new job offer comes along you must give it serious consideration. It may be a risky move but, then, life is an adventure.
sagittarius,This is a busy time for you, so take regular breaks, maybe even a short vacation. There is no point running yourself into the ground, especially in pursuit of things of a material nature. Be kind to yourself over the next few days.
sagittarius,At some point today you will have to make a difficult choice. Don’t worry what other people may think of it, or of you, worry only that if you don’t act soon the matter may be taken out of your hands once and for all.
sagittarius,Make sure that what you are working on now is for your benefit, rather than the benefit of people who know they can look good simply by being on your side. Demand that everyone pulls their weight over the next 24 hours.
sagittarius,Don’t think that just because your personal life is going okay at the moment that those around you feel great as well. Someone you are fond of desperately needs your assistance but is too shy to ask. Find out who it is and help them.
sagittarius,You can now see that some of the conclusions you jumped to recently were utterly wrong. Therefore, your first act this week must be to apologize to those whose opinions you belittled. Next time, don’t be so fixed in your opinions. ,sagittarius,You seem to be getting along nicely with someone who a short while ago you thought of as your worst enemy. It’s funny how quickly things can change isn’t it? Now ask yourself: what can you change to make your financial situation more secure?,sagittarius,Doors that have been closed to you in the past will open over the next few days. People who were reluctant to assist you before will now be falling over themselves to help you out. Don’t be afraid to move forwards – and fast.
sagittarius,Others may be winding down a bit now but you must keep the tempo going and make sure you stay visible. There are some big opportunities coming up, so make sure important people know who you are, where you are and what you can do.
sagittarius,There is an easy route and a difficult route to the place you want to be. It may be tempting to take the difficult route just so you can impress other people but why make life hard for yourself when you don’t have to? Enjoy the journey.
sagittarius,If you need to ask someone in a position of authority for a favor this is one of the best times to approach them. For some reason they are in a charitable mood. It doesn’t matter why, it matters only that you take advantage of it.
sagittarius,Although there are some details you can leave to other people this weekend the planets warn you must take care of the important stuff yourself. You also need to be on top of what’s going on at work, otherwise you’ll be at a disadvantage.
sagittarius,Focus on things that highlight your strengths rather than things that highlight your weaknesses. No one expects you to be perfect but if you follow your instincts and be true to your nature you’ll come closer than most people manage.
sagittarius,Your working routine is likely to be disrupted during the early part of the week but even if it is you won’t be too worried. There is so much going on in your life at the moment that you could probably do with a rest.
sagittarius,Tread extra carefully when dealing with employers and other authority figures over the next 24 hours. You may feel you are on solid ground but today’s full moon could upset things by making some people far too emotional. Stay calm and carry on.
sagittarius,Your attempt to resolve a domestic dispute of some kind is not going to work, at least not today. Neptune, planet of illusion, is making it increasingly hard to see what the real problem is, so stand away and give it some time.
sagittarius,So many things have changed in your life of late that you could probably do with a few days when they stay just as they are. And that’s what is likely to happen as Saturn slows everything down. At last, you’ll get some peace.
sagittarius,Come the weekend you will be free to express yourself in ways which may not have been possible before. However, you will also have to exercise a certain amount of self-discipline. If you say too much the backlash could be uncomfortable.
sagittarius,Believe that nothing is beyond you this weekend. Believe that you can do as you please. After weeks, maybe months, of being told by the critics that you will never make it you now have the chance to prove them wrong. Take it.
sagittarius,If you have agreed to take on certain responsibilities then you are obliged to see them through to the end. Yes, you can now see it was foolish to agree to things that do not inspire or benefit you personally but whose fault was that? ,sagittarius,You know a good thing when you see it and what you see today will get your mind racing. How can you make it work for you? How can you make it pay? Don’t let others tell you it’s selfish to think that way – it’s just common sense.
sagittarius,Try not to be so self-critical. If something has not worked out the way you expected it to, well, that’s just the way it is. On this occasion you may have failed but it’s all good experience and next time you’ll get it right. Move on.
sagittarius,The way you react to problems of a partnership nature is of the utmost importance today. If you criticize others too harshly then you must expect to make yourself unpopular – and most likely make matters worse. Strive to see the good in everyone.
sagittarius,A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, so whatever it is you discover today don’t act on it yet. In the fullness of time you’ll find it is only half of the picture – and it’s the other half that matters more. Be patient.
sagittarius,You may have strong views on controversial topics but the planets warn this is not the right time to make an issue of them. Wait until the Sun moves in your favor on the 23rd – then you can do your bit to save the world.
sagittarius,A dispute of some kind may be upsetting but come the middle of next week the cosmic picture will look very different indeed. It seems this is one of those occasions when the air needs to be cleared so everyone involved can move on.
sagittarius,Arguments of one sort or another are likely this week, so be careful you don’t open your mouth and put both feet in it! You have a tendency to speak first and worry about what you have said later. Okay, correction, sometimes you don’t worry at all.
sagittarius,How much of what you believe is based on fact and how much is based on wishful thinking? That is what you need to discover as the Sun’s change of signs leads to a change of perspective as well. Don’t be afraid to junk old ideas.
sagittarius,If you cannot fix something yourself today then ask for assistance. You have so many friends who will happily help you out but the first move must come from you. They know how snappy you can be if they get involved without being invited.
sagittarius,You may recently have lost something of value but what you gain over the next few days will more than make up for it. Change is a constant in everyone’s lives but change does not have to be bad. Embrace the future.
sagittarius,It would appear that on the work front someone is trying to undermine you by talking you down in front of employers and other important people. Don’t worry, they won’t get anywhere. The only success they will have is in making themselves look foolish.
sagittarius,You may find it hard to get motivated this weekend but don’t worry about it. As mind planet Mercury moves into the most sensitive area of your chart you will want to spend more time thinking than doing. You’ll more than make up for it later.
sagittarius,If you don’t care for a certain person there is no point pretending that you do. You must be honest about what you feel this coming week, otherwise you may find you are wasting time on people you have absolutely no interest in.
sagittarius,Are you motivated by hope or by fear? As a larger-than-life Sag it’s more likely to be the former than the latter but there are still times when worry gets on top of you and that could easily happen today. Count your blessings, and celebrate them.
sagittarius,You may find it hard to put your point of view across today, but that’s okay. There is actually nothing that needs to be said immediately, so keep quiet and use your time to improve your mind in some way. Read more, talk less!,sagittarius,Your independence is precious to you and, sadly, that means you are likely to clash with someone who does not believe you should be allowed to have radical opinions. Will you be tactful about it? About as tactful as you usually are!,sagittarius,Yes, you are highly independent, but there are some things that can only be done as part of a team. You may be eager to get things started but until those you work alongside are ready to begin you won’t make much progress.
sagittarius,If you have something to say, something you suspect won’t go down well with certain people, you are advised to speak up before communications planet Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow. Leave it any longer and the words won’t make sense.
sagittarius,Ease up a bit. Don’t push yourself so hard. The planets urge you to enjoy the kind of laidback weekend that has been few and far between in recent months. Give yourself permission to go wild for a while. No one can say you have not earned it.
sagittarius,The approaching eclipse will help you see both sides of a dispute that threatens to disrupt your plans, which in turn will help you find ways to resolve it. Never forget there are two sides to every story – though there’s no such thing as fairy stories.
sagittarius,Don’t change your plans because of a minor setback. What appears to be a disappointment now may, in the long-term, be a blessing in disguise. And remember: what was a good idea yesterday will probably still be a good idea tomorrow.
sagittarius,Your circumstances will change for the better over the next few weeks but over the next few days there will be times when it seems as if things are moving backwards. Be patient. It will all come right in the end. Somehow it always does.
sagittarius,You will find it easy to approach people today who in the past may have seemed distant or unfriendly. Most likely they only appeared that way because they were scared of your big personality! Break the ice and make new friendships.
sagittarius,Try not to read into situations things which do not exist. Today’s cosmic picture is misleading to say the least, so don’t make decisions on what you think colleagues or loved ones have been saying – chances are you have misinterpreted their meaning.
sagittarius,The nicer you are to someone today the more they will take liberties – it’s really that simple. The planets warn you won’t get anywhere by appealing to the better side of this person’s nature – there is a very good chance they simply don’t have one.
sagittarius,If you allow emotional considerations to influence matters of common sense over the next 48 hours you may find around the middle part of next week that you have taken a completely wrong turning. Make sure your head rules your heart.
sagittarius,You need to wake up to the fact that opportunities lie all around you. The planets indicate that someone in a position of authority is about to take a shine to you, so get serious about your ambitions. Show the world what you can do.
sagittarius,You need to seize the initiative and make things happen. For some strange reason you have been a bit too fearful in recent weeks, and because of that opportunities have gone begging. Get your confidence back, then get on with making your mark.
sagittarius,You may have strong opinions about serious issues but you don’t have to be aggressive about them. On the contrary, with Venus, planet of harmony, linked with your ruler Jupiter today you will accomplish much more if you talk and act nice.
sagittarius,You will have to make a difficult decision over the next 24 hours but because you know without doubt what is right and what is wrong you will make it quickly and with a clear conscience. As a Fire sign you are never afraid to act.
sagittarius,You may not be sure where an idea came from – was it conjured up by your own imagination or did you see or hear something that inspired you? – but you can and you must make good use of it. If you don’t, a rival most certainly will.
sagittarius,If you push yourself beyond your natural limits today you may regret it come the start of next week. If you need to free up more time try wasting less of it on trivial pursuits. There are more than enough hours in a day to finish what needs to be done.
sagittarius,Mars in your sign links with values planet Venus today, encouraging you to aim high when it comes to your beliefs and ideals. Others may say you are living in fantasy land, and maybe you are, but you’ve got to live somewhere, so why not there?,sagittarius,Slow down a bit and prepare yourself, mentally, emotionally and physically, for the exertions that lie ahead. Don’t get involved in anything that is likely to drain your energy today. Your health and wellbeing are the only things that matter.
sagittarius,What seemed fresh and exciting a while back now seems dull and boring, but is that really the case or is it just because you have allowed your mind to get stuck in a rut? The only person who can make it fresh and exciting again is you.
sagittarius,Don’t let people in positions of power intimidate you. You can be your own worst enemy at times, not least because you doubt, for no good reason, that you have what it takes to compete and succeed at the highest level. But you do, you do!,sagittarius,You may want the good times to last forever but deep down you know you need to get serious and, among other things, turn your attention inward, to what makes you tick. It’s not true that Sags don’t know how to think, and you’ll prove it today.
sagittarius,Your imagination is extremely active at the moment, which means you should make a point of focusing on good things only. If you let negative thoughts take hold they will be very hard to shake off again. Reality begins in the mind.
sagittarius,Money issues of one sort or another will come to the fore over the next 48 hours and you MUST do something about them. If you don’t you can be sure that other people will and it will be you who ends up paying the most.
sagittarius,There are so many things you would like to change in your life but there is one thing, and one thing only, that demands to be altered. You know what it is and you know you have been putting it off. Time to get serious and get busy. ,sagittarius,You may feel that a situation is getting out of hand but is it as bad as you fear? Probably not. Sometimes you fear the worst even when you have every reason to expect the best. Have a little more faith in the goodness of the world.
sagittarius,What can you do to make the world a better place? What can you do to make a difference to other people’s lives? The planets indicate you can be a force for good over the next few days. How? By acting according to your highest principles.
sagittarius,For some reason certain people seem determined to find fault with your performance, but now that you know that you can take steps to make sure your performance is excellent. If you can, find ways to turn their criticism back at them.
sagittarius,You may feel as if you are getting nowhere fast at the moment but on a deeper level you are in fact making considerable progress. What takes place in your subconscious mind will eventually filter through to your daily life.
sagittarius,Something you believed in for a long time now appears to be misguided and you may be a bit embarrassed that you supported it so strongly. Don’t be. There’s nothing wrong with strong opinions. The important thing is you learned from the experience.
sagittarius,A major change of direction is not needed, despite what some people may be telling you. All you require is a little more faith in your own abilities. No way are your rivals more creative than you – you’re in a league of your own. ,sagittarius,Plans made over the weekend may have to be changed or abandoned as reality sets in. The simple fact is you do not have the time or the resources to do what you said you would do. Next time, don’t make promises so easily.
sagittarius,Why are you so determined to look on the gloomy side of life? No doubt it has something to do with all that cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart but you don’t have to worry. Smile – life is still good. ,sagittarius,Before embarking on a course of action that you have no way of knowing will work out well or badly, ask yourself if it is really what you want. It could be you have made a snap decision based on emotion rather than common sense.
sagittarius,There may be times today and over the weekend when it seems as if there are new difficulties to overcome in every direction, but is that actually so or is it your mind playing tricks on you? Most likely it’s the latter, so don’t be too concerned. ,sagittarius,You have made more than enough excuses for a friend or colleague whose behavior has been, to say the least, questionable. Let them know that the next time they make a major error of judgement they are on their own – and mean it.
sagittarius,What is it you want the most? Once you have put a name to your desire you will be amazed how easy it is to make it your own. This is also a good time to get serious about your cash flow situation. Earn more or spend less.
sagittarius,A missed opportunity to communicate may not seem important now but it will cost time and energy you can ill afford later on. Don’t plan what you have to say, just say it and let the words find their own way to the target. ,sagittarius,Your main problem at the moment seems to be that you are trying to do everything at once. The kind of changes you envisage will take a long time to bring about, maybe even a lifetime, so pace yourself. Ultimately, it’s the journey that matters.
sagittarius,Something will challenge your established opinions today and you could even find yourself agreeing with ideas and theories you once dismissed as rubbish. One of the good things about your sign is that you are willing to move with the times.  ,sagittarius,Good fortune will come your way this weekend and you thoroughly deserve it. The entry of values planet Venus into your sign means you will realize just how lucky you are, in love and in life in general. Enjoy every moment of it. ,sagittarius,Not all the comments aimed in your direction this week will be flattering but you are not the sort to let that worry you. With the Sun moving into your sign in a matter of days it’s what you do that matters, not what others say.
sagittarius,Don’t try to finish something that has become a bit of a chore in recent weeks. The reason you have lost interest in it is because your attitude towards it has changed. It may have been important yesterday but it is no longer important today.
sagittarius,You have important business to finish and you must not let anyone stand in your way. Also, don’t let yourself be distracted by issues that, while they may be a lot of fun, have no relevance to the task at hand. Be direct. Be decisive. ,sagittarius,It would appear that someone has taken your fancy but if you are smart you won’t give them the impression that you are desperate. If you do all the chasing at the beginning of your relationship that will be the pattern for the future as well. ,sagittarius,With mind planet Mercury linked to Mars today you will at long last be able to put a name to what has been worrying you for days, weeks, even months. Now you know what it is you must be positive and do something about.
sagittarius,There is magic in the air this weekend. With the Sun’s move into your birth sign followed immediately by a powerful new moon there is nothing you cannot do. Don’t try to do everything though. Focus your energy in a single direction. ,sagittarius,Romantic Venus’s link to changes planet Uranus in midweek means that logic and reason are of secondary importance. It is love that makes the world go round and it is love you must allow to guide you. It will take you to some enjoyable places.
sagittarius,No one doubts your appetite for hard work but even a Sag needs to slow down once in a while. Venus in your birth sign urges you match each hour of work you do with an hour of relaxation. Your wellbeing is important. ,sagittarius,Just because you see things differently to most other people does not mean you are out of step – it could mean you are the only one who knows where you are going. If friends tell you one thing but your instincts tell you another, trust your instincts. ,sagittarius,Try not to say anything too drastic or hurtful today or it may take weeks or even months to win back a loved one’s trust. Sometimes you speak without thinking and give others the impression you don’t care about their feelings. ,sagittarius,The obvious solution to a problem is not necessarily the right one and today’s cosmic outlook urges you to try something that has not been done before. It may or may not come off but it will definitely expand your outlook, and that’s good. ,sagittarius,There are certain things in your world that have become too predictable and need shaking up. The entry of Mercury into your sign today will encourage you to begin new habits and routines. Take a risk if you have to – it’s what Sag is all about.
sagittarius,Time spent checking details this weekend will not be time wasted. This is your time of the year and no doubt you are eager to be on the move and get important things done, but whatever it is you are aiming to do you must plan ahead.
sagittarius,There is nothing you cannot do – or persuade other people to do for you – if you put your mind to it. Travel and social plans are highlighted this week and once Mars changes signs on Thursday you will be even more adventurous than usual.
sagittarius,It is time to stop daydreaming and get down to essentials. What exists in your mind’s eye could and should exist in the real world too, so quit with the excuses and make it happen. According to the planets it really is now or never. ,sagittarius,You may have good reason to be annoyed with a certain individual but is it worth the effort and the anguish? Probably not. You may not be able to forgive but you can certainly forget – for your benefit, not theirs,sagittarius,You can find it hard to apply yourself to routine tasks and that will be even more of a problem than usual today and tomorrow. If you feel the need to get out into the world and explore then do so. Don’t let anything hold you back.
sagittarius,Today’s Sun-Uranus link means there are major changes on the way, changes that will benefit you in so many ways. If there is a creative project you have been toying with now is the time to get serious about it. Make it work.
sagittarius,Your main task today is to look rationally at what is upsetting you. Stand back from your personal feelings and ask yourself if it is of any real importance. Most likely it isn’t, so why waste time getting worked up about it? ,sagittarius,A full moon in your opposite sign of Gemini will make emotional upsets seem more important than they are this weekend. A friend or relative may not be as pleasant as usual but that does not mean they no longer like you.
sagittarius,You may be desperate to get things moving again but with Jupiter, your ruler, turning retrograde this week you will have to accept that some people don’t want to be rushed. If you can’t beat them join them – take your time and get it right.
sagittarius,You know that what you believe in is right and you know that what someone else believes in is totally and utterly wrong. How do you convince them to change their outlook? You don’t. Let them learn from their own mistakes. ,sagittarius,Sometimes you are suspicious for no good reason but today you are right to be skeptical of what you see and hear. Most of all you need to question what work colleagues are telling you – it could be a complete pack of lies. ,sagittarius,You need to turn your attention to matters of a financial nature. It could well be the case that you have spent too much in recent weeks and with values planet Venus moving into the money area of your chart you must find ways to make savings.
sagittarius,Mercury in your sign fills your head with lots of ideas, but how do you decide which are good and which are bad? Fortunately you don’t have to decide immediately. Just note your ideas down somewhere safe and come back to them later.
sagittarius,There may be times when you think that your lucky streak has come to an end but it’s not nearly over yet. The only thing that might hold you back is if you allow negative thoughts to take root. It’s all good – so enjoy life.
sagittarius,Don’t try to force your ideas on other people – gentle persuasion is by far the best policy, especially when dealing with those who are naturally skeptical. The softer you speak the more they will believe you know what you are talking about.
sagittarius,Be confident by all means but don’t start thinking you can do what you like, when you like, to who you like with no risk of payback. There is a danger this week that you could go too far and set yourself up for a fall.
sagittarius,If you let your emotions get the better of you today you will most likely regret it later in the week. However bad you think something may be, and however bad it may actually be, it really isn’t worth getting worked up about. ,sagittarius,You won’t lack for confidence today – you are in one of those moods when the thought of failure does not enter your head and because of that you could succeed beyond your wildest dreams. Or you could fall flat on your face! ,sagittarius,Do you give a colleague your support and risk falling out with someone in authority? Or do you side with the powers that be and risk losing a friend? Only you can decide but it’s got to be one or the other. You can’t fudge the issue. ,sagittarius,Friends may not be as supportive as you would like them to be but don’t let that stop you pursuing your goals. You don’t need anyone to endorse your ambitions, you just need to get on and do what you know to be right.
sagittarius,You need to find ways to boost your income and the Sun’s move into the money area of your chart will certainly help. Don’t dismiss a creative idea that pops into your head as too outrageous – it could be the solution you’ve been searching for.
sagittarius,The Sun leaves your sign today and there is a new moon in the money area of your chart tomorrow, which suggests you now have to pay for something you got a great deal of enjoyment from in recent weeks. It was worth every cent!,sagittarius,Unexpected changes may unsettle you today but it won’t be long before you regain your balance and find ways to make them pay. As one of the zodiac’s more flexible signs you find it easy to adapt to new situations.
sagittarius,Saturn’s move into your sign today marks the start of a two-year phase that will test you. That may not sound like fun but the good news is you can handle whatever life throws at you – in fact you will enjoy the challenge.
sagittarius,You may seem rough and tough to some people but deep down you are a big softie and what happens today will prove it. Someone who needs a helping hand will have much to thank you for. It could be the start of a beautiful friendship. ,sagittarius,Yours is a sign noted for its enthusiasm, but too much of the stuff today could cause you problems, so think before you act. If there are a lot of little jobs that have to be done, consider paying someone to do them for you. ,sagittarius,There is no such thing as a sure thing and if you keep that fact in mind today you won’t go far wrong. Certainly not as wrong as some of your friends, who seem to think they can do as they please and get away with it. ,sagittarius,Be nice by all means this weekend but don’t let someone off the hook when they clearly do not deserve it. If you want to avoid problems in the future it might be a smart move to come down on them hard in the present. ,sagittarius,Money matters will be top of your agenda as you go into the new year and that’s good because you really do need to get your financial house in order. If getting rich is part of your life plan it won’t just happen as if by magic!,sagittarius,Your logic circuits don’t appear to be functioning too well at the moment, so it might be wise to resist making any major decisions, especially where money matters are concerned. Later in the week your mind will click into gear again. ,sagittarius,With so many things going right for you now you can afford to smile, and come the end of the week you will be laughing out loud. Make sure you laugh with people though and not at them. Help others smile too. ,sagittarius,Give yourself a break and let other people do the heavy lifting. It is unlikely you will get much of any real value done today, so you might as well sit back and watch the passing parade. It should be good for a laugh or two.
sagittarius,You are not the sort to keep quiet, especially when you feel there has been an injustice of some sort, and you will speak your mind today regardless of what the consequences might be. Good for you – someone needs to make a fuss. ,sagittarius,You have spent so much time doing things for other people – don’t you think it’s time you did something for yourself? If you get the chance to enjoy yourself today take it and don’t feel guilty. You have earned the right to have fun.
sagittarius,Trust your instincts this weekend, even if no one else does. Where both money matters and affairs of the heart are concerned only you know what is best for your happiness and security, so only you can make those big decisions. ,sagittarius,You may be a bit impulsive over the next two or three days, especially where money matters are concerned. You want so much to be a success that you may be tempted to do something rash, which could lead to an embarrassing failure. ,sagittarius,Today’s full moon suggests you will have to loosen your hold on something you cherish. It may be painful to begin with it won’t be long before you feel a real sense of freedom – you were the one who was being held back.
sagittarius,Don’t let other people’s complaints and criticisms get to you today. You may look confident on the outside but a worm of doubt is burrowing its way into your mind and your rivals will play on that if you give them the chance.
sagittarius,Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours because if you say too much you could hurt a friend’s feelings and chances are they won’t be a friend for much longer. Sometimes you can be rather abrupt in your pronouncements. ,sagittarius,According to the planets you will be taking some important decisions over the next 24 hours. The most important thing of all is that you make it clear to everyone that these decisions are not open to discussion. You have decided and that’s it. ,sagittarius,According to the planets a colleague is envious of your popularity and success and would like nothing better than to bring you down a notch or two. That can only happen if you drop your guard – so stay alert for challenges. ,sagittarius,This should be a lucky time for you, especially if you are on the move. The more you get out and about the more likely it is you will see or hear something that can be turned to your advantage. So why are you still here?,sagittarius,Mars moves into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart this week, which warns you could easily overreact and start a fight over something of no real importance. Save your energy, and your anger, for the issues that really matter. ,sagittarius,Anyone who thinks they can persuade you or coerce you to do something you do not approve of is living in cloud cuckoo land. When it comes to family matters though try not to take such a hard-line stance. Be flexible.
sagittarius,Take extra care when dealing with someone you don’t know much about. They may talk big and try to make you believe they are experts in their chosen field but do you have any real evidence of that? Don’t put your money where their mouth is. ,sagittarius,You will have to deal with someone today who is so slow and so indecisive that it drives you mad. The sad fact is not everyone thinks or acts as quickly as you and sometimes you just have to wait for the slowest one in the group. ,sagittarius,Don’t try too hard to keep your emotions bottled up because it will be better for your health if you let your feelings show. You also need to prove that you are not intimidated by people who throw their weight around. ,sagittarius,The next few days will be lucky for you and what you gain you will thoroughly deserve. Not everyone will agree with that conclusion but not everyone is aware how hard you have worked to get to your current position. ,sagittarius,You need to get your financial house in order before the Sun changes signs on the 20th. That means looking for ways to cut back on your spending. You would be the first to admit you have been a little bit extravagant of late. ,sagittarius,Don’t worry if you don’t have much money in your pocket as the new week begins, because you will meet up with someone who enjoys buying you things. What will they ask for in return? The pleasure of your company of course! ,sagittarius,If a friend or colleague asks for your opinion about something it will pay you to say what you think they want to hear, even if you actually believe the opposite. Arguments of all kinds are best avoided over the next 24 hours. ,sagittarius,This is a good time for traveling and having fun with your friends. Don’t worry if you are a bit short of cash because you will meet up with someone who enjoys buying you things. All they want in return is the pleasure of your company.
sagittarius,Someone may say you have no right to occupy a certain position but as far as you are concerned possession is nine-tenths of the law and you intend to stay right where you are. Who is brave enough to challenge you?,sagittarius,You may have a thousand and one issues to deal with (yes, you do like to exaggerate!) but you must still find time to let loved ones know they mean the world to you. Remember, it’s not about “me” it’s about “us.”,sagittarius,By helpful by all means today but be wary too, especially of people who try to persuade you to lend them money. According to the planets they are up to no good, so keep your money in your pocket where it belongs.
sagittarius,Chances are you will run out of patience with someone you work with this weekend. Spell it out for them that if they can’t keep up then you will leave them behind. You don’t have the time or the patience to deal with stragglers. ,sagittarius,During the early part of the week you may be rather reserved and not much interested in socializing but later you will come out of your shell and get more involved in life. If you are owed a favor, ask for it to be repaid. ,sagittarius,You may find it hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys today, so be on your guard and take nothing for granted. You could also read too much into perfectly normal situations, so don’t jump to conclusions.
sagittarius,What looks like a failure at the beginning of the day will look like a success by the end of the day, which is nice. Also, if you listen to the advice of a well-connected friend you could make some serious money.
sagittarius,A friend or relative will say something thoughtless today and although you won’t let it show your feelings will be hurt. But don’t start plotting your revenge because it’s unlikely they meant to be spiteful. They just didn’t think. ,sagittarius,You are at your best when dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, so forget about your chores and get out into the world and have fun. Does that make you irresponsible? In some people’s eyes maybe, but you just don’t care. ,sagittarius,You keep asking yourself all sorts of questions but the answers are so slow in coming. Don’t let it worry you because some answers always take longer to arrive than others. Just be patient and keep that big brain of yours ticking over. ,sagittarius,Everything is going right for you at the moment, so why do you have that horrible feeling of impending doom? Whatever the reason you really have little to worry about. Whatever challenges life brings you will handle them with ease.
sagittarius,You will say some outrageous things over the next few days but there is every chance that you will get away with it. People expect you to be controversial and outspoken, so go right ahead and stir things up a little – or a lot! ,sagittarius,There seems to be a lot of tension in your dealings with other people at the moment, both in your personal affairs and at work. The good news is that tension can be creative. Use it as a source of power to get things done. ,sagittarius,Social activities will be a lot of fun today and romance is on the cards as well. What starts out as just a friendship could grow deep and serious very quickly – it will certainly be more than just another fling.
sagittarius,Life is too short to worry about what other people think of you, so follow your desires come what may. You have played by the book far too often of late, so now go to the other extreme and try being outrageous. ,sagittarius,If someone says you need to be cautious you should listen to, and act on, their advice. It may not be your natural way of doing things but a few days from now you can make up for it by going to the other extreme. ,sagittarius,If you allow fear to guide your thoughts and actions you will miss out on something that could make your life so much more enjoyable. Why should you be afraid of something just because it’s new? Embrace the future. ,sagittarius,Spend more time with partners and loved ones this weekend. It does not matter how important your work may be, your family is more important by far and now is the ideal time to make sure they know that.
sagittarius,Take a friend’s tip-off seriously because their expert knowledge could help you make some extra cash over the next few days. You can be sure if you don’t take advantage of it someone else will, so don’t be slow off the mark. ,sagittarius,Spell out what it is you are planning to do and let friends and work colleagues know you could do with some assistance. Chances are they will rush to your side and do whatever they can to help. They know a winner when they see one. ,sagittarius,Someone you work or do business with will be hard to pin down today but before you get angry about it consider that maybe it’s what they want you to do. If you lose your temper it will just make them look good.
sagittarius,If you get the chance to do a good deed for a friend or colleague over the next two or three days don’t wait to be asked, just wade in and put things right for them. You will earn their eternal gratitude. ,sagittarius,Someone will annoy you big time today. No matter what you say or do they will disagree with you and attempt to derail your plans. They can only succeed if you let them though, so be tough without getting angry. ,sagittarius,One way or another you must get your message across. Hopefully people will stop what they are doing and listen to what you have to say but, if not, grab hold of them and yell at them face-to-face. They will hear you okay.
sagittarius,Something you have been planning for ages is almost ready to launch but before you get at it you must let loved ones know what it is you are up to. If nothing else it will save them from thinking you’ve lost your mind! ,sagittarius,Your values will change somewhat over the next few days. What you think you believe in today may not be what you believe in come the end of the month, and that’s good because it shows you are still evolving mentally. ,sagittarius,Minor disagreements could get out of hand today, so promise yourself now that no matter what the provocation might be you won’t rise to the bait. Whatever the issue happens to be it’s not worth getting worked up about. ,sagittarius,The cosmic changes now taking place will help you get to grips with issues that have been causing you grief. On the home front especially you need to realize just how petty and unnecessary certain things are. Time to move on. ,sagittarius,Social activities will be a lot of fun over the next few days but the downside is you will spend too much money. If you have to go cap in hand to a friend or relative for a loan later expect them to want something in return.
sagittarius,Don’t make any travel plans for today or tomorrow because there is something special coming your way and if you move you may miss it – or, more likely, it will miss you. You’re right where you should be, so stay put.
sagittarius,Whatever you begin over the next 48 hours will end in triumph at some stage in the not too distant future, so be bold and be the one who acts first and makes things happen. Creativity plus courage equals guaranteed success. ,sagittarius,You will have to deal with people who can’t think clearly this week and there will be times when you could scream at them. Don’t. It will only make matters worse and maybe even reduce them to tears. Some people are just so fragile. ,sagittarius,Saturn in your sign at odds with the Sun today means you must not get worked up about something which, in the greater scheme of things, is of only minor importance. Also, if something is denied you it means you are not supposed to have it. ,sagittarius,By all means plan ahead but try not to actually do anything. If you give your brain a rest today it will be working better than ever later in the week, and that’s when the important decisions will have to be made.
sagittarius,If you need to persuade someone to see things your way or to do you a favor this is the time to make your play. They have no defense against your charm, your energy and your way with words. You’re irresistible! ,sagittarius,You will have words with someone whose personality or behavior rubs you up the wrong way. Less timid souls might keep their opinions to themselves but you’re not the kind to back off. Why should you when you’re the one in the right? ,sagittarius,If someone throws their weight around today your first instinct will be to start throwing things back at them, but don’t be too hasty. A more effective response is to ignore them and starve them of the attention they so obviously crave.
sagittarius,You won’t let anyone take liberties over the next 48 hours – in fact your ruler Jupiter is so strong at the moment that you will get your way through sheer force of personality. No one is big enough or brash enough to oppose you.
sagittarius,This will either be a week to remember or a week to forget, depending on how ready you are to adapt to changing circumstances. If you go with the flow you will achieve great things. If you swim against the tide you may get swept away. ,sagittarius,You will have to deal with someone who hates to take risks – in fact they are the opposite of you in every way. According to the planets you will need this individual’s assistance in the near future, so be nice – or at least pretend. ,sagittarius,You don’t need anyone’s permission to have fun today. If life has been a bit dull of late then by all means spice things up. No doubt some people will remind you that these are serious times but that just makes laughter all the more valuable.
sagittarius,By all means listen to what others have to tell you today but don’t think for a moment that you are obliged to do what they suggest. In fact you are advised to hold off making any kind of major move while the moon is full.
sagittarius,The thing to keep in mind is that you have nothing to prove. Certain people will try to make you feel like a failure but the only real failures are those who never aim high or take risks – and no one can say that of you.
sagittarius,No matter how ambitious a Sagittarius you happen to be you will find it difficult to get excited about work matters this weekend, and that’s good because they are not that important. What is important is your love life. It should be enjoyable too.
sagittarius,Cosmic activity in the most energetic area of your chart means you won’t take no for an answer, and nor should you. Some people may try to tell you that your aims are unrealistic but they’re jealous because they are not as dynamic as you.
sagittarius,Focus on what really matters. It may be hard for someone like you who is so easily bored to concentrate on just one thing at a time but it must be done if you are to make progress. What is your number one goal? Go for it! ,sagittarius,Cosmic activity in your fellow Fire signs of Aries and Leo means everything comes easy to you at the moment. But that does not mean you no longer have to make an effort. On the contrary, the harder you work the easier it will get.
sagittarius,There is good in everybody and if you sometimes find that hard to believe what happens by the end of the day will surely convince you. It won’t take much to restore your faith in human nature. Try not to misplace it again.
sagittarius,Saturn in your sign warns that life is not as straightforward as you seem to think it is. What happens over the next few days, as Saturn begins one of its retrograde phases, will encourage you to plan ahead and not leave so much to chance.
sagittarius,What you choose to do today may annoy some people but don’t let that stop you. The fact is you have done plenty of things to please them in the past and now you intend doing something to please yourself. About time.
sagittarius,What other people want is irrelevant – it’s what you want that matters. The planets indicate that certain individuals have been playing on your feelings and making you feel guilty so they benefit. It’s time to get tough and take back control.
sagittarius,Devote your time and energy during the early part of the new week to ironing out any emotional problems you may have with loved ones and relatives. No problem is so big or so bad that it cannot be resolved by honest communication. ,sagittarius,Nothing in your life is so urgent that it must be done right this very moment and if anyone tells you otherwise they are not to be trusted. Bide your time and let others make the first move. You can learn from their mistakes. ,sagittarius,Start something new today, something that helps you contribute more to the world around you. When the Sun changes signs at the end of the week you will find it suddenly takes off – and your reputation will take off with it.
sagittarius,By all means do something dramatic today, something that makes the world sit up and take notice, but make sure it isn’t something that is going to damage your reputation. Know where the line is and be smart enough to stay this side of it.
sagittarius,Challenges are opportunities in disguise – which means you will have at least one and maybe several opportunities to shine over the next few days. Don’t let what happened – or did not happen – in the past hold you back. It’s different now. ,sagittarius,Set your sights high and refuse to settle for second best. Your confidence will soar over the next few days and you will start to believe that anything is possible. One of the best times of the year is about to begin. Make every minute count.
sagittarius,Will fortune smile on you and make all your dreams come true? Maybe, although it’s likely to be a bit of an exaggeration, but make no mistake: now the Sun is transiting your fellow Fire sign of Aries all things are possible – for you. ,sagittarius,Be nice to someone you don’t feel like being nice to over the next 24 hours – and something nice will happen to you later in the week. This is one of those occasions when what you do comes back to you almost instantly. ,sagittarius,Something you say may hurt a friend’s feelings but don’t worry about it because they are not as weak as they like to make out. Call it as you see it. You don’t have to tone down your comments just to make others feel good.  ,sagittarius,You can expect almost everyone you meet to be nice to you today and, of course, you will be nice in return. However, don’t let your guard down completely because at least one such “nice” individual has designs on your money.
sagittarius,Someone you live or work with will get the wrong end of the stick today and blame you for something that is not your fault. By all means clear your name and demand an apology but don’t hold it against them. Everyone makes mistakes. ,sagittarius,This is a good time to think of ways to reduce your daily chores and also to improve your health. You may not be able to make any major changes for two or three weeks but you can and should make plans now – it’s a start.
sagittarius,Your generosity knows no bounds: you want to do everything for everyone. Common sense should tell you that isn’t actually possible but you will do your best to make a positive difference in the world over the next 24 hours.
sagittarius,If you have been aiming too high or taking too much for granted you will find out about it over the next 48 hours. Whatever happens you will certainly have to cut back on unnecessary expenditure. Money doesn’t grow on trees you know.
sagittarius,It’s not like you to stay quiet but for some reason you feel you cannot speak freely. The good news is that when Mercury, planet of communication, changes signs on Tuesday you will be invited to have your say – and you won’t hold back.
sagittarius,You can turn almost any situation to your advantage now but don’t get carried away and take on someone who is obviously several leagues above you on the power ladder. There is always someone stronger or better connected, even for a Sagittarius. ,sagittarius,Why is it that every other person you meet wants to start a fight? Whatever the reason – and there may be no real reason at all – you must resist the urge to get involved. There is no percentage in it. Whatever the outcome, you will lose. ,sagittarius,You need to be on top of your game today, physically, mentally and emotionally, and that means a positive attitude is a must. Don’t let anyone tell you that you are aiming too high or expecting too much because it isn’t true.
sagittarius,Today’s link between the Sun and your ruling planet Jupiter means you can get away with almost anything. No, that is not an invitation to break the law but you can push the boundaries a bit, and a big bit at that.
sagittarius,Speak up and let others know what you think and how you feel. The current cosmic outlook gives you the courage to say things that are unlikely to go down well with people in positions of power, but don’t let that stop you.
sagittarius,Do your own thing in your own way and at your own speed and ignore those who say you could be putting your time and energy to better use. Who knows, they may be right, but if you’re happy then nothing else matters, does it?,sagittarius,Monday’s Sun-Uranus link highlights the lighter side of life, so don’t tie yourself down with the kind of duties and chores you find boring. You are not the kind to be serious – you are at your best when there is a smile on your face. ,sagittarius,Start something new and don’t worry too much about planning ahead. Today’s cosmic influences urge you to think and act as if you cannot possibly fail – and you won’t. The universe knows where you should be going, so let your inner voice guide you.
sagittarius,It’s just as well you enjoy multi-tasking because partners and colleagues will have you running in all directions today. But don’t let it get to the stage where you begin to lose track of what you have done and what you still have to do.
sagittarius,With the Sun, Mercury and Uranus moving through one of the most dynamic areas of your chart you should be out there in the world making things happen. And if you can’t make things happen where you are, get up and go some place else.
sagittarius,Whatever you start now will bring success in the not too distant future, so make it special and make it something you can look back on with pride in years to come. It’s time to let your creative side come to the fore.
sagittarius,Others may say you are being too careful, and maybe you are, but don’t change your ways to please them. Looked at from another perspective it’s not you who is being too careful but they who are taking too many chances.
sagittarius,You must put all thoughts of revenge out of your head this weekend. Whatever may have happened in the past should be left in the past – there can be no room for it in the new life you are building. Lighten up Sagittarius/,sagittarius,Some of the people you meet over the next few days will get on your nerves big time. No matter what you say or how agreeable you try to be they will find reasons to criticize. Don’t let it get to you – they’re to be pitied really.
sagittarius,Your powers of persuasion are at a peak and somehow you will know just what to say and just how to say it for maximum effect. Whatever you want over the next few days you will get – no one will be able to refuse you. ,sagittarius,What you do for or to other people always comes back to you eventually, and if you bear that thought in mind today, and act accordingly, you won’t go far wrong. It’s always better to give than to receive – in the short-term anyway.
sagittarius,Stop worrying about whether or not you are doing the right thing and live the way you feel is right. You don’t have to make a special effort to impress people today – in fact you don’t have to make an effort at all. It’s time to relax.
sagittarius,Look for a compromise solution to some kind of dispute. Yes, you may honestly believe that you are blameless and that the other party should admit that fact and make concessions but it isn’t going to happen. Meet them halfway. ,sagittarius,Today’s new moon in the sympathetic sign of Aries means that all things are possible for you now. Aim high creatively and romantically and don’t doubt for a moment that you will get what you desire. No one will dare to deny you! ,sagittarius,Sometimes you need to be tough and sometimes you need to be tender and over the coming week you will need to use both approaches. Make sure you get them the right way round. If not, you will make enemies of just about everyone! ,sagittarius,You will be the center of attention for all the right reasons over the next 24 hours. Your wit and your charm will attract others to you like moths to a flame. You know all the right words and all the right tricks to get noticed.
sagittarius,You will find yourself in just the right place at just the right time to do something worthwhile today – that’s worthwhile for yourself and worthwhile for other people too. Make the most of it – it won’t always be this easy.
sagittarius,Like it or not you will have to follow the rules today, because if you deviate from what others think is permissible you could get yourself in a whole load of trouble. Sometimes you have no choice but to toe the line.
sagittarius,You have so much to do but time is limited, so don’t waste even a second on things that are not connected to your long-term ambitions. And don’t worry if you tread on a few toes over the next 24 hours – you can always apologize later.
sagittarius,Whatever barrier may be in front of you it won’t be long before you find a way to break through. Strive to be strong, mentally and emotionally, and before you know it what you thought was an immovable obstacle will begin to shift. ,sagittarius,Don’t worry too much if you fall out with a partner or colleague over the next 48 hours as tension has been building up for a while and needs to be released. Come Monday morning you will be the best of friends again. ,sagittarius,If someone makes unreasonable demands of you this week you must be strong and let them know you have no intention of doing what they say. What can they do to force you? Absolutely nothing, so there is no need to be afraid. ,sagittarius,According to the planets you have been focusing on trivia and missing the big stuff. Your life is your own and you can do as you please, of course, but you will mentally kick yourself later if you look back and see what you might have achieved.
sagittarius,If something you are working on does not seem to be making progress most likely it’s because you are trying too hard. You are at your best when you are relaxed, so slow down and calm down and you’ll master it soon.
sagittarius,You will work extremely hard today and for the rest of the week, not for cash or fame but because you want to prove that a goal you set yourself a while back is possible to reach. If you gain in other ways too – that’s a bonus.
sagittarius,A dispute of some kind will come to the boil over the next few days but in a way that’s good because all these negative feelings are not doing you any favors. Once the air has cleared you can move on again, together or on your own.
sagittarius,Partners and loved ones will have plenty to say for themselves today and not all of it will be music to your ears, but if you are smart you will sit there and listen. Once they have let off steam things will quickly get back to normal.
sagittarius,What you think is a problem is actually an opportunity in disguise. As Mercury, planet of the mind, opposes Saturn in your sign this weekend, you need to look beyond the obvious and see beneath the surface. Find out what is really going on. ,sagittarius,Monday’s full moon is likely to play havoc with your confidence but whatever it is that worries you is almost certainly of no real importance. Whatever your position in life, if you believe in yourself then anything, and everything, is possible. ,sagittarius,It may appear to others that you are not doing very much but just because you are not active on the outside does not mean you are not active on the inside. On the contrary, that Sagittarius brain of yours is bubbling with new ideas. ,sagittarius,Don’t tie yourself down to set aims and objectives over the next 24 hours because it is highly likely that things will change fast and you will have no choice but to change with them. All things are possible if you stay flexible.
sagittarius,Go somewhere new and do something different today. The more adventurous you are and the further you travel from your home base the more fun you will have. You will make a new friend too – and maybe you will be more than just friends.
sagittarius,Make sure that everything you do has a purpose today. Despite what you may think to the contrary you do not possess unlimited energy, so ration it carefully, especially on the work front where you are likely to be burdened with extra duties.
sagittarius,Someone who does not share your optimistic way of looking at the world will give you a hard time over the next 48 hours, simply because they cannot stand to see you have fun. So, make it your business to have more fun than ever! ,sagittarius,You may not be your usual extrovert self today but even a Sagittarius needs to take things easy once in a while and according to the planets this is a great time to switch off and not worry too much about the world around you. ,sagittarius,You may not like a certain person very much but you are going to have to work with them and the sooner you accept that fact the sooner your business with each other will be finished and the sooner you can be on your way again.
sagittarius,You feel there is nothing you cannot do. You feel that nothing is too much for you. That could be true but with Mars moving through your opposite sign you must take into account what other people want too. If not, you’ll create enemies.
sagittarius,A problem you have been grappling with may be tough but there is a solution, so keep asking and keep searching and you will find what you are looking for in the end. What you eventually discover will surprise you – by how simple it is.
sagittarius,Jupiter in the sympathetic sign of Leo means you will make your own decisions and take whatever risks you think are necessary over the next 24 hours. You won’t doubt for a moment that you are doing the right thing. And you are.
sagittarius,Before you shake hands on some kind of deal make sure you know what it really entails. If you have any doubts then put off making a decision until early next week – then and only then will you know if it’s the right deal for you. ,sagittarius,You are in an extremely forceful mood at the moment and won’t take orders from anyone, no matter who may be handing them out. Try not to come across as too headstrong though or you could find yourself losing friends,sagittarius,There is a task you have been putting off in the hope that it might go away but, of course, it won’t and today you will have no choice but to knuckle down and get it done. Once you get started you may actually enjoy it. ,sagittarius,Focus on the one or two things that really matter and let everything else look after itself. Like all Sags you are easily distracted but you can and you must concentrate on what is important today, whether or not it interests you personally.
sagittarius,You are about to enter a more positive phase but that does not mean you can do as you please. The Sun’s entry into your opposite sign tomorrow is a boost but it is also an invitation to work more closely with partners and colleagues.
sagittarius,Go out of your way to be nice to partners, loved ones and colleagues today because you will be depending on them a lot over the next few weeks. Do what you can to make life easier for them and you will get plenty in return.
sagittarius,If you make a small change in one thing today the effects are likely to be much bigger than you expected, so act with care and, if in doubt, don’t act at all. Nothing is so important that it has to be dealt with immediately. ,sagittarius,Someone will give you a hard time for no good reason this weekend and you must stand up to them. It does not matter how big or how powerful they may be, you are the one who has right on your side. Make sure they know that.
sagittarius,Be nice to everyone this week, even those people who don’t really deserve it. With the Sun moving through the partnership area of your chart now you will find that what you do for other people you also do for yourself. So do it well.
sagittarius,Do you have the confidence and the know-how to step in and take control of a difficult situation? If so, by all means get involved. If not, stand back and let someone else take the leadership role. It does not have to be you every time.
sagittarius,You don’t have to make apologies to someone you fell out with. Why should you when they are 100 per cent wrong and you are 100 per cent right? On the other hand maybe you should soften your tone. You still have to work with them.
sagittarius,You are focusing on the worst possible outcome to a situation that most likely will never happen. Force yourself to be positive today and go to bed early for a change this evening. Come tomorrow the world will seem a rosier place.
sagittarius,Don’t commit yourself to anything too strenuous today. Save your energy – physical, mental and emotional – for tomorrow and over the weekend when difficult tasks will be easier to handle. After all, Sags are supposed to be calm and laidback.
sagittarius,You may find it hard to put your feelings into words today but you probably won’t need to – your body language will say it all. Loved ones can sense you need some tender loving care and will go out of their way to give it.
sagittarius,Friends and relatives will give you lots of advice over the next 48 hours but is it good advice? According to the planets you cannot trust the way other people’s minds work, so thank them for their suggestions and then follow your own instincts. ,sagittarius,The most important thing over the next few days is that you keep faith with what you are doing. Tuesday’s full moon in your sign could undermine your self-belief and make you inclined to give up for no good reason. Stick with it. ,sagittarius,Aim to discuss your differences with a rival openly and honestly today. The approaching full moon in your sign makes you more emotional than you need to be, so strive to be rational in both your thinking and what you say. ,sagittarius,You believe that nothing can harm you, that you can push your luck to the limit and get away with it. Your self-belief is admirable but reality could make a large dent in your confidence. The full moon in your sign warns against taking risks.
sagittarius,Don’t waste your time and energy trying to figure out something that most likely has no meaning at all. The planets indicate this is one of those occasions when, if you ignore a problem, it won’t be a problem for long, so leave it alone.
sagittarius,If you go it alone today you will do okay, but if you work with others you will accomplish ten times as much. Mars in your opposite sign urges you to put petty differences aside and join with those who share your ideals.
sagittarius,You are in one of your adventurous moods and if you are not off exploring new places over the next few days it can only be because you are short of cash. Find ways to limit your spending in some areas so you can do more in others.
sagittarius,You need to be a bit selfish over the next 48 hours and put your own interests first. With Mars in your opposite sign you must not give others the idea that you can be easily influenced or cheaply bought. Be more assertive. ,sagittarius,If you were thinking of easing your way slowly into the new week then think again. With the Sun linked to your ruler Jupiter on Monday and changes planet Uranus on Wednesday you won’t have time to relax – there is simply too much going on.
sagittarius,You have got to be positive and start thinking in terms of success rather than failure. Most importantly, you have got to believe in yourself. The universe has a way of rewarding those who make the effort to look out for themselves. ,sagittarius,Forget about the things that have gone wrong over the last couple of months because you will more than make up for them over the next few weeks. You have never been the sort who likes to feel sorry for yourself, so don’t start now!,sagittarius,If there is something important you need to say to a partner or relative put it off until tomorrow when Mercury, planet of communication, resumes its normal direction. After that, the words “I love you” will be a lot easier to say.
sagittarius,Think back to what happened earlier in the year. Did you miss out on something because you were afraid to take a chance? If so, and if you regret it, you will soon get the opportunity to make amends. Don’t waste it.
sagittarius,There will be times today when you wonder if you can believe all the nice things certain people are saying about you. Not only should you believe them but you should encourage them to prove it. Let them pamper and praise you.
sagittarius,Do opposites really attract? Yes they do and with so much cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Gemini at the moment you will be drawn to someone whose personality is as big as your own. Watch out your egos don’t clash!,sagittarius,It will feel as if a weight has been lifted from your shoulders this coming week and no doubt you will want to celebrate, but be warned: there are still a lot of serious issues that need to be deal with. Don’t turn your back on reality.
sagittarius,Don’t push yourself too hard over the next two or three days. Whatever tasks or duties you have to complete, either at home or at work, they can quite safely wait. Strangely, the harder you strive the harder it will be to get things done.
sagittarius,A relationship may be giving you cause for concern but today’s new moon will set your mind at rest. Put your differences behind you and focus on things that unite you, rather than things that divide you. It’s still a match made in Heaven.
sagittarius,Something rather shocking is likely to happen today and looking back in a few days time you will realize you should have seen it coming. Be that as it may you are flexible enough to adapt and survive. You may even thrive.
sagittarius,Try not to take it personally if certain people do not agree with your point of view. If they get the impression that you are a bit thin-skinned they will focus on it mercilessly. Be bold in your own beliefs and accepting of alternative points of view.
sagittarius,Although relationship problems have caused some concern in recent weeks you managed to keep a sense of perspective and did not allow minor differences to become major disputes. That’s good. The benefits will come over the next few days.
sagittarius,The Sun moves into one of the more sensitive areas of your chart this weekend, challenging you to think deeply about where you are going, what you are doing and what it all means. Everything is big about Sagittarius – even the questions.
sagittarius,You may be tempted to deceive someone this week, and if they find out it may not go well for you. Maybe you should admit right now that you have done something wrong. Be honest and you are more likely to be forgiven.
sagittarius,Something or someone will grab your attention and refuse to let go today. This is an exceptionally good time for both creative matters and affairs of the heart. With Jupiter, your ruler, involved you are sure to be the center of attention. ,sagittarius,You will get the red carpet treatment both at home and at work today but you are advised to stay modest and, where possible, keep a low profile. If you call attention to yourself you could be a target for gossip and rumor.
sagittarius,You need to join forces with like-minded people over the next few days or you could miss out on a really big prize. You may think you know more than most, and maybe you do, but that does not mean you can do it all on your own. ,sagittarius,You need to get serious about your money situation. You may be tempted to take a risk of some kind and bet against the odds but if you do you could end up even more out of pocket than you are now. Don’t gamble. Save. ,sagittarius,You seem to be doing a lot for other people and not so much for yourself. That needs to change. To start with you must learn to say “no” whenever anyone, no matter how close, asks you to do things that you clearly don’t enjoy.
sagittarius,Affairs of the heart are under good stars this weekend and you will make a lot of new friends. However, if you are traveling over the next couple of days it is unlikely your schedule will go entirely to plan, not that it will bother you much.
sagittarius,For some strange reason you are allowing your emotions to get the better of you. The good news is it won’t last long, but over the next few days you must fight the urge to give in to negative feelings. When the world turns so will your mood.
sagittarius,Because the approaching full moon takes place in the money area of your chart there is a danger that you will waste what you have gained in recent weeks. Be especially careful when socializing. Don’t spend money just to impress your friends.
sagittarius,If you have to say something unpleasant today don’t try to wrap it up in sugar coating. Others are used to you being blunt, so speak up and let everyone know why you are unhappy – and what they can do to make you smile again. ,sagittarius,Something will stimulate your mind, broaden your horizons and make you realize that the world is a bigger and more interesting place than you thought. Meetings with exotic people will be especially rewarding today – both emotionally and financially.
sagittarius,You need to be a little more ruthless in your professional dealings, especially if you are one of those Sags who likes to give others the benefit of the doubt. Put your own needs first this weekend. You can go back to being a nice guy later.
sagittarius,Career matters will be uppermost in your mind over the next few days but you must not let them crowd everything else out. Make sure loved ones feel appreciated. Let them know your life revolves more around them than around work.
sagittarius,Something dramatic is likely to happen over the next 24 hours, something that takes everyone by surprise. However, if you keep your wits about you and react quickly while everyone else is dithering you could make some serious money.
sagittarius,You need to get your feelings off your chest and let certain people know that you don’t care in the slightest what they say or do or think about you. That might sound a bit extreme but it’s the only approach they understand. ,sagittarius,You have allowed certain issues to slide and if you don’t do something about them soon it will be too late. The fact is you have relied too heavily on others to make decisions for you. There is still time to put things right, but be quick.
sagittarius,Don’t let unexpected events undermine your confidence today, especially on the work front where a series of setbacks seems to have dented your morale. Everyone goes through times like this – it’s part of the ebb and flow of real life.
sagittarius,Although you are usually quite flexible in your relationships the planets suggest you will be somewhat unyielding today. Be warned, however, that if it comes down to a battle of wills you are likely to be the long-term loser.
sagittarius,Don’t waste time and money on something that involves a high degree of risk this weekend. The planets warn that you must keep things simple and keep in mind that you never get something for nothing – nothing worth having at any rate.
sagittarius,Forget about what happened yesterday or the day before that – the only thing that matters now is what you are going to do next. Monday’s Sun-Uranus link may be disruptive but don’t strive to be different – just be yourself.
sagittarius,Cosmic activity in one of the more negative areas of your chart means that your confidence may take a bit of a dip over the next few days. Mind you, your self-belief is usually so high that most people will still think you’re incredible. ,sagittarius,You may not be able to explain how you have reached a certain conclusion but you know it is right, so have the courage of your convictions and act on it immediately. Money matters are especially well starred over the next few days.
sagittarius,Someone you thought you could trust is actually conspiring against you. Fortunately, someone who is a real friend will warn you, but will you believe them? It may look like jealousy but they really don’t want to see you get hurt. ,sagittarius,Focus on what is truly important today: your long-term financial security. What you begin over the next 24 hours will pay big dividends in the not too distant future, so get involved and aim to enjoy the good things in life.
sagittarius,Today’s events will maneuver you in a direction you are not sure you want to go. According to the planets it is not only the right thing for you but, deep down, you know it is too, so don’t fight it too hard. ,sagittarius,You have a great deal of charisma and others will look up to you and follow you wherever you go over the next 48 hours. Which will do wonders for your ego, of course, but do you actually know where you are going and why?,sagittarius,The Sun moves into the most adventurous area of your chart on Thursday and it will feel as if you have been let off a leash. Do whatever it is that takes your fancy and don’t worry about those who think you are mad. So what if you are! ,sagittarius,You have been far too suspicious of late and it has prevented you from taking risks. Maybe that’s no bad thing, seeing as how reckless you can be at times, but in a matter of days you will be back to normal – your idea of normal anyway! ,sagittarius,Whatever challenges you face over the next few days you will deal with each and every one of them with ease. Your confidence is so high at the moment that even those above you on the ladder of success will ask you for advice. ,sagittarius,There is no need to feel guilty about what it is you desire. What you enjoy may not be what others enjoy but that does not mean it is wrong. What a boring world this would be if we were all exactly the same. Thank heaven for Sags!,sagittarius,Something that meant nothing to you in the past now means everything to you and you will spend every spare moment trying to make sense of it. Some may think you have taken leave of your senses but most likely you’ve found them at last. ,sagittarius,The planets indicate that if you knuckle down and work hard you will make the kind of impression that earns big rewards over the next few days. Focus on matters of a practical nature and leave the philosophical stuff to the intellectuals.
sagittarius,The planets indicate that if you knuckle down and work hard you will make the kind of impression that earns big rewards over the next few days. Focus on matters of a practical nature and leave the philosophical stuff to the intellectuals.
sagittarius,Pay no attention to whatever rumors are doing the rounds because they are not true. If certain people choose to spread gossip that’s up to them but you are under no obligation to take part in their silly games. Deal only in facts. ,sagittarius,Recent weeks may not have been easy but what happens today and throughout the week will convince you that a corner has been turned. If you trust fate to guide you it won’t be long before you find true happiness.
sagittarius,Approach the day in a positive frame of mind and you will accomplish a lot. Approach the day in a negative frame of mind and you will accomplish the same things but you won’t get much joy from them. Attitude is so important.
sagittarius,You will be very persuasive today and others will find it hard to deny you whatever it is that you want. But do you know what you want? If you don’t your powers of persuasion could be wasted on trivial things. It’s time to get serious. ,sagittarius,Take care that in your haste to make a name for yourself on the work front you don’t neglect the needs of those you love. With Pluto, planet of passion, linked with Mercury today you could all too easily turn people against you.
sagittarius,Today’s full moon demands that you are more positive in your outlook, and in your actions. You cannot afford to waste time any more time weighing up the pros and cons – you need to get things done, and get them done fast.
sagittarius,Employers and other authority figures will look on you kindly over the next 48 hours. If you are a typical Sag they will most likely delight in your larger-than-life character and flamboyant ways, but try not to take it to extremes.
sagittarius,No matter what seems to go wrong during the early part of the week you must not lose your temper and you must not doubt that you will eventually succeed. Maybe the planets are testing you to see if you have matured.
sagittarius,There is so much you still want to do and over the next few days you will get the opportunity to get on and do it. You will reach your goals more quickly and more effectively, of course, if you join forces with like-minded people. ,sagittarius,No matter what certain people may be telling you there is every chance that you will taste success over the next few days. But it’s only a chance, it’s not guaranteed. Get up and out and make things happen. Be amazing.
sagittarius,Over the next few days many of the things you have been worrying about will resolve themselves in your favor. If you’ve got a spare minute, look back over the past few months and work out where you went wrong. It’s never too late to learn.
sagittarius,You may not enjoy what you have to do over the next 48 hours but you know you have no choice, so get yourself in gear and get it done. Once it is out of the way you can devote yourself to more pleasurable activities over the weekend.
sagittarius,Try to focus on what you have in common with other people rather than on what divides you. The current cosmic picture is magnifying differences and making arguments more likely, but don’t forget you always have free will.
sagittarius,For quite some time now you have been content to let others decide where you will go and what you will do. That must now change. Demand total and utter freedom for yourself this weekend – and then do something useful with it.
sagittarius,You will start something new this week, something you hope will bring you the success and recognition you know you deserve. However, be warned that once you start you must go all the way to the end. It’s a serious commitment. ,sagittarius,Don’t let yourself be talked into doing anything you don’t feel comfortable with today. You may find yourself under pressure from partners and relatives to do things that feel wrong or unnatural. Resist, even at the risk of starting a feud.
sagittarius,Are your ideas touched by genius? Some may say so, while others say you are mad. But who cares what other people think? It’s what you want that matters and today you will be inspired to go your own way and do your own thing – again.
sagittarius,Jupiter in the career area of your chart means you will attract the attention of people in positions of power, and for all the right reasons. If they like what they see you could soon be moving up in the world – if that’s what you want. ,sagittarius,Some of life’s lessons are easier to learn than others and if you bear that thought in mind today it may make a setback of some kind easier to accept. Any lessons you learn now will pay for themselves before the month is through.
sagittarius,Any doubts you may have had about what you should be doing with your life will disappear today. At last you know which road you should be following. At last you know how to make your life both more secure and more exciting.
sagittarius,The Sun in Leo makes you more open to alternative ways of thinking and what happens this weekend will change your outlook in some way. Could it be that some of the values you have always taken for granted are not so valuable after all? ,sagittarius,Go out into the world and show everyone that you are the best at what you do. Whatever you want out of life you will find a way to get it, but you must act now. Also, act as if you cannot fail – a positive attitude always helps.
sagittarius,For some strange reason you seem to believe that you are not really good enough to compete at the highest level, but nothing could be further from the truth. You have so much talent at your disposal and you MUST now do something with it.
sagittarius,If you want to bring something new into your life you will have to make room for it by getting rid of something old. That is the message of the stars today and if you follow it there is no limit to what you can accomplish.
sagittarius,The most important thing today is that you control your tendency to go to extremes, otherwise some sort of accident is likely to occur. An affair of the heart may be going well but if you start acting crazy you may scare them off.
sagittarius,Someone will come to your rescue over the next 24 hours and do what has to be done with no questions asked and no thought of reward. You should be grateful to have friends as good as this – make sure you don’t take them for granted. ,sagittarius,Use your imagination and visualize what it is you most want to accomplish and what kind of person you most want to be. Don’t let the critics and cynics hold you back by saying that certain things cannot be done. You can do anything!,sagittarius,Act as if the eyes of the world are on you this weekend. Make sure everything you do is dynamic. If you make the right impression you will attract the attention of important people, the kind of people who can make your dreams come true.
sagittarius,Good news will come your way very soon, giving you every reason to celebrate, but don’t go over the top because what happens later in the week will put it in perspective and make you realize there are still important tasks to be done.
sagittarius,Some people may criticize you for refusing to change your ways but over the next few days they will realize that you were right to do so. Chopping and changing ultimately leads nowhere. It is your fixity of purpose that will bring you success. ,sagittarius,According to the planets you have been worrying for no good reason about something you thought mattered a lot but which in fact is of no importance at all. Which just goes to show that even a wise Sag can be fooled now and again.
sagittarius,You are worrying about issues and situations that are not worth the effort. Today’s Sun-Jupiter link promises that wherever you go and whatever you do things will work out well, so quit fretting and enjoy all the good things in life. ,sagittarius,As far as your money situation is concerned things may have to get worse before they get better. The good news is that the tide will turn by the start of next week and, looking back, you will realize it was all for your own good. ,sagittarius,Success is coming but you will have to wait a few more weeks before the breakthrough you have been expecting finally comes about. The good news is that the longer you have to wait the bigger the rewards you will receive. Be patient.
sagittarius,If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, but at what cost? The planets warn you may have to sacrifice one thing in order to gain another and it is important that you sit down and think it through. Is it worth it?,sagittarius,You of all people should know that going to extremes is rarely a good idea but according to the planets you have forgotten that moderation is the key to happiness and need something to jog your memory. Here it comes now. ,sagittarius,You may have only limited control over what other people say and do but you have total control over what you say and do. If you keep that thought in mind over the next few days you are less likely to fall out over trivial issues. ,sagittarius,Mars in your fellow Fire sign of Leo boosts your energy and helps you get things done but other influences warn you must not take anything for granted. When making social and travel plans make sure you consult loved ones at every stage.
sagittarius,It’s time for a clear out. It’s time to get rid of all your old junk. And not just physical junk, but mental and emotional junk too. The more you get rid of now the more space you will have for the things, and people, that matter.
sagittarius,The influence of Uranus in your chart means it is a waste of time trying to work out what is going to happen next. All you can do is go with the flow and trust that fate will steer you in the right direction – somehow it always does.
sagittarius,There can be no more playing around – you must make a decision and you must make it now. It won’t be easy and not everyone will approve, but you realize if you don’t act now you may never get the chance again, so get cracking.
sagittarius,If you make sure that powerful people know you exist this weekend you might just be rewarded with a salary raise or even a promotion. Even if that does not happen you will at least get your name and face recognized. You’re on the way up.
sagittarius,A recent attraction or affair was no doubt a lot of fun but now you need to ask yourself if it is going to be a long-term thing. If not, you need to let the other person know. Don’t keep them hanging on for something that is not there. ,sagittarius,Your loyalties will be tested this week, both at home and at work. Somehow you will have to find a way to keep everyone happy, but don’t just tell others what you think they want to hear – you could be way off the mark.
sagittarius,Mars and Uranus join forces across the most dynamic angles of your chart today, which among other things means you are in the mood to change your life for the better. A change of employment is possible and maybe a change of location too. ,sagittarius,You will have to spell things out in the simplest of terms for other people today. It would be nice if everyone were as quick on the uptake as you but they are not so you have no choice but to repeat your message until it sinks in. ,sagittarius,You need to make more of the skills and talents you were born with. No matter how ambitious you think you are you must be even more of a go-getter and self-starter between now and the end of the year. Use your imagination.
sagittarius,You may be a loner by nature but you must make an effort to get along with colleagues and acquaintances over the next few days. It may not always be possible to like certain people but that does not mean you cannot work with them.
sagittarius,You need to be more assertive and ambitious and this weekend’s eclipse will assist you. This is one of the most positive times of the year for you, so stop complaining that you never get the breaks and get out there and break some records.
sagittarius,Use the power of today’s solar eclipse, and Jupiter in the career area of your chart, to get yourself noticed by the people who matter. You don’t want to miss out because you are too shy or too timid. Make sure everyone knows your name.
sagittarius,You know a good thing when you see it and what you see today will get your mind racing. How can you make it work for you? How can you make it pay? Don’t let others tell you it’s selfish to think that way – it’s just common sense.
sagittarius,Try not to be so self-critical. If something has not worked out the way you expected it to, well, that’s just the way it is. On this occasion you may have failed but it’s all good experience and next time you’ll get it right. Move on. ,sagittarius,The way you react to problems of a partnership nature is of the utmost importance today. If you criticize others too harshly then you must expect to make yourself unpopular – and most likely make matters worse. Strive to see the good in everyone.
sagittarius,You may have strong views on controversial topics but the planets warn this is not the right time to make an issue of them. Wait until the Sun moves in your favor on the 23rd – then you can do your bit to save the world.
sagittarius,A dispute of some kind may be upsetting but come the middle of next week the cosmic picture will look very different indeed. It seems this is one of those occasions when the air needs to be cleared so everyone involved can move on. ,sagittarius,Arguments of one sort or another are likely this week, so be careful you don’t open your mouth and put both feet in it. You have a tendency to speak first and worry about what you have said later. Okay, correction, you don’t worry at all. ,sagittarius,Don’t worry too much if you are still waiting impatiently for things to happen because what occurs over the next few days will kick-start the rest of your year. Be quick, be bold and, above all, believe in the people you call your friends.
sagittarius,You seem a bit anxious at the moment, especially on the home front where bickering among loved ones is getting you down. Fortunately, the Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will usher in a more positive phase – and not a moment too soon.
sagittarius,You need to get along with other people now, because you will only achieve what you hope to achieve if you join forces with those who share your aims and ambitions. There will be no limits if you work as part of a team. ,sagittarius,You have a great deal of emotional energy at your disposal now and you must use it wisely. The last thing you want is to find yourself bickering with partners and loved ones for no good reason. Always aim for your highest ideal.
sagittarius,What happens over the next few days will convince you that the time is ripe to make a play for power. It is, of course, possible that you will go too far or expect too much but rather that than you make no effort at all.
sagittarius,You cannot change other people but you can change yourself, so stop trying to make others see sense and start seeing your own life in a more positive and progressive light. It should be easy now to get rid of the old and bring in the new.
sagittarius,You will be remarkably adventurous this coming week and will take any risk if you think the rewards will be worth it. Creatively and romantically anything is possible for you now, so identify what it is you most desire, then go out and get it. ,sagittarius,Always check the facts, both in your personal life and at work. The planets warn you must not take anything you see or hear at face value over the next few days, not even if it comes from a trusted source. If you do you may regret it.
sagittarius,With Mars and Jupiter, your ruler, on your side at the moment others are sure to look up to you and follow your lead. Which might do wonders for your ego but do you actually know where you want to be going and why?,sagittarius,You know that if you take a certain course of action you are likely to regret it in the long-term, so why are you still pushing ahead? No doubt it has something to do with your stubborn nature — you just cannot accept you might be wrong. ,sagittarius,By all means try to impress people, especially people who can help with your ambitions, but don’t go too far and claim you can deliver results that are really way beyond you. Even a Sag has limits – know them and stay within them.
sagittarius,You seem extremely pleased with yourself at the moment, and with good reason. You have at last found what it is you should be doing with your life and are in the process of making magnificent plans. Make sure you think them through.
sagittarius,You must defend your beliefs, and fight for them if necessary. The planets indicate that someone will challenge the way you look at the world over the next 48 hours and if you don’t meet the challenge you they will win by default.
sagittarius,You need to stand up, make yourself known and take charge of whatever situation is causing you and other people so much anguish. What happens over the next few days will give you the chance to assert yourself, but in a way that everyone respects.
sagittarius,Cosmic activity in one of the more open and outgoing areas of your chart urges you to have a good time socially but other aspects warn that authority figures still expect you to deliver on what you have promised. Work now, play later.
sagittarius,Your confidence may be a bit low at the moment but that does not mean you should withdraw from the world. On the contrary, you need to get yourself back into the fray and show those who doubt you that you never give in. ,sagittarius,Pace yourself sensibly today and be selective in the tasks you take on. If you throw yourself at each little challenge that comes your way now you may not have enough energy left to tackle the really big challenges that are on the horizon. ,sagittarius,You may say that you don’t care what the world thinks of you but deep down you do and cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will give you the chance to impress over the next few days. The world thinks highly of you. ,sagittarius,Do something dramatic today, something that impresses those in positions of power. The only thing that seems to be holding you back is that you are not sure you want to be the centre of attention. You’re a Sagittarius – since when have you been so modest! ,sagittarius,You may not understand why you feel a certain way but you do and it is valid. You are more sensitive to what goes on around you than you let on, so maybe you need to shut off outside influences for a while. But only a while.
sagittarius,You won’t care what you say or do over the next few days so long as it has the desired effect – and that is to shock. When discussing serious issues you will often take an opposing viewpoint just to get the argument going. ,sagittarius,You did not arrive at your present position by chance: it is all part of the grand design. Once you accept that fact you won’t worry so much about what went wrong in the past or what the future might bring. You are under divine protection.
sagittarius,What happens over the next 24 hours will take most people by surprise, but not you. You have sensed for quite some time that a big change was coming, so mentally and emotionally you will be ready for it. Help those who take it hard. ,sagittarius,For some strange reason you have got it into your head that you have fallen short of what was expected of you. That’s nonsense. In one or two things you could have done better but overall you are still streets ahead of your rivals. ,sagittarius,You will be offered something worth having today but will be reluctant to accept because you are not sure if it is the right thing to do. The only thing that really matters is if it benefits you, so stop worrying and take it.
sagittarius,This is a fortunate time for you and whatever you do over the next few days will be a success. It will be even more of a success if you don’t worry too much about how much it is likely to cost you. Money is not an issue.
sagittarius,It may be difficult to choose between two equally tempting possibilities but choose you must or you may be left with no choice at all. If the choice is between something personal and something professional, choose the personal, it will be more rewarding. ,sagittarius,Anyone who tries to take liberties this week is in for a shock. You won’t take nonsense from anyone, not even from those who think they have the right to order you around. Some say that your bark is worse than your bite. Prove them wrong. ,sagittarius,Get rid of all feelings of regret and remorse. There are some things you did that you now wish you had not, and there are some things you did not do that you now wish you had, but so what? Live in the day and for the moment.
sagittarius,There are a lot of challenges coming your way over the next few days but you will come through unscathed. Even the most testing trial can be turned into a triumph if you show the right attitude. Always believe you will succeed.
sagittarius,Your confidence may be high at the moment but you are advised not to take too much for granted, because what you gain through confidence today could so easily be lost through over-confidence when the Sun changes signs on Friday. ,sagittarius,You would like nothing better than to close your eyes and ears and live in your own little world for a while. So why don’t you? The Sun’s imminent move into the most sensitive area of your chart means you can be as anti-social as you please. ,sagittarius,Don’t be surprised if you want to be by yourself more than usual today and over the weekend. Others may find it hard to accept but you must not allow them to persuade you to go places and do things you would rather avoid.
sagittarius,You may not be able to explain why you feel the way you do but that does not mean you must deny it. Your feelings are genuine and worthy of respect, so be proud of them and don’t make excuses – they’re not necessary.
sagittarius,Even if you enjoy physical activity it might be wise to do a bit less exercise this week, especially if you are the kind of Sag who tends to overdo things. The full moon urges you to focus more on brain than brawn over the next few days. ,sagittarius,You may be impatient to get things done, especially at work, but take care that in your haste to get ahead you don’t neglect the needs of those you love. The last thing you want is to turn people against you just because you are in a hurry. ,sagittarius,It may seem to others that you are aiming too high but you know that the higher you aim the more you are likely to achieve. There is no limit to what you can accomplish now, so believe in yourself and make those “impossible” things happen. ,sagittarius,Your confidence may be at a low ebb at the moment but this is only a passing phase, so don’t get too despondent. If you don’t feel like mixing socially, that’s okay – just find a quiet place where you can be alone with your thoughts. ,sagittarius,A positive attitude is essential today. Whatever issues you have to face and whatever problems you have to solve the fact is you are big enough and tough enough to deal with them. The right frame of mind will get you the right result – always.

sagittarius,If someone in a position of authority acts unnaturally nice to you this weekend that’s a sure sign they are after something. Don’t kid yourself that they have your best interests at heart because the truth is they are thinking only of themselves. ,sagittarius,The message of the stars now is that you must not give up hope. Think positively and act confidently in all situations and you won’t go far wrong. Success depends on many things but by far the most important is belief in yourself.
sagittarius,It may seem as if time is running out and that the harder you work the less you seem to complete. But is that such a big deal? You of all people should know that it’s quality work that counts. Do what you can and do it well.
sagittarius,You will no longer be content to play a minor or supporting role in your work or career. The fact is you have more talent in your little finger than many of your colleagues have in their whole bodies, so make sure you get noticed.
sagittarius,The more you give in to others’ demands today the more they will expect of you, so put your foot down and leave no one in any doubt that you are not the sort who can be intimidated. There is though one deserving case you should help – yourself!,sagittarius,Listen to what your inner voice tells you over the next 24 hours and ignore everything else. If you let certain people persuade you that their aims should be your aims you will find yourself heading in a direction that takes you away from your goals.
sagittarius,Others appear to believe you have something to hide and you do seem to be acting rather suspiciously. Whatever your secret happens to be there is no point hiding it because they will find out sooner or later. Why not confess and get it over with? ,sagittarius,Speak your mind and stir things up a bit. You are not the kind of person who can keep your mouth shut when there are serious injustices going on. The more criticism you attract this weekend the better – it means you are having an effect. ,sagittarius,You must not allow yourself to be intimidated by people who raise their voice whenever they want something. Someone you have to deal with this week may seem threatening but deep down they are rather weak. Stand tall and call their bluff. ,sagittarius,One-to-one relationships are about to go through a rather delicate phase but the good news is it won’t last for long and nothing bad will come of it. The approaching new moon means you need to feel more and think less. Follow your instincts.

You are still moving in the right direction. ,sagittarius,Today’s new moon in the most thoughtful area of your chart means you need to find time to think about all the important things that have happened in your life over the past six months or so. Then, of course, you need to learn from them. ,sagittarius,You need a challenge and you are about to get it. Most likely it will be the kind of challenge that you cannot handle on your own, so it will encourage you to seek help from like-minded people. You cannot be self-sufficient all the time.
sagittarius,You may not have been your usual sunny self recently but that will now change. Today’s link between Mercury, planet of the mind, and Jupiter, your ruler, will inspire you to act big again – and no-one does it bigger and better than Sagittarius! ,sagittarius,What you gain this weekend will more than make up for what you have lost, so cheer up and don’t act as if the world is coming to an end.

With Mercury about change direction and move into your sign you will find it easy to work out what others are up to and can adjust your own actions accordingly. ,sagittarius,You no doubt believe that all things are possible, that you can overcome any and every challenge that comes your way, and you may be right.

Steer clear of negative people and negative ideas and focus only on the good things in life – plenty of them are coming your way.

What that something is only you can know for sure but whatever it is this is the one and only chance you will get, so don’t waste it.
sagittarius,If someone offers you something for nothing today reject it immediately. You of all people should know there is no such thing as a free lunch. You should also be able to sense that your luck is on the turn and that you don’t need assistance.
sagittarius,You have come through a lot in recent weeks but now that the Sun is moving through your own sign you can look back and see there were reasons for everything that happened. Put doubts and fears behind you and act as if all things are possible.
sagittarius,No matter how anxious you may be about a certain situation you won’t make it better by worrying. Stay calm and identify exactly what the problem is, then come up with a plan to take care of it. It’s unlikely to be as bad as you fear.
sagittarius,Ignore those who seem to enjoy preaching doom and disaster.

Today’s full moon will in some way or other impress on you the urgency to get one! ,sagittarius,The Sun in your sign means there is no holding you back.

It may not be entirely true but if you succeed they will certainly get a share of the spoils. ,sagittarius,Others may offer to do things for you over the next 48 hours but if you are smart you will do them yourself.

Who is going to stop you? Who is going to complain? If it feels good then do it. You can get back to the serious stuff later. ,sagittarius,You may be rather emotional today, even if you are the kind of Sagittarius who usually treats life as one big joke. Once in a while though it is good to let it all out, so make a noise if you have to. You will feel better for it.
sagittarius,You may be more emotional than usual but you are also more sensitive to others people’s problems and issues. Being the nice guy you are you will want to help in some way. Charity work and other idealistic activities will go well for you this weekend. ,sagittarius,Someone will rub you up the wrong way this week and if you are sensible you will turn your back and walk away.

If possible, move the conversation in other directions. ,sagittarius,Try to avoid people who always seem to be talking you down. If you want to feel good about yourself today spend time with your family and those friends who like you for who and what you are, not some impossible ideal of what you should be. ,sagittarius,For too long you have kept certain aims and ambitions to yourself – now you must let everyone know what it is you desire and what you are going to do to get it. Most people will be supportive. The few who are not you can safely ignore. ,sagittarius,Look out for your own interests. You have done your bit for the good of the community, now do something for yourself for a change. Today’s new moon in your sign promises great things will happen over the next 24 hours. You deserve your success.
sagittarius,If you face a choice between making your own life more comfortable and helping out someone who is not as fortunate as you this weekend you must choose the latter course. Invest in friendship now and you will get it back many times over later on.
sagittarius,Times are not as bad as some people would have you believe and what happens today and during the early part of the week will convince you that they are, in fact, rather good. Adopt a positive attitude and positive things will occur.

The Sun in your sign will for the most part protect you from harm, so why worry? ,sagittarius,You might like to remind yourself today that material and professional success is not the most important thing in your life. What matters most now is that you take the opportunity to improve your domestic situation. Work can wait but loved ones cannot. ,sagittarius,The Sun remains in your sign just a few more days, so make the most of it and make sure you use each and every opportunity that comes your way.

You should have zero tolerance with people who want to do you harm, especially those who plan to get rich at your expense. ,sagittarius,The Sun leaves your birth sign this week but other influences indicate that you will still be extremely active. The more you are on the move and meeting new people over the next few days the more you will get out of life.

Don’t be suspicious of passion, least of all your own. ,sagittarius,Turn your attention to ways you can make your everyday routine less exhausting. For starters you can find ways to get work colleagues to shoulder more of the burden. Just because you can do most tasks better than them does not mean you should do everything.
sagittarius,Whatever else you do or do not do over the next 24 hours, don’t follow the herd. Go your own way, do your own thing and, if certain people don’t like it, take that as a sign you are on the right track. You make the rules. ,sagittarius,Try not to fall out with a friend over the next 24 hours because it may be a long time before you get the chance to make up again.

That cynicism you have been feeling will fade away and be replaced by an understanding that it takes all sorts to make a world. ,sagittarius,You might find it hard to make much of an effort over the next few days but why should that be such a bad thing? With the Sun linking to your ruling planet Jupiter this week other people will happily do things for you. Let them.

sagittarius,Be careful what decisions you make between now and the Sun’s change of signs on Wednesday, because your judgment in financial matters could be poor. Invest your money only in projects where there is a guaranteed return. Better still, keep your cash in your pocket.

If you enjoy meeting new people you will be in your element this week, and for several weeks to come.
sagittarius,Now that the Sun is moving into one of the more positive areas of your chart you will find it easier to make your own decisions and your first decision must be to distance yourself from someone who annoys you. Act as if they no longer exist.
sagittarius,Friends will surprise and delight you with sudden invitations and suggestions for having a good time, so don’t plan your schedule in too much detail. Where your social life is concerned you must be ready to drop whatever you are doing and party. ,sagittarius,You may be a bit pessimistic about money matters at the moment but that’s no bad thing. The last thing you need now is to take some kind of gamble, because it’s unlikely to pay off. Keep your head down and keep your cash in your pocket.

Weigh up the evidence, then give your honest opinion. And stand well back!,sagittarius,You won’t take kindly to criticism this week, especially when it seems designed to make you look stupid or feel inferior.

If you’re going to lose it, lose it big!,sagittarius,As mind planet Mercury moves in your favor today you will at last be confident enough to take a risk of some kind. But don’t get carried away and start taking risks all over the place. That’s just asking for trouble.

sagittarius,You may be somewhat annoyed that friends and loved ones are depending on you to get them out of a fix, but you will do it anyway because that’s the kind of person you are. Be sure to reward yourself with something good afterwards. ,sagittarius,You seem to prefer the dream world inside your head to the real world around you. That’s not necessarily a bad thing but what happens next will remind you that the real world is not such a bad place – in fact it can be a lot of fun. ,sagittarius,You get what you want more often than not but sometimes, like now, it pays to let others take the lead. There are a lot of pitfalls on the path you have chosen to take, so let others go first so it’s not you who falls down them. ,sagittarius,You are sure to come up with some brilliant ideas over the next 48 hours, but no matter how brilliant they may be they will be worthless if you don’t do something with them.

sagittarius,If you recently gave advice to someone, and if that advice turned out to be wrong, you had best say sorry and make amends. The cosmic picture is a bit tense at the moment, so try not to give others an excuse to get annoyed with you.
sagittarius,Be fair in your dealings and don’t hesitate to give others the benefit of the doubt if they stray from the straight and narrow. A new love affair is possible this week, or maybe an existing relationship will be more fun than it has been of late. ,sagittarius,It might be a good idea to keep your thoughts to yourself today. You may be bursting to tell the world what you know but the planets warn there is a flaw in your understanding and if you speak too soon you could look silly. Check your facts.
sagittarius,You find it relatively easy to accept that different people see things in different ways and that’s good because one particular person has been acting rather strangely of late. Make it your business to understand them – then help them in any way you can. ,sagittarius,Someone you thought was a friend will show their true colors and try to convert you to their way of thinking today and you won’t be pleased. Let them know that in future they must only give their opinions when they are asked for – in other words, never! ,sagittarius,Travel and social activities are well starred now and what happens in the run-up to the new moon on the 8th will make you realize how lucky you are to have certain people as friends. Go out of your way to be sociable and adventurous – even more so than usual!,sagittarius,You may have an excellent money-making idea but you would be wise to wait a day or two before going ahead with it. According to the planets there is a danger you are ignoring certain facts and figures – and if you get it wrong it could be costly. ,sagittarius,The more firmly you have planted your feet on the ground the more confidently you will push your head into the clouds this week. It is okay to dream. It is okay to imagine outrageous things. In fact, the planets demand it of you.
sagittarius,There are a lot of tall stories doing the rounds at the moment and the only way to separate fact from fiction is to ignore what people tell you and follow your instincts. You don’t need to listen to others when your inner voice knows the answers already.
sagittarius,You can still make a name for yourself but only if you are prepared to give up certain things that are holding you back. Anything that takes up too much of your time, or depletes your bank balance, must be got rid of. Be ruthless with yourself. ,sagittarius,You have made a lot of sacrifices in recent weeks and over the next few days you will get your reward. Jupiter, your ruler and planet of good fortune, will make it easy for you to connect with people in positions of power. Tell them what you need.
sagittarius,What happened to your way with words? You seem to have completely dried up and are at a loss to know how or why it has happened. You will find your voice again in a few days time but, for now, be the strong, silent type. ,sagittarius,Your social life will blossom over the next few days and you will be so in demand that you have to turn some invitations down. You will get on best with people in whose company you feel totally relaxed. Keep life calm and stress-free.
sagittarius,You can, if you wish, ignore a problem of some kind but if you do it will return with a vengeance later on. Relationship issues, in particular, must be dealt with promptly. The longer you leave them the harder it will be to kiss and make up.
sagittarius,Someone who envies your popularity and abilities will say something rather hurtful today and you should take it as a sign that you are on the right track. They obviously feel threatened, maybe even inferior, so don’t change a thing you are doing.
sagittarius,It may seem as if certain events are no longer under your control but nothing bad will happen so long as you stay calm and think logically. The important thing is to not let your heart overrule your head. Emotions will just get in the way. ,sagittarius,If you do nothing else over the next 24 hours at least aim high, both at home and at work, because there is no limit to how much can be accomplished. A little bit of self-belief will go a long way. Think how far a lot might take you! ,sagittarius,Minor disagreements could easily get out of hand over the next two or three days, so think before you speak and, if someone says something you do not agree with, don’t make an issue of it. Is it really that important? Probably not. ,sagittarius,It may at times seem as if the whole world is against you but nothing could be further from the truth. All that is happening is that you are more touchy than usual – the smallest little thing sets you off. Stay calm, breathe deeply and count to ten. ,sagittarius,If someone in a position of authority places restrictions on you over the next 48 hours the best thing you can do is to accept it. It may be unfair but there is nothing you can do to change the situation, so bend with the breeze – for now.
sagittarius,Some people delight in rubbing you up the wrong way and the upcoming full moon suggests you will have to deal with at least one such individual over the next few days. Promise yourself now that no matter what they might say or do you won’t overreact.
sagittarius,The planets warn you need to accept that in one area of your life at least you are out of your depth and must concede defeat. But it’s no big deal. A Sag is rarely down for long and you will bounce back bigger and better than ever. ,sagittarius,It will be easy to jump to conclusions today and chances are they will be wrong. Wait a while before deciding if a friend or colleague has let you down. Later in the week you will realize that you got the wrong end of the stick.

There is so much gossip doing the rounds at the moment that it is sure to end in tears. ,sagittarius,Usually you like to hear both sides of every story but today you will go right the other way and come down strongly in favor of one particular viewpoint. You won’t beat about the bush – you will say your piece and have done with it. ,sagittarius,You will find it easier to come and go as you please today and over the weekend, which will be very much to your benefit. Once you get over the fear that others might disapprove of your actions there is nothing that can hold you back.
sagittarius,You don’t always trust your intuition as much as you should but over the next 48 hours you must listen to that small voice in your head because it has something important to tell you. If you don’t heed its message you may regret it later on.
sagittarius,Stop complaining that you have so many problems and start looking for solutions. You are more likely to find them if you look outside the usual areas for the answers you need. And get some input from loved ones. You don’t have to face life alone.
sagittarius,Today’s cosmic activity urges you to spell out in plain and simple language what it is you need to be done. If you leave any room for doubt you can be sure that someone will get it wrong and cause all kinds of unnecessary mayhem.

sagittarius,You need to find a positive outlet for all that energy you’ve got inside you. Creative activities and affairs of the heart will go well over the next few days, so focus on these and avoid anything of a negative nature. Be bold but stay loose as well.

sagittarius,It may seem as if other people are ganging up on you for no good reason but chances are it’s mostly in your mind. Try not to take the situation too seriously and it won’t be long before it dissolves into nothing, because that’s what it is. ,sagittarius,There is no longer any need to be cautious. Others can hesitate if they wish but you can sense this is a time to take chances and make changes. As Mars moves into your sign so you will be on the move too – and you will move fast.
sagittarius,Someone will feel the edge of your tongue today, and no doubt they will deserve it, but later on you may wish you had not been quite so scathing. Don’t let yourself feel bad about it but do let them know you don’t hold a grudge.
sagittarius,You clearly have a lot on your mind at the moment and the last thing you need is to be bombarded with ideas and plans you know nothing about and care even less for. Keep yourself to yourself over the next 24 hours.
sagittarius,Why does no one seem to be taking your advice? Because they want you to mind your own business! Take the hint and back off a bit. If your advice is as good as you think it is you will get the chance to give it again later on.
sagittarius,You like to keep your standards high but sometimes you can expect too much of yourself. Today’s cosmic influences suggest that you need to let go of unrealistic expectations, both of yourself and of other people. Just be yourself and be happy. ,sagittarius,It is time to get serious about what it is you want to accomplish in life and what it is you need to give to the world. Never doubt that you have something to offer. You’re a Sagittarius – which means you were born to make a difference.
sagittarius,Make a loved one feel special this weekend. Reach out and remind them how much you value what they have done for you. If there have been any disputes between you now is the ideal time to kiss and make up. Make the first move. ,sagittarius,You have this vague idea that something is not right but you can’t put your finger on what it might be. It will continue to nag at you over the next few days but, ultimately, there is little to worry about. Like most problems, it’s largely in your mind.
sagittarius,You will encounter some kind of resistance over the next 24 hours, most likely from an authority figure. Should you hit back or should you give in? Just this once the latter may be the smarter course. Live to fight another day.
sagittarius,You may not have the qualifications or the experience that your rivals possess but you do have the priceless ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. The more fixed others are in their ways the more likely it is you will win. ,sagittarius,It may seem as if you are being held back from following your dream but don’t worry because in a matter of days you will be free to do as you please. All the delays and frustrations of recent weeks will soon be a thing of the past. ,sagittarius,Don’t get discouraged if what you have been working on these past few weeks does not seem to be making much progress. Keep plugging away and sooner or later you will get the breakthrough your efforts deserve. Never give up and never give in. ,sagittarius,Although certain events may have upset you a bit there is no point dwelling on them because in a matter of days they will no longer matter. The Sun’s change of signs on the 20th will cheer you up no end and what went before will soon be forgotten. ,sagittarius,Life is good and about to get even better. With the Sun moving into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend your confidence will soar, as will your courage and your willingness to take risks – a combination that is sure to lead to success.
sagittarius,Creative activities of all kinds will go well over the coming week, so don’t hold back. Whatever your dreams may be now is time to get serious about them. Visualize what it is you would like to accomplish, then take steps to make it happen.
sagittarius,You have made a lot of sacrifices of late but now that the Sun is moving in your favor again you can and you must make up for lost time. Do only what interests you personally. You have earned the right to be your own boss.
sagittarius,For several weeks you have been quietly planning your next big move and now that the planets are moving in your favor again you can get to work and start making things happen. You will have a lot of fun proving the doubters and critics wrong. ,sagittarius,Don’t tell lies to cover your tracks – just own up and get it over with. It won’t be the first time you’ve been caught out, nor will it be the last, so admit you made a mistake and accept your punishment. Actually, others will be quite forgiving. ,sagittarius,Deal harshly with people who try to halt your progress. But be reasonable with people who are simply too slow to get out of your way. Not everyone possesses your energy and enthusiasm, so make allowances for slower minds and bodies. ,sagittarius,Don’t gamble with your resources, still less with the resources of other people. You may be tempted to put your money, and maybe your reputation, at risk but the odds are very much against you. Just this once Sag, play safe. ,sagittarius,Certain people will present gossip as facts this weekend and if you act on what they say you will most likely regret it later. Also, be careful what information you reveal about yourself because it could be you who later gets gossiped about. ,sagittarius,Your desire to travel and explore will take you all over the place this week and you may even get lost for a while. But that won’t worry you in the slightest. Your sense of adventure is so strong that taking chances turns you on big time.
sagittarius,Don’t hide in the shadows – get out there and show the world what you are capable of. Don’t worry that your rivals may have more experience. You have something they can never compete with: the kind of enthusiasm that moves mountains.
sagittarius,If there is something you want then go out and get it. Cosmic activity in one of the most dynamic areas of your chart means that others are unlikely to try to stop you – they can sense it could be a rather costly, and painful, error. ,sagittarius,Mars in your sign gives you the energy and the ambition to make things happen but you also need to take other people’s needs into account. The planets indicate that everyone can be and will be a winner if you get the balance right.
sagittarius,You need to take decisive action, both for your own sake and for the sake of those who depend on you. If you see an opening today – and you will – you must exploit it for all it is worth. If you don’t, your rivals most surely will! ,sagittarius,It is part of your role in life to provoke reactions and break up the status quo but the planets warn you could go too far this weekend and unleash forces that cannot be controlled. Think before you act and maybe, just this once, don’t act at all.
sagittarius,There is magic in the air at the moment, the kind of magic that makes all things possible, and it will get stronger as the week continues. Creatively and romantically everything will come easy to you. Even the smallest effort will bring spectacular results. ,sagittarius,No matter how difficult certain people may have been in recent weeks they will want to be nice to you today. Most likely they are fed up arguing about things they see of no importance. This is a good day to make up and move on.
sagittarius,You may be feeling more assertive then usual but today’s Sun-Pluto link warns this is probably not the best of times to take risks, especially with money. You may win big to begin with but by the end of the day you could be a serious loser.
sagittarius,What looks like a setback may in fact be the opposite, so don’t be hasty in making decisions. A few days from now you will look back and see that you were being pushed in a direction that is right for you. Let the universe guide you. ,sagittarius,What happens this weekend may seem like a setback but it can be made to work in your favor. All you have to do to turn the situation around is think outside the mental boundaries you have imposed on yourself. For Sags, there are no limits. ,sagittarius,You will find it easy to be assertive over the next few days. The Sun’s journey through the most dynamic area of your chart will give your confidence a boost and make it easy to let others know how ambitious you are. ,sagittarius,You may not have any doubts about what you are doing but others are most likely not so confident. You will have to use all your considerable energy and enthusiasm to win them over today. Self-belief is the main ingredient of success.
sagittarius,The planets indicate that you need to be flexible and you need to be willing to make compromises. It’s not as hard as it sounds and if you make an effort the rewards will be considerable. Life is only a trial if you make it a trial.
sagittarius,If others see you are uncomfortable with the situation you find yourself in they will go out of their way to make you feel even worse. If, however, they see you don’t care they will be less inclined to make an issue of it. Brazen it out. ,sagittarius,Nothing seems to faze you at the moment, most likely because you can sense that something good is going to happen over the next few weeks. Others can waste their time worrying if they so wish but you enjoy life for what it is. ,sagittarius,Cosmic activity in your fellow Fire sign of Aries helps you to believe that all things are possible, that nothing is beyond you – but it won’t last much longer. This is still a great time for creative endeavors and affairs of the heart, so get busy.
sagittarius,Someone will find out the hard way this weekend that you are not the sort to let an insult go unanswered. Having said which, try not to overreact. Some slights are so petty that they are really not worth getting worked up about.
sagittarius,Changes in your working environment will bring opportunities to move up in the world over the next few days and if you act fast you will see almost instant results. Don’t worry about what others might think, just get on with it.
sagittarius,If something you are working on is being held back in some way, don’t worry about it. The Sun’s move into the area of your chart that governs your work and wellbeing tomorrow will remove the obstruction and speed things up again.
sagittarius,The past few weeks have been a lot of fun but now you need to get serious, about some things at least. Work and wellbeing issues, in particular, may have been neglected and now it is time to restore the balance. Get more early nights!,sagittarius,You may be eager to get started on something new but you must realize that not everyone is as motivated as you. If others don’t seem interested in what you are doing today don’t try to force them. Their efforts will be half-hearted at best.
sagittarius,If, as is likely, you overdid it a bit in recent weeks you must now slow down and give your mental and physical batteries time to recharge. Put your health first today, tomorrow and over the weekend because there are more challenges to come. ,sagittarius,You enjoy being the odd one out and today you will deliberately do the opposite of what everyone else says should be done. Too many people nowadays don’t know how to think and act for themselves. Show them how it’s done – and do it with style.
sagittarius,You may be in a hurry to get things done but you must also take into consideration what those around you want, and don’t want, to do. Mars in your sign endows you with loads of energy but it does not guarantee you will use it correctly.
sagittarius,If you make a good job of routine matters over the next few days you will be able to focus on more interesting issues later on. Do not, repeat not, try to cut corners or get away with a second rate job. Your reputation is on the line! ,sagittarius,You may not care in the slightest whether or not the world at large approves of what you are doing but, having said that, it might be unwise to draw too much attention to your methods. It won’t hurt to be a bit secretive today. ,sagittarius,If you play to your strengths today there is precious little you won’t be able to do, either at home or at work. By all means try a new approach, but make sure it is within the framework of what you already know and do so well. ,sagittarius,Routine matters may be a bore but the planets indicate that if you do what is expected of you, both at home and at work, you will be well thought of and well rewarded. Even freedom-loving, freewheeling Sags have responsibilities they cannot avoid.
sagittarius,It may at times seem as if you are being swept along by forces over which you have no control, and to a certain extent it may be true, but you can always influence the way your life develops. Knowing what it is that you desire will help.
sagittarius,There is no point being too serious about life today. If loved ones and work colleagues expect you to knuckle down and work your way through whatever chores they’ve lined up for you they are going to be disappointed. If it’s not fun, you’re not interested.
sagittarius,Even if a relationship has turned a bit sour of late there is no reason why you should not be able to kiss and make up. You will, however, have to swallow your pride and make the first move, because they are every bit as stubborn as you.
sagittarius,Quit with the wishful thinking and knuckle down to some serious work. You will get through your chores a lot quicker over the coming week if you make an early start on them. In fact, start today. There’s no time like the present.
sagittarius,Try not to dwell too much on minor details. Every now and then you must make an effort to stand back from what you are doing and see the bigger picture. Remind yourself what it’s all for, then it will never be a chore.
sagittarius,Your emotions may be close to the surface today but that’s no bad thing. With Jupiter, your ruler, linked to the Sun you can afford to be open about how you feel – it won’t come back at you in a negative way. Be true to yourself. ,sagittarius,Few things in life come for free and you would be wise to keep that in mind over the next few days. Mars in your sign may tempt you to risk too much, too quickly but if you slow down and think things through you’ll be okay.
sagittarius,Someone you work with is behaving badly and it is clear there is no point trying to reason with them. All you can do is smile and let their anger pass over your head. It will annoy them even more if they see you don’t care! ,sagittarius,It will be easier to get along with people you work alongside over the next few days but that does not mean you should let your guard down. Make sure you don’t end up doing the lion’s share of the work. Learn to say “no”.
sagittarius,Your motives for doing something may not be the same as those you are working alongside, so once you have reached your joint goal this weekend you must dissolve the group and go your separate ways. Never let others control your life.
sagittarius,You will be unusually cautious as the new week begins. While others are acting as if nothing can possibly go wrong you will be looking at the facts and drawing less optimistic conclusions. Seems like you’re the only one who knows what’s going on.
sagittarius,Something you once had doubts about now seems to be the most obvious thing to do and if you follow your instincts today you will have the time of your life. Jupiter, your ruler, will protect you wherever you go and whatever you do.
sagittarius,It does not matter how tough you think you are, the simple fact is if you carry on at your current pace you will burn out before the end of the week. Decide what is important to you today and focus on that and that alone. ,sagittarius,You may think you are so far ahead of your rivals that they will never catch up with you but don’t be too sure. Over-overconfidence could be your undoing, especially if you are one of those Sags who find it hard to learn from their mistakes. ,sagittarius,The reason you are finding it difficult to get excited about your work is because you are not enjoying it. The fact is you get bored more easily than other people so you need to keep your activities as varied as possible. What can you vary today? ,sagittarius,It may be true that someone has taken advantage of you but don’t overreact. Chances are you are none the worse off for it, so let it pass. Next time, of course, you won’t be quite so trusting of certain people, and that’s a good thing.
sagittarius,Go out of your way to assist people in need over the next two or three days. Not only will it help them but it will make you feel good about yourself, and might even attract the attention of someone who rewards you for your generosity.
sagittarius,To some people it may look as if you are losing control but in reality what you are doing is letting go of things that are no longer of any use to you. Carry on with your big clearout – the less you possess the happier you will be. ,sagittarius,There are only so many hours in a day and you need to identify your priorities both at home and at work. Focus on important tasks only, especially if you are the kind of Sag who is easily distracted by shiny new things and interesting new people.
sagittarius,It may seem as if the world is against you but you know it isn’t true. Most likely you are just a bit depressed because your get up and go appears to have got up and gone. Don’t worry, you will be back to your best very soon. ,sagittarius,If you have been thinking of starting some kind of health or fitness kick, don’t think about it any longer – do it! Also, cut back on your commitments, both at home and at work. You are doing too many things for too many people.
sagittarius,Because the Sun is about to move into the partnership area of your chart you must expect others to become a bit more demanding over the next few days. Try to modify your own desires so as to accommodate those of partners, loved ones and colleagues.
sagittarius,The Sun’s change of signs today means you are at the halfway point of your solar year, making this a good time to look back and assess your progress so far. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have fallen short. Tomorrow is another day.
sagittarius,Today’s full moon in your sign is likely to play havoc with your plans and may even result in a temporary dip in your confidence. But it is only temporary, so don’t make a big issue of what happens or, more likely, what doesn’t happen.
sagittarius,Mars in your sign makes you believe there are no restrictions, that you can do what you please. To a certain extent that may be true but if you take it to extremes this week you could be on the receiving end of a painful lesson. ,sagittarius,Let the people who are most important to you know how much you care. Don’t worry if you struggle with words because with Venus about to move into the partnership area of your chart they will know instantly what you are trying to say.
sagittarius,You won’t convince others to follow your lead by bombarding them with facts and figures. The way to get them on your side is to appeal to their emotions, and the best way to do that is to inspire them with words that paint a picture.
sagittarius,This is probably not the best time to take risks that involve either your own or other people’s finances but, having said that, if you act on a hunch during the latter part of the day, it might pay off. The question is: do you feel lucky? ,sagittarius,Someone you work with resents your success and popularity and is planning to do something that will make you look bad. Now that you know that you can be on your guard and turn the tables on them. Then they will resent you even more! ,sagittarius,You will find it hard to get going today and if you are smart you won’t try to force yourself. Sometimes the best thing to do is to just sit back and let things happen, and that, it seems, is what you are being asked to do now. ,sagittarius,Put your own needs on hold this weekend and do whatever it is that friends and loved ones require of you. You will have to fit in with other people’s needs and wishes anyway, so you might as well do so as a matter of personal choice. ,sagittarius,No matter how certain you may be that your opinions are right and other people’s opinions are wrong, you must still take what they say seriously. Also, if you make an effort to see things from their point of view you may be surprised what you learn.
sagittarius,You will make some unusual new friends over the next few days. Chances are they will inspire you to broaden your horizons and look at life in exciting ways. As if you did not have enough excitement in your life already! ,sagittarius,Someone you meet on your travels could become hugely beneficial to you over the next few months. First impressions are always important, so greet them with a smile and make them feel welcome. Soon you will be the best of buddies. ,sagittarius,It may shock you to discover that someone you thought was a friend has in fact been plotting against you but the truth is there in black and white. Next time try not to be so easily taken in – a little suspicion can go a long way.
sagittarius,If something does not work out the way you expected you must resist the urge to get angry about it because that will just make matters worse, not least by making some important people wonder if you can be trusted to handle pressure situations.
sagittarius,If someone you consider a rival throws down a challenge today you won’t hesitate to pick it up. You may be a nice guy by nature but you have your pride too and some unlucky person is going to be on the receiving end of some serious Sag stick.
sagittarius,If someone you consider a rival throws down a challenge today you won’t hesitate to pick it up. You may be a nice guy by nature but you have your pride too and some unlucky person is going to be on the receiving end of some serious Sag stick.
sagittarius,You may be a nice guy by nature but over the next 24 hours you will realize that you need to get tough with certain people. It seems that friendly warnings have not done the trick, so now you must lay down the law – and mean it.
sagittarius,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Gemini means you may not see eye-to-eye with certain people today. What you need to remember though is that you won’t get far without their help, so make an effort to meet them halfway.
sagittarius,A dispute of some kind may get out of hand today but even if it does you are advised not to take it too seriously. What has caused this falling out? Most likely you have been taking each other just a touch too much for granted.
sagittarius,You are never afraid to go on the attack but the planets warn if you start a feud with someone today you may find that they are stronger and more ruthless than you imagined. You don’t have to back down but you do have to be sensible.
sagittarius,You are likely to be rather impulsive over the next 24 hours and it could cause problems if you make a wrong call. Remember, few things in life come for free and even those that do often turn out to be of only limited value.
sagittarius,Partnerships of all kinds are highlighted at the moment and there will be occasions when you have to deal with people whose aims and ambitions are the opposite of your own. Deal with them kindly but without giving up your independence. ,sagittarius,You may have cut corners and got away with it in the past but you won’t get away with it if you use those tactics this weekend. Play by the book both at home and at work and, if you don’t end up the winner, it’s no big deal.
sagittarius,There is no point trying to guess what other people are thinking this week because you will almost certainly get it wrong. If others want you to be in the know they will open up when they are ready. It’s your own thoughts you should be focusing on.
sagittarius,No matter what you say or do today there will be those who disapprove. Should that stop you from speaking or acting? Of course not. But be aware that certain individuals are looking for a chance to clip your wings. Don’t make it easy for them.
sagittarius,Put your ego to one side and recognize that, in some areas at least, other people know better than you. It would be foolish to ignore what loved ones tell you today just because you find it hard to accept that you still have things to learn. ,sagittarius,Saturn in your sign is making it difficult for you to get in the party spirit at the moment and when you see others having fun it makes you feel even worse. Don’t worry, this phase will pass and you will soon be smiling, and partying, again. ,sagittarius,Don’t worry if something you are planning looks like it will cost more than you budgeted for. You will find ways to get the extra cash, thanks to your typically Sagittarian positive outlook. You are a magnet for good fortune. ,sagittarius,What you need to recognize today is that happiness is not a place or a person but a state of mind. It is not what happens in your everyday life that matters but how you choose to react to it. And sometimes it’s best not to react at all.
sagittarius,According to the planets you need to worry a lot less and laugh a lot more. The simple fact is you are looking too far ahead and too far away. Happiness begins at home, so spend more quality time with those you really care about.
sagittarius,What seems so confusing now will seem ridiculously simple after the Sun’s change of signs early in the new week. More importantly, your mind will be receptive to ideas about how to improve your financial position. Invest for the long-term.
sagittarius,You may find it hard to believe that life is getting better but it is and what happens today will surely prove it. If you think positive at all times your clouds will be small and each and every one of them will have a silver lining.
sagittarius,You may be competitive by nature and you may want to do better than your rivals but common sense should tell you that is not always going to be possible. Don’t compare yourself to others today, compare yourself only to who you were yesterday. ,sagittarius,It’s not like you to be suspicious but the Sun in Cancer does seem to be having a negative effect on your expectations of other people. So long as you keep those suspicions to yourself everything will be okay. Be cautious, but be quiet too. ,sagittarius,You must not allow other people to drag you down to their level. Certain individuals may be annoying but there is no point getting angry in return because that means they have won. Just remove yourself from their presence for a while. ,sagittarius,If you want to get your financial house in order now is the time. According to the planets if you don’t make changes over the next few days it will become almost impossible to balance the books. First and foremost, cut back on non-essentials.
sagittarius,You can and you must make a good impression on employers and other important people this weekend. Don’t hide yourself away where you cannot be seen, get out into the world and seek out the spotlight. The powers that be will admire your daring.
sagittarius,You will receive good news concerning your finances this week. You certainly won’t have to pay as much for something you thought would cost an arm and a leg. Next time, don’t waste so much time and energy worrying about money.
sagittarius,Love what you are doing or do something else. That is the message of the stars for you as the new week begins, so focus only on what you are good at and what you enjoy. Success will arrive sooner rather than later. ,sagittarius,You have got it into your head that a friend is telling you lies and, who knows, you may be right. But chances are you are wrong and, if so, any unfounded allegations you make will rebound on you later. Check the facts before you open your mouth.
sagittarius,You go out of your way to help people in need but sometimes you get taken advantage of. Make sure those who come to you for assistance today are genuine and deserving cases, rather than just trying to make a quick buck at your expense. ,sagittarius,The planets make it difficult to think straight or make plans at the moment, so back off a little and let life come to you for a change. Let those around you make the big decisions over the next 24 hours – give your mind a break.
sagittarius,Because you have let your fears get the better of you in recent weeks it has become so much harder to make a sensible decision about a money matter or family issue. Strive to think clearly. Above all, keep your personal feelings out of the equation.
sagittarius,Saturn in your sign urges you to err on the side of caution, even if you are desperate to do something big and exciting. It won’t be long before the outlook improves and you can take risks again but for now you are advised to play safe.
sagittarius,There is so much more you could be doing but your fears keep holding you back. However, the planets indicate that if you are now prepared to face up to them they will no longer have any hold over you. It’s time to break free. ,sagittarius,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs finances and investments means you would be wise not to take chances with money, be it your own or other people’s. Don’t risk a large loss for what in all probability is just a small gain.
sagittarius,It is essential that you think before you speak today, because if others misunderstand your intentions it could lead to all sorts of problems. Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart urges you to use plain and simple language. ,sagittarius,You may have an obsession with perfection but it would be wrong of you to expect everyone else to share it. If you take it too far you might tempt others to be obstructive, maybe even destructive, simply because they don’t like to be pushed.
sagittarius,You need to get your financial house in order – you know that – but don’t neglect other areas. Both at home and at work there are people depending on you and what they need most is your time and attention – things that money can’t buy.
sagittarius,If you have an idea that you think someone in a position of power might like to be involved with by all means approach them. But make sure it is well thought out. They won’t be impressed if they can pick holes in it. Do your homework first.
sagittarius,The planets promise there is no longer any need to worry about a money matter that has been causing you sleepless nights. Over the next few days you will be amazed, and delighted, to find that the situation takes care of itself. Lucky you!,sagittarius,It may be frustrating that there are so many obstacles in your path but there is no point making a fuss. Just carry on as you are and believe that you will reach your goal when the time is right. That time may be closer than you think.
sagittarius,Minor disagreements could easily get out of hand over the next 24 hours, so think before you speak and, if others say things you do not agree with, let it go. Also, what you believe in today may not be what you believe in tomorrow.
sagittarius,The less you reveal about your comings and goings today the more others will be drawn to you. If you want to cultivate star quality – and you do, you do – then you need to keep a distance between you and your adoring public.
sagittarius,Yes, you can make your mark on the world and be rich and famous but satisfying your worldly desires is not enough. What happens today will remind you that there is more to existence than getting and consuming. You need to feed your spirit too. ,sagittarius,Mercury’s change of signs today will lead to a broadening of your horizons. Ideas that never meant much to you before will now capture your imagination as you see new connections and new possibilities. Let your mind lead you – it knows the way.
sagittarius,It may seem as if others are trying to make life difficult for you but, in reality, you can only make life difficult for yourself. What happens in the world outside your head is largely a result of what goes on inside your head, so be positive.
sagittarius,You always enjoy a bit of gossip but you will be shocked to find that the main topic of conversation this weekend is . . . you! Will you like what you hear? Probably not, but look on the bright side: at least you have been noticed.
sagittarius,If you want to be free of money worries you must earn more or spend less – preferably both. What occurs over the coming week will help you make ends meet but it won’t necessarily be easy and it will require some kind of sacrifice.
sagittarius,It is important that you know your limits today because if you bite off more than you can chew you may end up choking. Also, get out of the habit of thinking you should be perfect. You’re a lot more fun when you make mistakes!,sagittarius,A full moon in the main financial area of your chart means you probably won’t see eye-to-eye with people over business and money matters today. But that’s okay. Give it time and the situation will resolve itself to your benefit – and theirs.
sagittarius,You must be open and honest in your communications today. If you leave things vague no one will know what it is you are trying to communicate and, as a consequence, nothing much of importance will get done. Be blunt if you have to. ,sagittarius,If you find yourself stuck in the same old place, with the same old people, doing the same old things today then clearly you are doing something wrong. You need to break free and the best way to do that is to take a vacation. You deserve one. ,sagittarius,Anything is possible for you now – yes, anything. The Sun’s journey through your fellow Fire sign of Leo over the next few weeks means that confidence will not be in short supply – though common sense may be harder to come by. ,sagittarius,You will meet some interesting people over the next 48 hours but you need to be aware that at least some of them will look at the world in ways that are alien to you. Yes, of course, you can be friends, but you won’t ever be close.
sagittarius,There may be some risks involved in what you are planning to do but that won’t worry you in the slightest. On the contrary, it will add to the excitement and make success, when it comes, all the more enjoyable. Go for it!,sagittarius,The message of the stars this week is that you are not thinking straight and because of that the advice you give to other people could easily be wrong. If you are smart you will look out for your own needs. Others can take care of themselves.
sagittarius,Keep your ideas to yourself over the next 24 hours because if you let slip what you are going to do you may find that someone tries to disrupt your plans. Sometimes you can be too friendly for your own good. Don’t give too much away.
sagittarius,The time has come to make up your mind once and for all what it is you want most out of life and to focus all your energies in that direction. Forget about what might have been because it’s what still can be that matters. ,sagittarius,A friend will make you the kind of offer you find hard to believe today but if you don’t take it seriously you will kick yourself later when you realize, too late, that it was just right for you. Good things are coming your way. ,sagittarius,Why are so many people behaving so irrationally all of a sudden? Whatever the reason you don’t have to let yourself be infected by the virus of stupidity. Make sure all your thoughts are rational and all your decisions are logical and workable. ,sagittarius,Over the next few days you will feel a lot more confident about your beliefs. Don’t be afraid to express your opinions, however radical they might be, because you are now in a position to change things – if you are brave and if you speak up.
sagittarius,Over the next few days you will feel a lot more confident about your beliefs. Don’t be afraid to express your opinions, however radical they might be, because you are now in a position to change things – if you are brave and if you speak up.

sagittarius,Your confidence will be sky-high over the next 24 hours. You certainly won’t be afraid to take chances, either in your personal life or at work, and you won’t, for a single moment, think about the possibility of failure. You’re a winner Sag!,sagittarius,Now Mars is moving through your sign again your energy and your self-belief will come surging back and you will go all out to show the world what you are capable of. But know your limits too – no, not even Sags can do it all. ,sagittarius,It’s not like you to be plagued by self-doubt but for some reason you are. You need to snap yourself out of it quickly because there is important work to be done, the kind of work that only a fully self-confident Sag can make a success of. ,sagittarius,As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the career area of your chart today you must turn your attention to your professional status and find ways to make a good impression on powerful people. Stun them with your charm and charisma.
sagittarius,You are not the sort to avoid making difficult decisions and that’s good because you will have to make a few of them this weekend. Get tough with people who have let you down but don’t go overboard about it – the punishment must fit the crime.
sagittarius,You seem to be spending a lot of time doing things for other people that you do not truly believe in. At some stage over the next few days you are going to have to cut back on your commitments. Take back the time you have lost.
sagittarius,You will never convince those who do not want to be convinced, so don’t waste your time trying. If needs be just go it alone and show those who doubted your ideas and your ambition how wrong they were. Yes, you are allowed to gloat.
sagittarius,Important people are watching you closely and with the Sun moving in your favor they are sure to like what they see. They will like it even more if you show you are a team player and not someone who hogs the glory for yourself.
sagittarius,Today’s Mercury-Pluto link means your thoughts are more powerful than you realize. Now that you know that make sure that only pleasant and positive ideas are granted room in your brain. Nasty and negative ideas must be banished for good.
sagittarius,There will be a lot of confusion and deception over the next 24 hours and you will need to cut through the fog of misinformation to find out what is really going on. Quiet your mind and let your inner voice guide you.
sagittarius,You have been a bit too serious of late and need to get back to that happy-go-lucky attitude that you are rightly famous for. Also, if you do something on the spur of the moment it will turn out better than if you had planned it in detail. ,sagittarius,You have come through a lot in recent weeks but now you can see there was reason for everything that happened. The dark days are over, so put your doubts and fears behind you and act as if anything and everything is possible. It is!,sagittarius,What seems like such a good idea now may seem anything but later in the week, so curb your enthusiasm and keep an eye on fast-moving events. Thursday’s full moon will turn your world upside down, but in a good way. ,sagittarius,You need to take life at a less frenzied pace for a while. There may be a thousand and one tasks that need doing but you will do them better if you give yourself a break between now and Thursday’s full moon. Less of the partying too!,sagittarius,Demand the best and you will get the best. You only have to put a name to your dreams now to see them come true. All things are possible for those who dare and no one is as daring as those born under the sign of the Archer.
sagittarius,It would be tempting to write off someone’s criticism as sour grapes but there may be a very good reason why they think what you are doing is wrong. Make it your business to find out what it is – it could save you a lot of trouble. ,sagittarius,You have never been the most patient of people and if anyone thinks or moves too slowly for your liking today they will be left in no doubt that you are not impressed. Try to be a bit more tolerant – your anger won’t change them.
sagittarius,No matter how anxious you may be about a certain situation you must stay calm at all costs. Identify what the problem is and then come up with a plan to take care of it. Chances are you will find it’s not as bad as you thought it was.
sagittarius,Forget about the bad things that have happened recently and focus on the good things that are going to take place in your life in the months to come. This is not a time for hesitation, this is a time for action, especially where your career is concerned.
sagittarius,You will be called upon to lead by example over the next few weeks, both in your personal life and in your work. Show others that it is possible to do well and reach the top without resorting to underhand methods. Be noble in everything you do.
sagittarius,As the Sun crosses the career angle of your chart today this is the ideal time to start thinking about whether you are happy in your work and, if not, what you can do to improve things. Don’t be afraid to make a major change.
sagittarius,The Sun in Virgo at this time of year makes you intensely ambitious, as does the presence of Mars in your sign, so don’t let anyone tell you that certain things cannot be done. For you, all things are possible, today and every day.
sagittarius,Yes, you have a lot of work on your plate but there is no point complaining about it. Today’s Mars-Saturn link in your sign means you must knuckle down and finish what you started – most likely something that should have been finished weeks ago.
sagittarius,You seem eager to take offense at the moment but the planets warn this is not a good time to annoy those who have the power to disrupt your plans. Stay on good terms with people in positions of authority. You want them as friends, not enemies. ,sagittarius,If you make an effort to get along with people today you will accomplish a lot. If, however, you get impatient or angry you may turn others against you. Why make enemies when you could just as easily make friends who will always support you?,sagittarius,If you show willing this weekend you will not only get through a mountain of work but you will impress the powers that be. Every effort you make will be rewarded above and beyond what you would normally expect. Enjoy your good fortune.
sagittarius,No doubt you are determined to prove how smart and ambitious you can be, but don’t overdo it. The planets warn there are dangers ahead and if you throw caution to the wind it could end in tears by the end of the week. Be careful.
sagittarius,You will find yourself attracted to someone whose personality is the opposite of your own today. It could be the start of a beautiful friendship but don’t expect it to develop into something more than that or you could both be disappointed.
sagittarius,If something you are working on is not going right take it as a sign that you need to get help. There are plenty of people who can advise you but first you must get over the idea that asking for assistance is a sign of weakness. It’s not.
sagittarius,If you have something to say, no matter how controversial it might be, you will say it out loud and you won’t care in the slightest if others get annoyed. But don’t go looking to antagonize people in positions of power purely for the fun of it!,sagittarius,If you have not yet reached the place you want to be in your life don’t worry too much because it is just a matter of time. The planets indicate that you are closer to a breakthrough than you realize, so keep your eyes and ears open. ,sagittarius,The time has come to let employers and other important people know what you think of them. You don’t have to be nasty about it but you do have to be honest. If they are smart they will realize they deserve to be criticized.
sagittarius,No matter how ambitious you may be the simple fact is if you continue at your current tempo you are going to do yourself some damage. Be sensible this weekend and take life at a more sedate pace. Don’t run yourself into the ground.
sagittarius,Your head is full of big ideas at the moment. You know you have what it takes to make a name for yourself and you know that if you make a serious effort it won’t be long before your name is up in lights. Prepare to be a star. ,sagittarius,Don’t listen to those who say you are being too pushy and competitive because, if anything, you are not being pushy enough. What happens over the next few days will give you a golden opportunity to prove you have what it takes – so take it!,sagittarius,King-size efforts will yield king-size results today, so if you are ambitious and desire your own personal slice of fame and fortune, now is the time to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight. You possess star quality in abundance. ,sagittarius,Why are you comparing yourself to people who are on a higher rung of the ladder than you? The only thing you should compare is where you are today in relation to where you were yesterday. What other people do is of no importance. ,sagittarius,There will be kind words from people in positions of authority today. Even if you are the sort of Sag who doesn’t much care what others think of you it will be nice to get the kind of compliments that show your efforts are valued. ,sagittarius,Some people go out of their way to avoid doing things they have been taught are “wrong” but you are the kind of person who likes to experiment and test things for yourself. Don’t ever change that – in fact, do it more so than ever today. ,sagittarius,You may be of the opinion that you have fallen behind your rivals, and you may be right, but this is not the time to do anything rash in an effort to catch up. Slow down. Be patient. Most likely your situation is not as bad as it seems.
sagittarius,Mars in your sign makes you hugely assertive but because it is at odds with the Sun during the early party of the week you must be careful when dealing with rivals, especially at work. Don’t start fights or feuds for the fun of it.
sagittarius,Something will happen over the next few days that changes your status dramatically and that could be either good news or bad. If it’s the former, don’t let success go to your head. If it’s the latter, it’s not the end of the world.
sagittarius,If someone takes liberties with you over the next few days you must come down on them hard. If you let them off the hook it will not only look like weakness on your part but will encourage them, and others, to take more liberties in future.
sagittarius,You enjoy a challenge and that’s just as well because the approaching eclipse will confront you with events that demand a vigorous response. If you get the chance to impress people in positions of power you must take it – it could be the making of you. ,sagittarius,Today’s lunar eclipse cuts across two of the most important angles of your chart, so be ready for some major upheavals, both at home and at work. If you are flexible and bend with the breeze you will live to fight another day. ,sagittarius,You can persuade almost anyone to do almost anything for you now. Does that get your mind racing with interesting ideas? Just make sure they are ideas you can feel comfortable with when you look back on your actions a few weeks from now.
sagittarius,Why are you running away from something that scares you? You should know by now that the things we fear the most often turn out to be the things that matter the least. Face up to what scares you and defeat it once and for all. ,sagittarius,You may be confident that you can make your plans work but you are advised not to move ahead with them just yet. Over the next few days a number of things will occur that could lead to a major rethink. There is no need to rush things.
sagittarius,Before you blame other people for what has gone wrong in your life take a long, hard look in the mirror and be honest about your own contribution. You are in control Sagittarius – always have been and always will be – so get a grip! ,sagittarius,No matter how worrying your current situation might appear, in a few weeks time you will look back and realize it was really not so bad. Be positive in everything you think, say and do and before you know it you will be flying again. ,sagittarius,Mars in your sign makes all things seem possible and with the Sun on your side as well there is precious little you cannot accomplish. Courage and confidence you have in abundance but don’t forget you will need plenty of common sense too. ,sagittarius,Matters of a material nature must not be taken too seriously this week. What you earn and own may seem important but in the greater scheme of things they simply don’t register. It’s your spiritual account, not your bank account, that matters.
sagittarius,Wherever you go and whatever you do today you will meet people who want to do favors for you. You are very much flavor of the month at the moment, which is nice, but nice doesn’t pay the bills. How can you profit from your popularity?,sagittarius,You have built up quite a head of steam in recent weeks and if you are smart you will find ways to keep it going. The only area where you might have to watch out is where cash is concerned. You can’t afford to buy everything!,sagittarius,Everything has its allotted span, it’s natural lifecycle, so don’t try to hang on to something that is on its way out, because not only do you no longer need it but by grasping it so tightly you stop something more beneficial from coming in.
sagittarius,You may be having second thoughts about a plan or project that is sure to upset those of a nervous disposition. But the planets warn you will berate yourself later if you hold back only to discover it was the right thing to do. Go for it! ,sagittarius,By all means plan something new and exciting today but don’t start on it just yet. According to the planets there may be something you have overlooked, something that could cause problems later on. Tomorrow’s new moon should reveal what it is.
sagittarius,What happens this weekend will remind you that material success is not the be all and end all of life. The answers you seek are not to be found in the size of your pay packet or even in popularity. They are to be found in your heart.
sagittarius,You are not the kind of person who is troubled by self-doubt, so even if a few things go wrong this week it won’t throw you off your stride. When the going gets tough that’s when Sag gets going – if nothing else you love a challenge.
sagittarius,You are good at giving advice but not so good at taking it. A friend or family member will say something today that does not fit with what you want to believe but they know what they are talking about, so be smart and listen.
sagittarius,With the Sun linked to Saturn in your birth sign you will find it quite easy to work out who your real friends and your real enemies are. Once you have that information, sit on it for a while. Use it only when the time is right.
sagittarius,There is nothing wrong with power itself but the planets warn if you use your position merely to gratify your own desires you may regret it. Bear that thought in mind today before you take something you are not entitled to take. ,sagittarius,You need to have a serious talk with someone who has an unhappy knack of rubbing you up the wrong way. Explain to them as simply as you can that you would like to be friends but are finding it difficult because of their selfish behavior. ,sagittarius,The planets warn that anything you do on impulse today is likely to backfire – and most likely it will be you who gets burned. Accept things as they are a little bit longer because in a matter of days a new opportunity will be coming your way. ,sagittarius,You may not think of yourself as an intuitive person but you can see with your mind’s eye what needs to be done. Logic, common sense and self-belief can take you only so far. Let the inner you, the real you, guide you this weekend.
sagittarius,Tuesday’s link between mind planet Mercury and your ruler Jupiter will bring all sorts of new and interesting possibilities your way. Don’t reject what you see and hear just because it is alien to you. It could be a lot of fun too. ,sagittarius,You must deal with an outstanding feud at once, because if you allow it to drag on it will hold you back for weeks, maybe even months. You don’t have to admit defeat but you do have to look a bit harder for a compromise solution.
sagittarius,There are a lot of strange ideas in the air at the moment, so be careful what you allow yourself to believe. Also, you need to get past the notion that there are plots and conspiracies taking place all around you. It’s your imagination going to extremes. ,sagittarius,Yes, someone you are close to emotionally has betrayed your trust but try not to let your disappointment show. This is one of those situations where, if you get annoyed, you could make the situation a lot worse than it would otherwise be. ,sagittarius,You are moving so fast at the moment that you are not sure you could slow down if you wanted to. You must, however, take time out today to pay certain bills that are well past their due dates. You cannot just ignore financial reality. ,sagittarius,If you let slip private information today you could find it being used against you later on by your rivals. Sometimes you can be too open and honest for your own good, so keep your secrets to yourself – the world does not need to know about them. ,sagittarius,There are so many interesting things going on in your neighborhood at the moment, so why do you wish you were some place else? Why not stay where you are and put your heart and soul into what’s going on in the community? You’ll love it.
sagittarius,Relationships in general and affairs of the heart in particular must be handled with care over the next 24 hours. Don’t give someone the impression that they mean the world to you when, in reality, you can take or leave their friendship.
sagittarius,Yes, certain people are gossiping about you but there is nothing you can do about it, and no logical reason why you should be concerned. Let’s face it, you are the kind of person who attracts all sorts of stories – a few of them may even be true!,sagittarius,You are one of those people who seem to believe that the best way to deal with a problem is to hit it hard and often. That may have worked for you in the past but it won’t work now. A more subtle approach is called for today.
sagittarius,You need to admit that you don’t know it all and could do with some help. It may take some effort to swallow your pride but once you have done so you will discover that it can actually be fun working as part of a team.
sagittarius,Resist the urge to splash the cash. While Mars is moving through the money area of your chart there is a danger you will go over the top and spend a lot more than you can afford. Find less costly ways to cheer yourself up.
sagittarius,The Sun’s move into the most sensitive area of your chart this weekend will encourage you to show your softer side – yes, it’s true, you do have one! Don’t be afraid to admit, if only to yourself, that you sometimes need a shoulder to cry on. ,sagittarius,You need to clear out all that emotional junk you have been carrying around with you. If anyone tries to make you feel guilty for what you have done just ignore them. Shut the door on the past and move on without a backward glance.
sagittarius,What occurs today may, on the surface, look like yet another setback but later in the week you will realize it was a blessing in disguise. Between now and then, give some thought to how you can streamline and simplify your daily affairs.
sagittarius,Make sure you read the small print today. It may be the case that someone is trying to cheat you, or it may be that a genuine mistake has been made but either way you must not take it on trust that you will get a fair deal.
sagittarius,Jupiter’s expansive influence means you will throw caution to the wind today. Success is guaranteed IF you are willing to take advice from friends and family and others who care about you. Listen to what they say and act on what you learn. ,sagittarius,Being the adventurous sort you often find yourself in locations and situations without knowing how you managed to get there. Don’t worry if you feel a bit lost over the next 24 hours – you’ll find your way home sooner or later. ,sagittarius,Open up a bit and show your vulnerable side – yes, you do have one! Even a happy-go-lucky Sag needs a shoulder to cry on once in a while and there are plenty of people you can confide in. Remember: a problem shared is a problem halved. ,sagittarius,The planets urge you to be more adventurous when it comes to your financial affairs, but not so adventurous that you lose touch with reality. What worked for you in the past may not work as well for you now, so try something new.
sagittarius,You need to get serious about something that you have not always taken seriously in the past. The pressure you feel to sort it out is pressure that comes from within, from the deepest part of you, there can be no more excuses – get on with it.
sagittarius,Some people will be critical of the way you live today, but only because they are jealous of your freewheeling ways. The more they say you should be like them the more determined you will be to go your own way. Good for you.
sagittarius,You may not be the sort who cares much what others think about you but you will go out of your way to make a good impression today. You will enjoy showing certain individuals that they are not as good at reading people as they like to believe.
sagittarius,A little bit of teamwork now will reap big rewards later on, so make sure partners and colleagues know you are in it together. Principles may be more important than profit but that does not mean you can ignore the financial aspects of the situation.
sagittarius,It may seem as if your hopes have been dashed but that is not the case. Yes, what happened recently was a rather large setback but if you give it time you will eventually get what it is you desire. Can you spell ‘patience’ Sag? ,sagittarius,What happens today and over the weekend will convince you that it is time to give up on something that isn’t going to work. At least it will have taught you a valuable lesson: that not even a Sagittarius can go it alone every time. ,sagittarius,You will come up with some amazing ideas over the next 48 hours. You will also be on inspired form in your personal life. If you begin a relationship this weekend it is sure to be exciting. Existing relationships will also be a lot more fun.
sagittarius,You need to learn an important lesson, namely that if you want to get on in life it pays to network with people who are well connected. You may not be much of a team player but, for the coming week at least, try pretending you are.
sagittarius,There has been a lot of coming and going of late and to make sense of it you will need to stand back and see your activities in a wider context. What do they mean? Where are they taking you? More to the point, are they all necessary?,sagittarius,If you need help today then you must ask for it. Friends and family will happily come to your aid but they cannot read your mind, so speak up and let them know what kind of assistance it is you require. You cannot possibly do it all yourself.
sagittarius,You can sense that a new cycle is about to begin and as it begins you must make an effort to shake off the negative thinking that has been plaguing you of late. The world is still a wonderful place – and you are still a wonderful person. ,sagittarius,Anyone who tries to stop you from doing what you want to be doing today is going to wish they had stayed out of your way. Your hyper independent nature won’t allow you to take orders from other people, not even the people you love.
sagittarius,One moment you feel confident and courageous, the next you want to run away and hide from the world. That’s not like you at all Sagittarius, so get your head together and find out what is upsetting your emotional equilibrium – then deal with it. ,sagittarius,You need to take a more relaxed attitude to your cashflow situation and to the material side of life generally. Deep down you know that whatever your problems may be you will find a way to deal with them. It’s only money after all.
sagittarius,Why are you making life so difficult for yourself? If it is because you hope others will show sympathy you may have to wait a very long time. Loved ones have issues of their own to deal with – yours are way down the list in importance.
sagittarius,Something will happen today that catches you by surprise and while you won’t be the only one who feels like a fool you are more likely than most to react in a negative way. Don’t take life so seriously Sag. Be your normal upbeat self.
sagittarius,There have been times of late when two quite different sides of your nature were at war with each other. It may have been an uncomfortable experience but it won’t last much longer – your split personality is already beginning to heal.
sagittarius,You seem to have got it into your head that someone is out to get you and that if you make a wrong move they will come down on you hard. What happens today will surely convince you that it’s all in your mind. Be positive Sag! ,sagittarius,Before the Sun moves into your sign on Monday there are a number of issues that must be dealt with. They may be a chore but the more little things you take care of now the less likely they are to trip you up later on.
sagittarius,A smile from a stranger or a kind word from a friend will cheer you up no end today. Then you will be more inclined to be nice to the people you meet over the weekend. It’s small ripples like these that make the world a better place.
sagittarius,It is possible to be too nice for your own good and with Neptune strong in your chart at the moment there is a danger you will let people off the hook when they do not deserve to be treated so leniently. Watch out you don’t regret it later.
sagittarius,After all the setbacks and disappointments of recent weeks the Sun’s move into your birth sign tomorrow will make it seem as if all things are possible, and indeed they are. Make your next move the best one you’ve got, then repeat it each and every day.
sagittarius,With the Sun moving into your sign today you are no doubt eager to get started on all those great things you’ve been planning. But you have plenty of time to make your mark, so start at an easy pace and build up speed as the week goes on.
sagittarius,You are in such a positive frame of mind now that all things are possible. The only danger is that you will do something that’s bad for you simply because someone has dared you to do it. The one thing you don’t have to do is prove yourself.
sagittarius,You may think you can do no wrong at the moment and you are most likely right but don’t go too far. Saturn in your sign warns that a rival is looking for ways to bring you down a notch or two. Don’t make it easy for them. ,sagittarius,Remind yourself again that this is your time of year and that all things are possible. With the Sun, Saturn and Mercury moving through your sign there is nothing you cannot get out of life, but you must first put a name to your dream.
sagittarius,You have been exceptionally dynamic of late and will reach new heights of success over the next 24 hours. You can sense that if you want to make changes now is the time, so be bold and be the one everyone else wants to be like.
sagittarius,You are well aware of what you can do and now you must make sure the rest of the world is aware of it too. There is no need to be modest, or embarrassed that you are so far ahead of the pack – everyone needs to know you’re the best. ,sagittarius,What would you do if you knew you could not fail? So do it! Not only does the Sun in your sign favor creative and career activities but the upcoming new moon will encourage you to be more daring and dynamic – yes, even more so than now.
sagittarius,A little bit of optimism will go a long way over the next few days, so get your head right and get ready to have some fun. You have so much going for you and so much to look forward to – there is simply no excuse not to smile.
sagittarius,You may be eager to start something new but don’t be in such a mad rush that you overlook important details. Use today’s new moon in your sign to clarify what your ambitions are going to be – then work towards them one at a time.
sagittarius,You no doubt feel pumped up and ready for anything but you are strongly advised not to just throw yourself at each and every challenge that comes your way. Be selective in what you do or a lot of what you do will be wasted. ,sagittarius,What you need to remember today is that causes always have consequences. If you fall into the trap of thinking that you can do what you like the next few days could be uncomfortable to say the least. Think before you speak before you act.
sagittarius,Wherever you go today and over the weekend you will find that people are unusually friendly. Whether you are travelling long distance or merely going down to the corner store to buy groceries everyone will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. ,sagittarius,You will find that people relate to you better this weekend if you give them more freedom. Let them off the leash for a bit. Let them make their own decisions for a change. You don’t have to check up on them every minute of every day. ,sagittarius,Chances are you will make important decisions based purely on instinct over the next few days. The good news is those decisions will be right. The even better news is that you will so enjoy acting on impulse that you start doing it more often. ,sagittarius,Don’t waste time trying to explain to friends and family members what you are trying to do because they won’t understand. The only thing that matters now is that you have the confidence to act, even if you have no choice but to act alone.
sagittarius,The best way to impress people, at home and at work, is to be straight with them, so stick to the facts. What you have to say may not be what they want to hear but it’s the truth that matters, not keeping their fragile egos happy.
sagittarius,Don’t run away from a problem just because you are not sure how to handle it. The planets indicate that if you put on a brave face and deal with as best you can you may be surprised how easily a solution can be found. There’s no need to panic.
sagittarius,You won’t take kindly to being told where you are going wrong today, but the planets warn you have only a limited grasp of what is going on and what others tell you will be needed to complete the picture. Don’t let your ego get in the way.
sagittarius,Friendships and group activities will be a lot of fun over the next 24 hours, so even if you have serious chores to complete you are advised to put them off to a later date. You don’t have to be the serious one all the time you know.
sagittarius,With Saturn, planet of restriction, overshadowing the Sun in your sign this weekend you may find that your options are limited. But that could actually be a good thing because it will force you to focus on the one thing that truly matters.
sagittarius,You may be tempted to rush things this week but if you do you will have to go back and correct your mistakes when the moon is full on the 14th. Don’t worry, you have not fallen that far behind in your schedule and can catch up later on.
sagittarius,The Sun in your sign links nicely with Uranus, planet of the unexpected, today, so something out of the ordinary is likely to happen. It will also be something you enjoy, so don’t hide yourself away, seek out situations that excite you.
capricorn,However much you may wish to avoid any kind of unpleasantness you should not do so at the expense of your own self-esteem. If you show signs of weakness the only thing you can be sure of is that someone will take advantage.
capricorn,Generally you take people as you find them and don’t care where they are coming from or where they are going to. Today though you should check all credentials before getting involved in anything of a financial nature.
capricorn,There is no point trying to hide your feelings because others can see how you are hurting. What they don’t understand though is why you are hurting. If you need help – and you do – then you really must be honest with them. ,capricorn,Act rationally in everything you do today, even if it gets you a reputation as someone who is all head and no heart. Experience has taught you that people who follow only their emotions usually end up with nothing worth having.
capricorn,It may seem as if you are being held back by circumstances beyond your control but is that true? According to the planets it’s just as likely you are putting mental obstacles in your path that have no reason being there. Sort your mind out. ,capricorn,Close your ears to criticism and don’t waste time trying to get even with those who have let you down or said hurtful things – they’re not worth the effort. Time is too precious to waste on petty people and personal vendettas.
capricorn,Mars, planet of action and energy, crosses the career angle of your chart this weekend, so you will be even more go-getting than usual. Before beginning something new though try finishing a project that you only recently started.
capricorn,You seem determined to see the worst in every situation – and you need to get over it quickly. Your happiness depends entirely on the way you choose to look at events – and the good news is that is wholly under your control. ,capricorn,Someone you work or do business with has been taking liberties of late and you are almost at the point where you have to say something rude. Think carefully before you open your mouth though. Do you really want to start a war?,capricorn,Make sure you deal only with people who are exciting and original today. Some of their ideas may be a little way out for your more traditional tastes but no matter: they will spur you on to try a few creative tricks of your own.
capricorn,You may not have made as much progress on the work front as your talents deserve but with Mars moving through the career area of your chart it won’t be long before the picture changes. You’ve got to be more assertive.
capricorn,You would dearly like to help someone who is struggling but you know if you do they will struggle even more in the future. This is one of those situations where they need to learn from their own mistakes, painful though that may be for you both.
capricorn,There is a danger that your frustration will get the better of you and you will say or do something that gets you noticed for the wrong sort of reason. But at least others will be aware that you’re not afraid to hit back at provocation.
capricorn,You have always been ambitious but over the next two or three days you will amaze even yourself by your desire to move up in the world. Whatever restrictions you feel life has imposed on you just throw them off and be brilliant.
capricorn,Stand back and let other people take center stage this weekend, especially on the work front where the further away you are from a project the less likely it is you will get part of the blame when, inevitably, it all goes wrong.
capricorn,You don’t lack for ideas at the moment but you seem strangely reluctant to let the world know about them. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing. You don’t want rivals stealing your insights before you get the chance to exploit them yourself.
capricorn,Don’t waste your time arguing about something that is trivial in the extreme. If you find yourself losing your temper with someone who refuses to see sense just turn your back and walk away. That will hurt them much more.
capricorn,When the Sun moves into your sign this weekend a new solar year begins. Make it your objective, today and tomorrow, to look back over the past 12 months and learn what you can from your mistakes. After that it’s full speed ahead. ,capricorn,It would appear that in your haste to get ahead you have overlooked some small but important detail and if you don’t recognize that fact soon it will come back to slap you in the face. Identify your mistake, put it right and move on.
capricorn,The Sun moves into your sign today, so put the past behind you and start with a clean slate. What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so be positive in word and deed and aim to be the very best you can be right here and now.
capricorn,You must define your goals clearly. You must also keep them within realistic bounds. If you can do those two simple things then what you achieve over the next 12 months will overshadow what you achieved in the previous 12 years. It’s your time to shine.
capricorn,No matter how many rivals oppose you and no matter how much they threaten to disrupt your plans you must hold your nerve. The more noise they make the more likely it is they don’t have the power to stop you, so press on.
capricorn,Decide what is the most important thing you should be doing right now and do it to the exclusion of everything else. The Sun and Mercury in your sign makes it easy for you to focus on essentials. Your efforts will not be wasted.
capricorn,Cosmic activity that cuts across the domestic and career angles of your chart urges you to get the family-work balance right. It also suggests you need to delegate more. You don’t have to do every last thing yourself you know.
capricorn,As cosmic activity in your sign reaches a peak over the new year period you will have to deal with situations that in the past you have tried to avoid. The good news is solutions can easily be found, but you’ve got to act now.
capricorn,This is a time to relax and have fun with family and friends. The planets suggest you can do as you please and get away with it today, so do nothing or do everything – the only cosmic demand is that you do it with a smile.
capricorn,This is potentially a wonderful weekend for you, so make the most of it and make sure you get your way whatever it is you are planning to do. With so much great cosmic activity in and around your sign you really can’t lose.
capricorn,You will have tons of ideas over the next 12 months and some of them will be touched by genius. However, your birthday chart warns that others are so far out in the universe they have no hope of coming true. Try to keep your imaginings within reasonable bounds,capricorn,You don’t lack courage or confidence, so why are you not using them to the full? Maybe it’s because you can sense that Wednesday’s new moon will bring a brilliant new opportunity your way. Is that what you are saving yourself for?,capricorn,You’ve been hugely ambitious of late and with mind planet Mercury joining forces with Pluto in your sign today you will be even more determined to make your mark. If you know what you want, no power on Earth can stop you from getting it. ,capricorn,Not only is there a new moon in your sign today but Pluto, planet of power, is on your side as well, so you won’t have any trouble getting your way. Both at home and at work people will go out of their way to do things for you.
capricorn,You don’t need to make drastic changes over the coming 12 months but you do need to be sure in your own mind what it is you are hoping to accomplish. Write down in a notebook your top five aims for the year ahead and carry it with you every single day.
capricorn,Try not to live in the past or lament your mistakes, because what happens next will more than make up for what you appear to have lost. Resolve to always look forward and never look back. It’s not nearly as hard as it sounds.
capricorn,Don’t be surprised if you get a bit emotional over the next 48 hours. With the Sun in your sign opposing Jupiter in Cancer, you have bottled up your feelings for too long — and now they’re going to explode. These things happen.
capricorn,Whatever it is that separates the winners from the losers you’ve got plenty, but are you using it to best effect? Your birthday chart urges you to get serious about changing your life for the better – and you might just change the world as well,capricorn,It is important that you tell the truth today, even if by doing so you cause yourself, and maybe others, a certain amount of grief. With communications planet Mercury linked to your ruler Saturn this is clearly the time for straight talk.
capricorn,Make the coming 12 months a time of consolidation. Make sure everything you have achieved over the past two years is safe and cannot be dismantled. Above all, enjoy all the good things that make life so special. No one deserves them more than you. ,capricorn,You must not allow anyone, not even your nearest and dearest, to hold you back from doing what you know is right for you personally. You have reached some kind of crossroads and now a decision has to be made. Inevitably, some people won’t like it.
capricorn,If you have fallen out with someone lately now is the time to kiss and make up. That applies to all kinds of relationships but mainly to those of a personal nature. It might not be such a good idea kissing your boss, after all!,capricorn,Start something new, something exciting, something adventurous, something that helps you make your mark on the world. Don’t worry that certain people might not approve – it’s a sure sign that you are doing something worthwhile.
capricorn,You have a great many plans for the coming 12 months and it is important that you let friends and loved ones know what you will be up to. If you go off at a tangent without warning they may think they no longer have a special relationship with you. Reassure them.
capricorn,You have accomplished so much in recent months that you may be afraid to take any more risks in case you lose what you have gained. Don’t worry, you won’t. The cosmic omens are all in your favor, so set your sights even higher this year.
capricorn,It’s good that you know your own mind but you also need to make sure those you live and work with know it as well. Spell out what it is you expect of them now and you will get it before the Sun leaves your sign on the 20th.
capricorn,Keep things simple and don’t let your emotions get the better of you over the next couple of days. Others can rush about like it’s the end of the world if they want but you will remain cool and calm and with full self-control.
capricorn,You will get the chance to put various relationships on a firmer footing over the coming year and you must take full advantage of it. Whatever your current differences may be they can and must be resolved. It’s better to work together than to worry alone.
capricorn,Your instincts rarely let you down but the planets warn you could easily be fooled by someone who knows how to play on your insecurities. Don’t fall for their lies and do something silly – if you do you will have only yourself to blame.
capricorn,You have been far too secretive in recent months and need to be more open about who you are and what you expect from life in the year ahead. Family and friends are there for you, so let them know what you need and don’t be surprised when you get it.
capricorn,Stay on good terms with employers and other people in prominent positions, because what you achieve – and how much you earn – over the next 12 months is not entirely in your own hands. In never hurts to have too many friends, especially powerful ones.
capricorn,The Sun is moving into the area of your chart that governs material things such as money and possessions – which means it is time to consolidate the gains you have made since the start of the year. Fortunately, you are not the sort to give anything away.
capricorn,If you need financial assistance now is the time to ask for it. The planets make it easy to convince those who can help that your cause is deserving. Having said which, their assistance will not come cheap, so help yourself as much as you can.
capricorn,You are trying hard to deny your feelings for someone because you fear it might damage your reputation and maybe even harm you financially. Who knows, maybe it will, but is that really a good enough excuse to turn your back on affection?,capricorn,Don’t worry if you have not yet begun work on a scheme that means a lot to you. In fact the longer you leave it the more likely it is to be a success. Good ideas need time to develop. You’ll know when the time is right to act.
capricorn,You may be desperate to be doing something more exciting with your life but don’t get so desperate that you act without thinking. If you do, and make a mistake, it will most likely hit you where it hurts most – in your wallet!,capricorn,Something you thought you understood perfectly now baffles you but there is no reason to be disheartened because the knowledge you appear to have lost will come back to you in a flash of inspiration this weekend. Keep thinking.
capricorn,Uranus, planet of genius, will help you find clever solutions to difficult problems, but you must be adaptable. If you are one of those stubborn Capricorns who expects others to change while you stay the same your problems will stay as they are.
capricorn,Try to be less suspicious when dealing with people on a professional level. That kind of attitude is self-fulfilling. If you think everyone is a shark then that is the kind of person you are going to attract. Come to think of it, how do others see you?,capricorn,It may seem as if you are at the mercy of events and all you can do is go with the flow but is that the right sort of attitude? You’re a Capricorn. You’re supposed to make things happen. Show you have not lost your leadership potential.
capricorn,Help partners and loved ones feel as good about themselves as you feel about yourself. That may be no easy task, but it can be done, and it must be done because happiness at home is essential to so many other things.
capricorn,Chances are Lady Luck will smile on you today – good things will come your way without you having to do very much to attract them. Having said which, don’t give away any personal information and don’t try too hard. Just let it happen.
capricorn,You will find it easy enough to get your way over the next 24 hours, especially if you tell others what they want to hear and leave any bad news you might have to another day. Is that dishonest? Maybe, but it’s not the worst thing you’ll ever do.
capricorn,Too often in the past you have allowed other people to call the shots but now you must do what you want to do, regardless of what the consequences might be. Most likely their will be no comeback at all. Your rivals’ threats are hollow.
capricorn,The most important thing this week is that you know your own mind and don’t let others tell you what you ought to believe. No matter how loud the so-called “experts” may be you must trust what your inner voice tells you – always.
capricorn,Someone whose point of view is very different to your own will say something that you cannot let pass and most likely you will end up having a major argument. But that’s okay. It’s wrong to remain silent. Call it as you see it.
capricorn,You will learn something to your advantage today, but you must keep the information to yourself. The urge to tell others may be strong but if you do they may try to benefit as well — and there is only so much cash to go around! ,capricorn,Be careful when dealing with people whose outlook on life is very different to your own. If you adopt the attitude that you are always right and they are always wrong then conflict is inevitable. Maybe you’re both right – or both wrong!,capricorn,If you want something enough you will find a way to get it but it may cost you a great deal of time and energy. What you have to decide is whether the sacrifice is worth it. Think long-term and give up something today for something better tomorrow.
capricorn,You may have something urgent to say, but now that Mercury (planet of communication) is moving retrograde, you will find it difficult to find the right words. Don’t worry: As important as your message is, it won’t hurt to wait.
capricorn,You will find it easier to be assertive on the work front over the next seven days but don’t go too far and give others the impression that you are turning into a dictator. In the long-term persuasion always works better than coercion.
capricorn,You may be tempted to do a task the hard way today, simply because you want to impress people in positions of power, but it isn’t necessary. What matters is that you can get the job done, not how you choose to do it. ,capricorn,Something you see or hear on your travels could be just what you’ve been waiting for. Even if it isn’t it will still be a lot of fun and fun is something that has been lacking of late. Don’t doubt yourself in any way. Just be who you are.
capricorn,You may want to be open and sociable but with communications planet Mercury now turning retrograde you would be wise not to give too much away. Anyone who starts asking personal questions is most likely not to be trusted.
capricorn,It seems you would rather go on making mistake after mistake rather than admit you are on the wrong track. Your fixity of purpose is often a great strength but not when you so obviously need to change direction. It’s time to get real.
capricorn,It may seem as if you have been left out of the loop, that everyone is more clued up than you, but it isn’t true, and even if it was it wouldn’t make any difference. You don’t need to be “in the know”, you just need to be you.
capricorn,The Sun leaves the financial area of your chart tomorrow but you still need to take care of your money and possessions. If you let down your guard, even for a moment, someone will try to part you from your hard-earned cash.
capricorn,Get out and about. Visit places that excite you and visit people who inspire you. Social activities of all kinds are under excellent stars, as is travel, so hit the road and don’t look back. Keep moving and the fun will keep on coming.
capricorn,If you make a promise today, you will have to keep that promise come what may, so think carefully before making any kind of commitment. With Mercury, planet of communication, under lots of pressure maybe you should keep your mouth shut. ,capricorn,Let people know what is on your mind today. Let them know what you are thinking and why it is important. If you keep your thoughts to yourself you will not only feel isolated but you will miss out on a chance to influence the great debate.
capricorn,Don’t waste your time or your energy on someone who seems determined to get under your skin. You can be a bit obsessive at times and if you let this little feud go on it could develop into something quite dangerous. Just walk away.
capricorn,Your confidence may be at a low right now but you will perk up considerably when you see what the weekend has to offer. Don’t turn down a social invitation because you are not in the mood. It could be more fun than you can handle!,capricorn,The planets are urging you to go out and have a good time. Do you need to be told twice? This is an excellent time for meeting people and swapping ideas about, well, just about everything. The more you chat the more your awareness will grow.
capricorn,Even if you are the kind of Capricorn who too often lets your inhibitions get in the way of having fun you will enjoy yourself immensely over the next few days. Why not look up a friend you have not seen or talked to in a while?,capricorn,You will get a lot out of social activities today, so make the effort to get out into the world. The more you allow yourself to engage with people, both friends and strangers, the more you will realize just how similar we all are.
capricorn,You don’t mind taking chances but with Jupiter in your opposite sign at odds with Uranus, planet of the unexpected today, it might be better to play safe. There is no such thing as a sure thing and you are smart enough to know that.
capricorn,For the past two or three weeks you have found it hard to get your thoughts together, which means progress has been slow, but now your mind will click into gear and you will soon be sailing along. Don’t plan ahead, just act.
capricorn,Don’t reject what you hear just because it sounds outrageous. What seems amazing to you may be an everyday occurrence to other people, so let your mind be open to all possibilities. It doesn’t, of course, mean you have to agree with them.
capricorn,Don’t hide your thoughts or disguise your feelings: let others know what is on your mind and in your heart. The planets urge you to speak up and make yourself heard. Will others like what you have to tell them? Of course they will!,capricorn,You will get the chance to mend a fractured relationship when Jupiter moves in your favor again in midweek. No matter what may have gone on between you and no matter how many bad words may have been said you CAN still make it work.
capricorn,Try not to let your suspicious nature get the better of you over the next few days because there is precious little you have to worry about. Pluto in your sign means others should be more afraid of you than you of them.
capricorn,There is every chance that you will lose your temper with a work colleague over the next 24 hours. But don’t get so angry that you risk bursting a blood vessel. Why put your health at risk over someone else’s stupidity?,capricorn,This should be a highly productive day but there is a danger that in your haste to show what you can do you will take on too many tasks and spread yourself too thin. Focus on the one thing you are really good at – and do it brilliantly.
capricorn,You’ve got this nagging feeling that you could have done more to make a success of a relationship. Maybe you’re right, maybe you could, but that was then and this is now, so stop looking back and look to the future instead.
capricorn,No matter how well you have planned things there are sure to be hold-ups and disruptions today and over the weekend, so promise yourself that you won’t get angry with people who move and think slowly. Stay calm. You’ll get there.
capricorn,You need to get used to the idea that not everyone sees things the same way as you. Maybe it would help if, over the weekend, you make a point of talking with people whose opinions you don’t understand. Get to know them better.
capricorn,You may not understand why certain things had to happen but your sixth sense tells you that was how it was meant to be. With that thought in mind, let others argue about the state of the world. All you have to do is find ways to enjoy it.
capricorn,Stay calm and don’t allow yourself to get carried away with your own success. The current cosmic picture makes most things possible for you but that does not mean you should try to do everything, at least not all at the same time.
capricorn,Many of the restrictions you have been laboring under in recent weeks will seem to get worse over the next few days. A crisis point will be reached around the time of the full moon on the 16th – after which they will all fade quickly away.
capricorn,Keep your options open over the next 24 hours, especially in your dealings with work colleagues and business partners. Because their plans are likely to change suddenly you may have to change too, but if you’re flexible you will still be in the money.
capricorn,You may not understand how and why certain events had to happen but you can see there is no point being negative about it. While others are complaining today you will be making the most of the changes taking place around you.
capricorn,If someone tries to pressure you into doing something you don’t really approve of today then you must turn them down flat. Yes, you may owe them for favors they have done you in the past but conscience comes first, even before friendship.
capricorn,Do you continue with a project that is taking up so much time and energy, or do you end it and move on to something else? Don’t make any final decisions this weekend. You may be too close to the situation to make a rational choice.
capricorn,Don’t take what you hear over the next few days too seriously because a lot of it will be no more than gossip. It could also be the case that someone who has an axe to grind may be trying to turn you against a friend.
capricorn,A social event will be a lot of fun and could lead to a new career opportunity. Knowledge and experience are always important but if it comes down to a tie-break between you and a rival it’s who you know that will count.
capricorn,At some point today you will discover that your money situation is not as bad as you thought it was and that will cheer you up immensely. But it is not an excuse to go on a spree – that’s how you got so worried in the first place.
capricorn,The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you can at last get to grips with a family issue that has been causing you plenty of grief. Let loved ones know what you think and how you feel and invite them to be honest with you as well.
capricorn,You don’t need to explain why you are doing certain things, not even to the people you love. Others will respect you more if you are confident about following your dreams and desires. Don’t complain. Don’t explain. Don’t apologize. Just act.
capricorn,Say what you believe to be true and don’t worry too much about the effect it may have on other people. Facts are facts and must not be denied, not even to spare the feelings of those who are not as smart or as stable as you.
capricorn,You may think you don’t need to change, that everything in your life is fine as it is, but is that really true? What happens this weekend will show you that change does not have to be something you need to avoid. It can even be fun.
capricorn,The more others tell you that something cannot be done the more determined you will be to do it. But you must stay within the bounds of what is ethical and legal. If you cut corners your enemies will seize on it to damage your reputation.
capricorn,Creatively and romantically the sky is the limit this week and with travel plans so well starred at the moment you really should be on the move. Don’t let family duties hold you back. You are entitled to some time for yourself.
capricorn,Mars, planet of action and ambition, is moving through the career area of your chart, so chances are you will be even more go-getting than usual. You may face opposition to your plans but you have never been one to avoid a fight.
capricorn,It’s not like you to be so easygoing about people you don’t much like and opinions you think are stupid but you seem to have reached a point where, frankly, you no longer care. Getting uptight about things is not worth the hassle.
capricorn,No matter how busy you may be work wise at the moment you must make an effort to free up some time to spend with your friends and your family. They are the people who really matter. For the moment at least your career comes second.
capricorn,Pluto in your sign endows you with the courage that is needed to get things done and today and over the weekend you will push yourself harder than you have done for a long time. But it’s not just about physical effort – think harder, and deeper, too.
capricorn,No matter how many upsets and upheavals there have been on the home front of late you can and you will resolve them all. This weekend’s new moon will not only enable you to call a truce but will also help you build bridges that last.
capricorn,Be honest about how you feel over the next few days, because if you give others the impression that everything is fine they will most likely continue to do the kind of things that upset you. Its okay to be sensitive, and it’s okay to admit it.
capricorn,Find a nice quiet place where you can switch off from the world around you and get your thoughts together. And remember: if you want to find peace in your life as a whole you first need to find it in your own heart and head.
capricorn,Something you have been working on for quite some time needs to be left alone for a while. According to the planets you have got so involved with it that other areas of your life are being neglected. Time to balance things out again.
capricorn,Avoid all forms of negative thinking. If you let even one little doubt enter your mind it will grow alarmingly quickly and before you know it you will think the world is coming to an end. The fact is you have precisely nothing to worry about.
capricorn,If you believe in yourself and work diligently towards a well defined goal there is no reason why your name should not be up in lights – and your bank balance blessed by a large input of cash. It’s really up to you now.
capricorn,Why is it that some people seem to enjoy making life so complicated? Whatever the reason you don’t have to follow their example, so keep things simple today and don’t go searching for complicated answers to what are such straightforward questions.
capricorn,You want to get out and about and explore but chores and duties are holding you back. So ignore them. Will the world come to a premature end if you don’t get certain tasks finished in a particular time frame? Of course not.
capricorn,Others may be buzzing here, there and everywhere changing anything and everything but you are advised to keep your life just the way it is. Change for change’s sake is rarely a good idea and as a Capricorn you know the value of tradition.
capricorn,Turn on the charm and make sure you get your way. Remember too that the best way to get other people to agree with you is to appeal to them on an emotional level. Facts and figures are important, of course, but it’s feelings that tip the balance.
capricorn,Some interesting opportunities are opening up to you but you need to be aware of the fact that they will bring an increase in responsibilities too. You only have so much time and energy to spare, so choose what you use them for carefully.
capricorn,Steer clear of negative thoughts and feelings because once they have got their hooks in you it will take a lot of work to break free again. Everything will work out for the best in the end – somehow it always does – so why be afraid?,capricorn,You can be a bit sarcastic at times and the planets warn that your caustic way with words could have long-term consequences that damage not only others but you as well. Ask yourself this: will your words hurt or will they heal?,capricorn,Something unexpected will happen today and because you like everything to be in its right place and happening at the right time chances are you will be thrown out of your stride. Good. It’s not healthy to get too set in your ways.
capricorn,Any moves you make this weekend must be the result of serious thought and careful consideration. Weigh up all the pros and cons and only take action when you are sure you will be on the winning side. Failing that, take no action at all.
capricorn,Anyone who thinks you can easily be fooled will quickly learn the error of their ways. Monday’s Mercury-Jupiter link warns there are people out there who will try to cheat you, most likely financially, but you are far too smart for them.
capricorn,Pluto, planet of power, turns retrograde in your sign today, which among other things suggests that your grip on certain situations may not be as strong as you thought. In one particular area it may even pay you to let go completely.
capricorn,This is the sort of day when it is probably best to keep your plans to yourself. You don’t have to be dishonest about what you are up to but it will pay you to be evasive. Others have no right to know about your aims and ambitions.
capricorn,You may have to own up to a transgression of some sort today but the moment you do you will feel a lot better for it. You have been carrying a lot of burdens lately, not least the burden of a guilty conscience. Get past it.
capricorn,It would appear that someone you work with has made a mistake and would like nothing better than to blame you for it. Don’t let that happen! They’re not the only ones who can point fingers. Let them know you can play that game too.
capricorn,You don’t seem much in the mood for serious things at the moment, so get any chores that are expected of you out of the way quickly, then devote yourself to the kind of social activities that bring a smile to your face.
capricorn,The Sun’s move into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend is sure to bring a smile to your face. More importantly, it will help you believe that the kind of success you have long dreamed about is now within your grasp. And it is.
capricorn,Life seems more exciting all of a sudden and that’s great. It will be greater still if you find out what is worrying a loved one and do what it takes to put their mind at ease. Then you can have even more fun going places together.
capricorn,If you have learnt anything in recent months it must surely be that getting uptight and throwing tantrums rarely, if ever, changes anything for the better. The best way to resolve differences is to turn on the charm – you’ve got plenty of it.
capricorn,You may be entitled to get angry with someone who has let you down but is it worth the effort? Chances are it would be more sensible to forgive and forget, not least because they will then be in your debt, and that could be useful.
capricorn,Yours may not be the most flexible sign of the zodiac but it will pay you to make an effort to adapt today. You have a great deal going for you at the moment but to make the most of it you need to be less set in your ways.
capricorn,You don’t have to come on strong to make your point – on the contrary, others will be more receptive to what you say if you say it calmly and clearly and with no hint of a threat. They want to believe you, so don’t make it difficult for them.
capricorn,You want to go out and have a good time but you also want to express your feelings openly and honestly. Yes, you can do both. This is the perfect day to use those three magic words “I love you”. Say them as if you mean them.
capricorn,You won’t hesitate to put your own interests first this weekend and there is no good reason why you should not. In fact, the next two or three weeks promise to be special, so know what you want and where to get it, then make it your own.
capricorn,This week’s eclipse in the sympathetic sign of Taurus will inspire you to aim higher than ever before. There are no limits to what you can accomplish and there is no doubt you will be praised to the skies. Will that inflate your ego? Of course!,capricorn,You are full of energy thanks to the approaching eclipse and it’s important that you channel it in constructive directions. Don’t waste your time on projects that are not challenging enough or people who don’t share your vision. Always aim high.
capricorn,You can expect some kind of breakthrough over the next 24 hours, the kind you will remember for years to come. Whatever it is you dream of achieving you know it can be done and you know that this is the time to make it happen.
capricorn,Anything of a creative nature will go well for you but it will go even better if you make an effort to bring other people into your plans. Friends and loved loves want to help you but they don’t want to be seen as invading your space.
capricorn,For some strange reason you seem reluctant to take advantage of an opportunity most people would give their right arm for. Yes, of course, it could go wrong but it could also go stunningly right – and unless you try you will never know.
capricorn,Take difficulties in your stride and find ways to get something constructive from them. The Sun in Taurus at this time of year has a hugely positive effect on your outlook on life. Many of life’s setbacks can easily be turned into blessings.
capricorn,Anyone who thinks you have been taking things too easy of late will no doubt be surprised how busy you are over the next few days. Pluto in your sign makes you incredibly ambitious and it’s never too early to start winning.
capricorn,No, you don’t have to do everything now, immediately, right this very moment. Others may be pushing you to get things done but you must not let them rush you. A job worth doing well is a job worth taking time over.
capricorn,It won’t be long before you get the chance to do something out of the ordinary but for the time being you are advised to be patient. If you make your move too soon the results may not be as good as they could have been.
capricorn,You may be eager for success but don’t forget the many responsibilities that go with it. Remember, once you have committed to do something, once you have signed on the line, you won’t be able to back out of the deal.
capricorn,You have chopped and changed so often in recent weeks that you may no longer be sure which way is up, but that’s okay. On the work front at least you will know without a shadow of a doubt what needs to be done next. So do it.
capricorn,Most things seem to be going well for you at the moment, and that’s good, but the planets warn you must not get too content with your lot and drift along without trying. When things are going good you should be aiming for great!,capricorn,Do what you can to bring people together today but if it proves too tough a task just back off and let them fight it out. Do not, under any circumstances, get involved on a personal level yourself. If you choose sides you’ll be the loser.
capricorn,If you are not already moving up in the world you soon will be. Your rise will be quicker, however, if you are honest with yourself about your weaknesses as well as your strengths. You can bet your rivals are aware of them already.
capricorn,You will receive an offer that sounds pretty good over the next few days but you are advised to find out exactly what will be expected of you before you accept. Make sure you read the small print you don’t want any nasty surprises later on.
capricorn,You seem amazingly open at the moment, not in the least bit reserved, which is great – but watch out you don’t let slip information that it might be sensible to keep to yourself. You don’t have to tell everyone about everything.
capricorn,This is one of the best times of the year for you and you really should be making the most of it. It might not be true to say that anything is possible but most things are, so set your sights high and make greatness your goal.
capricorn,You will be rather forthright in your views today and not everyone will like it. Too bad. Most of the time you keep your opinions to yourself but every now and again you go right the other way and shout them from the rooftops.
capricorn,All sorts of opportunities are opening up for you now but they will be a lot more fun if you invite family and friends to join you on your journey. Make sure what you do for yourself you do also for the people care for.
capricorn,You’ve enjoyed an easy ride in recent weeks and you know that at some stage you will have to pay for it. That stage will most likely arrive when the Sun changes signs on the 21st, so make the most of your freedom.
capricorn,Both at home and at work you must stick up for yourself this weekend. Let everyone know that while you might be a nice guy by nature that does not mean you will allow the world to walk all over you. Tread on a few toes yourself.
capricorn,Pay close attention to details over the next few days, because the smallest of things could trip you up. Also, something that has been a habit longer than you care to remember needs to be junked. It’s holding you back, not holding you up.
capricorn,It may seem as if those around you don’t care about your problems but the fact is few if any of them know how much you have been suffering. If you speak up today you will get the help you need. If you stay quiet, you won’t.
capricorn,There is no point arguing with people in positions of power, especially now that Mars, planet of ambition, is resuming its normal direction. You may not agree with what they are doing but you’d be wise not to shout about it. You’ll get your chance later.
capricorn,As the Sun moves into the work and wellbeing area of your chart today you would be wise to slow things down a bit, even if it means cutting back on your goals. Getting things done quickly is not as important as getting them done right.
capricorn,Don’t be afraid to break the rules today. You may be a straight up sort of person but sometimes even a Capricorn has to take a shortcut to get where they most want to be. So long as it does not hurt other people it’s not immoral.
capricorn,Over the next few days you will have to decide what is worth carrying on with and what needs to be junked. Don’t let sentiment play a part in your decision: put your own needs first and don’t let other people influence you in any way.
capricorn,You will find it remarkably easy to make a positive impression on people in positions of power this weekend and if you are smart you will take full advantage of that fact. You may think of them as special but they think you are special too.
capricorn,Attitude is everything over the next few days. If you approach what you have to do with confidence and a genuine belief that you will enjoy it then you’ll have a great time – and get great results too. Your mind creates your reality.
capricorn,If you feel a bit run down as the new week begins that’s a sure sign you have been overdoing it. Even a Capricorn needs their rest, so put your well being first and don’t worry that you might fall behind. In fact you’re still well ahead.
capricorn,You may be a creature of habit but even you can recognize that certain ways of doing things are not working as well as they should. It’s time to push your ego to one side and admit, if only to yourself, that changes are needed.
capricorn,Keep on doing what you are doing and don’t listen to those who say you should be doing something else. The more others try to pick holes in your plans the more certain you can be that you are on the right track. Keep going.
capricorn,Something you previously found difficult will come easier to you today. You may still have to struggle in other areas but the planets will generally give your spirits a lift and help you believe that most, if not quite all, things are possible.
capricorn,If someone in a position of power says or does something that you disagree with today you would be wise not to let it show. According to the planets you are not yet strong enough to confront them directly, so be smart and keep your distance.
capricorn,The Sun’s link to Mars this weekend will boost both your ambitions and your confidence and that’s a winning combination. On the work front, especially, you will gain new and important admirers, though some may see you as a threat.
capricorn,Keep reminding yourself that you are human and that humans are supposed to make mistakes. Sometimes you can be too demanding of yourself and too critical when things go wrong, as at times they inevitably will. Lighten up – it’s life.
capricorn,Are you working more for other people than you are for yourself? According to the planets you are, so get a grip on the situation and let those who are taking advantage of your generous nature know that’s as far as it goes. And mean it.
capricorn,You will be required to take on more tasks and responsibilities over the next few days and though it may seem as if you are being unfairly restricted there is no doubt you will be repaid in full later in the month. Keep smiling.
capricorn,You will have to make sacrifices above and beyond the call of duty today but the effort will be worth it. Not only do you have enough energy and enthusiasm to get things done for yourself but you will gladly help others as well.
capricorn,Current influences highlight the need to be efficient, to get the most from yourself for the least input of time and energy. Pace yourself sensibly and look for ways, even in the smallest of things, to get from A to B quickly and simply.
capricorn,Your views and opinions may be a little out of the ordinary, maybe even outrageous in some people’s eyes, but no way should you change them. According to the planets they are closer to the truth than you realize, so keep searching.
capricorn,The planets warn you may need to make a special effort to keep your temper in check. If you cannot get along with certain people then at least try to stay out of their way. Hopefully they will stay away from you too.
capricorn,You may look fearless to the world at large but you have worries and anxieties like everyone else and some of them will bubble to the surface over the next few days. Don’t be afraid to question your own motivations.
capricorn,It’s good that you want to put the world to rights but don’t pick fights where they are not really necessary. Before getting involved in other people’s affairs you should always ask yourself what the chances are of doing more harm than good.
capricorn,You may find it hard to feel sorry for someone who has clearly brought their difficulties on themselves but if they approach you for help today you won’t turn them away. Beneath that tough exterior beats a heart of gold.
capricorn,If you live in dread of things that might never happen you will almost certainly miss out on something that would have made life a lot more exciting and a lot more rewarding. Don’t try to avoid life – celebrate it in all it’s glory.
capricorn,There is a danger that you will go to extremes today and start believing that nothing bad can possibly happen. That kind of thinking is guaranteed to set off a cosmic chain of events designed to remind you that few things are written in stone.
capricorn,You may not be able to make much sense of what is happening at the moment but don’t worry – you are not the only one who is having a hard time getting a grip on reality. Once the full moon starts to fade all will be revealed.
capricorn,Important people are watching you closely and with Mars inspiring you to be more dynamic on the career front you are sure to make an impression. But will it be the right impression? Whatever else you do, don’t lose your temper.
capricorn,Someone you work with has made a mistake and is looking for someone on whom they can pin the blame. Don’t let it be you. If they start pointing the finger in your direction you must point back and fight back. Don’t be the fall guy.
capricorn,You will have to accept more of a supporting role over the next few days but it’s no big deal. Capricorn is a cardinal sign, which means you like to take the lead, but sometimes it’s better to let others take responsibility.
capricorn,Ignore people who say that certain things cannot or should not be done. If you feel that a course of action is right for you then there is nothing more that needs to be said. Pay attention only to what your inner voice tells you.
capricorn,A Venus-Jupiter link is about as good an influence as you could hope for, especially where your love life is concerned. You will meet some interesting people today and one in particular could become much more than just a friend.
capricorn,If you don’t feel in the mood for working today don’t push yourself. Even if you force yourself to do what is expected of you it’s unlikely you’ll make a good job of it, so wait until you are in a more positive frame of mind.
capricorn,You seem to have resigned yourself to the idea that you will have to take a loss on something that just hasn’t been working out the way you planned. Don’t be too hasty. What happens today and over the weekend will cheer you up no end.
capricorn,The Sun moves into your opposite sign of Cancer today, meaning you are almost at the midpoint between one birthday and the next. Consequently, this is a good time to take stock of how far you have come – and how far you still have to go.
capricorn,It would be nice if others would change their ways to accommodate your needs but it isn’t going to happen. Stop daydreaming and start doing the things that will move your life in the direction you want it to go. It’s all down to you.
capricorn,Try not to make too much of a fuss if someone with whom you live, work or do business makes a mess of what they do today. Not everyone can be as super efficient as you, so make allowances and make sure, if it’s important, you do it yourself next time,capricorn,Decide what it is you need to accomplish, then set about it with energy and self-belief. No matter how many disappointments you have suffered in recent weeks the planets indicate that from here on it will be success all the way.
capricorn,The planets warn if you don’t make a decision soon about a career matter it will be taken out of your hands. Don’t get too hung up on available choices – whatever you go for will work out well for you in the end.
capricorn,Take what happens today as a challenge rather than as a setback. Everything that occurs in your life – including things you tend to think of as “bad” – has a meaning behind it and a lesson to be learned. Fate is rarely unkind.
capricorn,A new moon in your opposite sign of Cancer means that partners and loved ones will be full of themselves over the next 24 hours. Instead of getting angry about it why don’t you join in the fun? You can be too serious you know!,capricorn,You may want to cut yourself off from the world for a while but you know that isn’t possible. There is so much going on that your only realistic option is to get more involved. Problems are there to be solved.
capricorn,You will be asking yourself some important questions this week and the answers will come quicker than you expected. Where your career is concerned you may find it pays to aim a little lower. You don’t have to be top dog every time.
capricorn,You need to get your everyday affairs in order but to do that you will need to be more ruthless than you have been of late. Anything that distracts you from your aims must be cut out of your life altogether. That includes people too.
capricorn,Try not to say things merely to get a reaction because you may get the kind of feedback that does not meet with your approval. Partners and colleagues will be rather touchy over the next 24 hours, so either say nice things or keep quiet.
capricorn,What a friend has to tell you today may not be what you were hoping to hear but the important thing is it’s what you need to hear. Are you smart enough to realize you don’t know all the answers? If so, you’re smarter than most.
capricorn,As Venus, planet of harmony, is moving through the area of your chart that governs your wellbeing it might be wise to take things easy today. That’s easy by Capricorn standards, of course. People will still get exhausted just watching you.
capricorn,There is no point trying to force the pace because the Sun opposing Pluto in your sign won’t let you – and will also remind you where the real power lies. Also, focus on finishing what has already been started. Save new projects for another day.
capricorn,You need to be careful this weekend, especially on the work front where you could damage your long-term prospects if you let your feelings get the better of you. No matter what is said or done you must not rise to the bait.
capricorn,You may not be the sort to run from a fight but the planets warn it might be better to avoid trouble rather than face it head on over the next few days. Pick your battles carefully. In other words, pick the ones you know you can win.
capricorn,Every once in a while you do something that shocks even those who know you well and the planets suggest you will go out of your way to be controversial today. Tomorrow, no doubt, you will be making apologies left, right and center.
capricorn,You like to take your time with new ideas but if you do that today you could miss out on a glorious opportunity. The first idea that comes into your head is the idea you must follow, no matter how silly it might seem to begin with.
capricorn,You don’t need to change direction, no matter what certain people might say. You are where you are meant to be and you are following the path that was designed for you and you alone. Stay on it. You’ll get where you most need to be.
capricorn,Although the approaching full moon is making you anxious everything will come right in the end – it almost always does. The so-called “bad” things that happen in life are often challenges designed to help you grow emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
capricorn,Your energy may take a bit of a dip over the next 24 hours but don’t let it worry you because compared to most people you are still on red hot form. Limit yourself to what is truly important. Nothing matters more than your No.1 aim.
capricorn,Today’s full moon in your sign will make you more emotional than usual and that could cause problems. Be aware – and accept – that not everyone sees things the same way as you, nor is there any logical reason why they should.
capricorn,It’s time to sort out a money matter or business issue that has been causing you sleepless nights. There is no point getting angry or making threats because that will only make matters worse. If you are reasonable others will be reasonable too.
capricorn,Stay cool and look for ways to turn new developments to your advantage. If you can do that this should be an amazingly productive time for you. Listen to other people’s suggestions too, even though they may not always be to your liking.
capricorn,Don’t feel bad if life seems to be rather low key just now. You may be on the down side of the slope at the moment but things are sure to pick up as the week progresses. Be patient and wait for your chance to shine.
capricorn,You can feel your confidence beginning to return and by the end of the week you will have forgotten that you ever doubted yourself. Your ability to make things happen is still there, so identify your goals and work resolutely towards them.
capricorn,The only way you are going to get what you desire is to communicate with those who can help you. Co-operate with them fully and make sure their needs are catered for as well as your own. There’s more than enough good stuff to go around.
capricorn,You are in a romantic mood at the moment and that’s good. The only danger is that you will put the object of your affection on too high a pedestal and feel devastated when, inevitably, they take a tumble. They’re human, just like you.
capricorn,If someone says something you don’t much like you must resist the urge to get angry about it. If you get uptight they will play on your emotions all the more. If you pretend you don’t care they will most likely leave you alone.
capricorn,You don’t have to suffer in silence if you think you have been hard done by. Speak up and let everyone know you deserve a bigger share of the pie. They may not agree with you but at least you will have started a dialogue.
capricorn,Don’t run yourself into the ground doing things for other people. It’s great that you are so enthusiastic but your energy supply is limited and must be saved for those things that mean something to you personally. Be a bit selfish.
capricorn,As of today you will no longer be satisfied with superficial explanations. You want to know what is really going on, both in your personal life and in the world at large. Dig beneath the surface. Look behind the scenes. The truth is out there.
capricorn,You are entitled to your opinion and you are entitled to be heard but if you think everyone is going to agree with you chances are you will be disappointed. The world would be a dull place indeed if we all thought the same way.
capricorn,It’s not often you probe the deepest corners of your mind but over the next 24 hours you will start asking some rather profound questions. The answers that come up are not being discovered for the first time – you knew them already.
capricorn,You must resist the temptation to look at the world as if everything that happens is a disaster or a tragedy. That kind of thinking tends to be self-fulfilling. Focus only on good news today and soon life will look grand again.
capricorn,It would not be wise to take chances with money this weekend but, on the other hand, you should make far-reaching plans. The course of action you decide on now will pay dividends later on but don’t be tempted by risky investments.
capricorn,You will receive good news over the next few days, news that will cheer you up no end. Maybe things are not as bad as you tend to believe. Maybe Lady Luck is smiling on you after all. Maybe you should smile more!,capricorn,What you hear today may not exactly thrill you, but neither is at as bad as some people are trying to make out, so don’t overreact. A negative thought is a powerful thing and can easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Always be positive.
capricorn,Something you are working on would benefit from a second opinion this weekend. If you want it to be a success you must listen to advice from those who have been there and done it before you. You can and must learn from their mistakes.
capricorn,Don’t come on too strong today or you could turn people against you and, in doing so, damage both your reputation and your earning power. You may think you can get away with almost anything but it isn’t true. Be assertive but be smart too.
capricorn,It may seem as if others are trying to make life difficult for you but more likely you are making life difficult for yourself. What happens in the world “out there” depends so much on what goes on inside your head. Think about it.
capricorn,You have a bit of an obsession with perfection but you need to remember that not everyone shares it. It’s good to feel that you are in control but if you take it too far today you might tempt certain people to be obstructive.
capricorn,There is a lot of gossip going around and quite a bit of it seems to be about you. This is one of those times when you should close your ears to what others are saying and do only what you want to do. Nothing else matters.
capricorn,You will find it easy to come and go as you please this week but not everyone will be pleased with your new found sense of freedom. But so what? Do what you want to do and don’t let fear of disapproval hold you back.
capricorn,As mind planet Mercury makes a less than positive link with Neptune, planet of deception, today you could be right to suspect that the deal you’ve been offered is a dud. If there is the slightest doubt in your mind you must turn it down.
capricorn,You are more likely to find answers to your problems if you get creative and look in areas you tend to neglect. You also need to get some input from loved ones and relatives. You don’t have to do it all on your own.
capricorn,You seem to have got it into your head that the best way to solve a problem is to throw money at it. All you will succeed in doing is wasting even more of your precious resources, so think again. There’s plenty you can do for free.
capricorn,There is so much going on in the world at the moment that you may be having trouble making sense of it all but if you keep your eyes and ears open today you will see or hear something that gives you the guidance you seek. Stay sharp.
capricorn,Like everyone else you have fears that can hold you back from fulfilling your potential, but today’s influences will help you confront them and overcome them. There is always a rational explanation for things that go bump in the night.
capricorn,Usually you are careful what you say but over the next 48 hours you will go right the other way and say exactly what you think and feel. You won’t lose any friends though – in fact others will find your frankness refreshing.
capricorn,A full moon in the money area of your chart means you won’t see eye-to-eye with someone over a business or financial matter. Ultimately though it’s no big deal, so give it time and the situation should resolve itself to your benefit.
capricorn,You may not care all that much what is going on in the wider world but at some stage today you will have to wake up to the fact that outside events have a big impact on you. Try to be a bit more outgoing this week.
capricorn,The current cosmic picture will reinforce your determination to transform your existence but it won’t be until the Sun moves in your favor on the 23rd that you can really get started. In the meantime, be patient. Your time will come.
capricorn,You will clash with someone over money today. Your first instinct will be to fight to get back what is yours but after a while you may come to the conclusion that it’s not worth the effort. If it’s gone, just make some more.
capricorn,You will be asked to do a favor today for someone you don’t like very much but if you are smart you will do it with a smile. The fact is they have a lot of power and you could make yourself a useful ally.
capricorn,Avoid get-rich-quick schemes this weekend because most likely they will cost you a fortune. The planets warn if you take silly risks you will pay for it in a big way, maybe not straight away but certainly before the end of the month.
capricorn,By all means speak your mind but try not to say things that could be taken the wrong way. You may not mean to be rude but sometimes you can be rather blunt in your assessment of what is right and what is wrong.
capricorn,Friendships and finances are well starred today, so arrange a trip of some kind – maybe a shopping expedition – with your best friend. You won’t have to spend a fortune to make yourself feel good, but you probably will!,capricorn,Someone will rub you in the wrong way today and you may find it hard to control your tempter. Keeping telling yourself they are not worth the effort and keep doing what you are doing only more so. That will really annoy them!,capricorn,You appear to have pushed yourself a bit too hard, physically and mentally, of late and now you are beginning to feel the effects. If that’s the case then you must give yourself a break. Never mind about your work – it can wait.
capricorn,There are some things that need to be said and Pluto in your sign, linked to communications planet Mercury, will help you find just the right words. Don’t concern yourself with other people’s feelings, concern yourself only with the truth.
capricorn,Something will happen over the next two or three days that forces you to the front of the stage where everyone can see you. You may not want to be a star but the planets, it seems, are making it happen. Why not enjoy it?,capricorn,You have been under a lot of pressure of late but as from today the pressure will ease and very soon you will be back to your best. Whatever problems you have been struggling with don’t give them another thought – they’re simply not worth it.
capricorn,You may be tempted to bend the rules to get what you desire but there is really no need. Everything is going well for you and will go even better when the moon is new tomorrow. The universe is very much on your side at the moment.
capricorn,Do you have the courage to take a different course between now and the end of the year? According to the planets there will be rewards aplenty if you do but your conservative nature could hold you back. Go on, you knowyou want to!,capricorn,You want to do something special today, something that marks you out as a cut above the rest. Make sure, however, that it is something constructive, something that benefits others as well as yourself. It’s okay to be famous, but not infamous.
capricorn,The best way to boost your confidence is to tackle tasks that require total concentration. The less time you have to worry about your problems the more likely it is they will resolve themselves. Very soon you’ll be back to your best.
capricorn,The Sun in Virgo will make it easy to excel creatively, and maybe have a good time romantically as well, so be on the lookout for new opportunities. Something as simple as a smile could set you on an exciting new journey.
capricorn,You may think you know how to put the world to rights but you also need to be aware that you cannot force other people to follow your lead. Make it your aim this weekend to be a good example – then you’ll make a difference.
capricorn,There will always be those who try to talk you down but you must not let their negative words affect what you do. Nothing and no one can stop you from realizing your goals, so ignore the critics and be brilliant in every way.
capricorn,You seem to be under quite a bit of pressure on the work front at the moment but over the next few days that pressure will ease. If nothing else you will see where it is coming from and take steps to calm things down a bit.
capricorn,If a friend or family member is in trouble today you will ride to their rescue no questions asked. However, while you can be generous with your time and sympathy you must be careful with your money. Don’t give it all away.
capricorn,Actions speak louder than words and with Pluto in your sign activated by the Sun you will be all action from the moment you awake to the moment your head hits the pillow tonight. Nothing is beyond you. You’ll make the impossible look easy.
capricorn,No matter how tough the challenges that come your way from now until the end of the year you will handle them all with ease – that’s the message from the stars. Take each day as it comes and accept that it’s already perfect in every way.
capricorn,Travel is very much on your mind at the moment and it’s quite likely you will be going somewhere distant or out of the ordinary. Contacts with foreigners are especially helpful at this time – you could even end up working abroad.
capricorn,You may feel confident, even a bit cocky, at the moment but don’t take too much for granted. The planets warn that a minor setback could easily grow into something big, so stay alert and be the first to act if a crisis kicks-off.
capricorn,There are so many changes taking place in your life and most of them are good, so don’t try to resist them. There are times when you can’t put a foot wrong even if you try and this, it seems, is one of them.
capricorn,Try not to be so intense over the next 24 hours. The planets urge you to take your foot off the gas and cruise for a while. You should know by now you get just as much done with a smile on your face as with a scowl.
capricorn,You are of the opinion that standards have slipped and you intend doing something about it. Before trying to change others though maybe you should take a look at yourself. How can you improve your own performance and be a better example?,capricorn,You want to get as much done as is physically possible but the planets warn you could easily over-extend yourself or, worse, exhaust yourself well before you have reached your target. What’s the rush? The work will still be there tomorrow.
capricorn,Join forces with people who share your concerns, then decide what you can do to make the world a better place. You still need to realize though that lasting change takes time and commitment. Few worthwhile things can be gained overnight.
capricorn,There comes a time when the old must give way to the new and according to the planets you are approaching that time now. Don’t worry. Changes are good for you. Changes will benefit you. Changes are just what you need.
capricorn,For some strange reason you fear the worst but on this occasion fear can be a positive thing in that it will lead you to reappraise your long-term aims. Are you moving in the right direction? Chances are you are not, so get ready to make major changes.
capricorn,By all means look back and work out why certain things went wrong but once you have done so you should forget about them once and for all. Each day is different and each day brings new possibilities, so live for today, and in the moment.
capricorn,Why are you worrying for no good reason? The planets suggest that nothing will happen without your agreement and your say-so, so lighten up and try not to be so defensive about life. If it’s not fun then you’re not doing it right.
capricorn,Jupiter in the wealth area of your chart puts you in a strong position where anything of a financial nature is concerned. If a deal of some sort has to be made you should be the one calling the shots – and taking the lion’s share of the profits.
capricorn,Open your eyes to new possibilities – then take advantage of them. Too often in the past you have been content to let life come to you, but now you must push yourself forward at every opportunity. Success comes to those who dare.
capricorn,Don’t waste time on petty arguments when there are so many important matters that require your attention. Not everyone you meet over the next 24 hours will see things from your point of view but that’s okay. There’s room enough for every opinion.
capricorn,You may be having a great deal of fun but have you considered the consequences which could arise from some of your more impulsive actions? Take time out today to think about what you are doing and why. Tone down your act a bit.
capricorn,Don’t waste your time trying to get other people to think and act like you – it’s not going to happen. You demand the right to be different so you should allow them to be different too – variety is what makes the world such an interesting place.
capricorn,Nothing can be allowed to restrict your movements or stop you from exploring the world around you. Look for meaning in everything you see, hear and do over the next two or three days. You may find more than you expected. ,capricorn,What happens over the next few days will have a big impact on your career and your professional reputation. For that reason alone you must do the best work you possibly can and make sure the powers that be can see how talented you are.
capricorn,Some of the people you meet today will want to hear what you think about what’s going on in the world – so tell them. They may be surprised how outspoken you are but nothing gets changed by silence – and they did ask after all!,capricorn,Today’s new moon will be good for your social standing generally and for career matters especially. However, when dealing with employers and other important people you must be honest about your experience and qualifications. Don’t make things up.
capricorn,Partnership problems of one sort or another may be causing you concern but there is no reason to fear the worst. Certain relationships have fallen into a rut and need to be revitalized. What is painful in the short-term will be useful in the long-term.
capricorn,You have been keeping to yourself a lot in recent days and friends and family members are beginning to wonder why. Put their minds at rest by telling them your plans. Just because you’ve been quiet does not mean you’ve been doing nothing.
capricorn,Be wary of people who ask a lot of questions over the next 48 hours. According to the planets they think you know things that could benefit them, and maybe you do, but why should you give it away for free? Information is power. ,capricorn,Someone you distrust will greet you in an excessively friendly way during the early part of the week but you won’t be fooled for a moment. You know they are after something and whatever it is you have no intention of giving it to them.
capricorn,Exciting things are happening in your life and most likely you will be making serious gains between now and the end of the week. Career opportunities will come knocking but, as always, it is up to you whether you make good use of them.
capricorn,You are in a serious mood at the moment and may even be searching for the meaning of life. Chances are you won’t have to look far: something that takes place right in front if you will answer all those deep question you have been asking.
capricorn,What you need to remember today is that no matter how well you do in life and no matter how high up the ladder you climb there will always someone bigger and badder than you. In other words: know when you’ve met your match.
capricorn,Even the most ambitious of Capricorns will be at peace with the world today. No matter how much you are provoked you cannot be bothered to react. Tomorrow, though, will be a different story. Some people may regret their choice of words.
capricorn,Your feelings about a career matter are spot on, so listen to your instincts and act on what they tell you. You may be swimming against the tide of opinion at the moment but later on everyone will come round to your way of thinking.
capricorn,You will learn a painful lesson this weekend but fortunately the pain will belong to someone else! What they are going through could so easily happen to you, so work out what they did wrong and promise yourself that you won’t make the same mistake.
capricorn,You can sense that something major is about to happen but you don’t know what it is. Because of this you may be somewhat apprehensive over the next few days but come the end of the week you’ll have found the answers you seek.
capricorn,If you are happy with your social standing that’s great. If not, start thinking about how you would like to change the way you are seen by the world. The approaching eclipse will turn so many things upside down – and for you that’s an opportunity.
capricorn,If you acknowledge your weaknesses now you will be operating from a position of strength later in the week. There is nothing wrong in admitting you are inadequate in certain areas – it means you know where improvements need to be made.
capricorn,Today’s lunar eclipse in the career area of your chart is a powerful omen and if you are anywhere near as ambitious as people think you are you will go all out to start moving up in the world. First though you need to discard your own self-doubts.
capricorn,Communication won’t be easy over the next 24 hours, and when you do seem to get a straight answer from someone you may not be able to trust it. Keep what you want to say for another day – if it’s that important it will wait.
capricorn,Today’s Sun-Jupiter link means you may find it hard to show restraint when dealing with matters of a financial or business nature, but that’s okay. Usually you are totally in control of yourself, so by all means go to the other extreme – just this once.
capricorn,Someone may deserve to be criticized for something they said or did but if you are smart you will resist the urge to get angry and let them know you don’t hold a grudge. They will feel indebted to you and that’s an IOU worth having.
capricorn,If you want to know what is going on over the next few days, both at work and in your social group, you must be more open about your own thoughts and feelings. Others will open up to you if you open up to them first.
capricorn,You may be a small fish in a big pond but your reputation for integrity and excellence are such that even the big fish respect you. Someone in a position of power will come to you for assistance today. You’re more important than you realize.
capricorn,While it may be true that much of what you do in life depends at least in part on other people, there are still many things over which you have total control. One of them is the way you choose to react to events. Be positive and smile often.
capricorn,All work and no play is rarely a good idea and if you go down that route now you may look back later and wish you had been a bit more relaxed about life. Find ways to get others to do things for you and give yourself a break.
capricorn,It would appear that someone, somewhere has been telling lies about you or in some other way putting you down. Find out who it is and who they have talked to and make sure you put the record straight before important people start to believe them.
capricorn,A partnership or relationship issue can easily be resolved today, IF you are prepared to sit down and listen to the other person’s grievances. What you need to realize is that it’s not all about you – they have their dreams and worries as well.
capricorn,If you want something badly enough you can get it with not too much effort but with the Sun and Venus both moving in your favor on Thursday you won’t have to make any effort at all later in the week. Others will do it all for you.
capricorn,The news you receive today may not be entirely to your liking but you will still have plenty of time to adjust. Patience is not only a virtue but a necessity if you are to make significant progress over the next few weeks.
capricorn,You have to make a decision that affects not only your own life but the lives of friends and family and loved ones as well. Think carefully before making your move – then make it decisively knowing that the universe is behind you all the way.
capricorn,Let your imagination roam far and wide over the next two or three days. An idea that pops into your head out of nowhere may seem outrageous but if you think about it a bit you will realize there is no reason why it cannot be your reality.
capricorn,The Sun in Scorpio over the next few weeks will present you with numerous opportunities to showcase your talent and creativity. Don’t copy what others have done before, be original and come up with something new and inspiring.
capricorn,Have you recently taken a decisive step, one that could have a huge effect on the working pattern of your life? If so you are advised to stop and think about it some more. There is still time to change your mind. Nothing is written in stone yet.
capricorn,Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moves into your sign this weekend, where it remains until early December. That means you have just over a month to really push yourself in pursuit of your dreams. Don’t just plan your next move – make it.
capricorn,No matter how far-fetched an idea may seem it will nag at you until you do something about it. Now that mind planet Mercury is moving in your favor again you will find it easy to see what is and is not possible. So think – then act.
capricorn,Nothing and no one can beat or defeat you if you remain focused on your number one objective. Those who oppose you will place all kinds of obstacles in your path over the next few days but you will smash through them all with ease.
capricorn,You must deliver on a promise you made a while ago, even if it means you have to change your plans or miss out on a social event you were looking forward to. Your reputation could nosedive if you fail to deliver.
capricorn,Others will rush this way and that way today trying to get on top of things but you will take it all in your stride. Just make sure you don’t get so laidback about life in general that you neglect certain responsibilities.
capricorn,You may know what is wrong with a certain situation but you are not yet in a position to put it right. In fact, the planets warn quite strongly you should leave well alone. The cosmic picture will change dramatically over the next few days.
capricorn,Take it easy this weekend. It’s okay to let slide what others say should be done immediately. In fact, a short break now will refresh your senses and put you in the right frame of mind to tackle major issues early next week.
capricorn,Try not to get hot under the collar if you discover that a friend has been using your name to get things done. Maybe you should be flattered. The fact that others take notice when your name is mentioned shows hoe well thought of you are.
capricorn,Don’t allow others to talk you into doing something that will tie you down for weeks or even months at a time. You have your own interests and your own goals to pursue and you must put them first, today and every day from now on. ,capricorn,How hungry are you for success? If you are typical of your birth sign you are very hungry indeed and what you achieve between now and the end of the year will be little short of extraordinary. Show the world what you are capable of.
capricorn,Resist the urge to make any kind of snap decision today. The Sun at odds with Uranus means you should proceed with caution, both in your private life and in your work. You don’t need upheaval, you need calm. ,capricorn,If you try to accommodate each and every viewpoint or opinion over the next 24 hours you are likely to alienate everyone. First impressions are the most reliable, so go with your instincts and back those whose outlook you feel an affinity for.
capricorn,If you want to impress a loved one today you should try something original, exciting and totally unexpected. Your relationship may have fallen into a bit of a rut of late but your feelings for each other are still there, and still worth fighting for.
capricorn,Believe it or not this is one of the best times of the year for you. The only danger is you could spoil it by negative thinking that comes not from your own mind but from the influence of people around you. Think only positive thoughts today. ,capricorn,Several surprises lie in store for you over the next few days. Don’t pretend to be shocked if a friend or family member acts in ways you consider to be outrageous – you should know from past experience that they like to provoke reaction.
capricorn,You may feel that you can take on the world and win, and maybe you can, but why make a war of life when you don’t have to? Today’s Mars-Pluto union in your sign endows your personality with power. Just ask for what you want – you’ll get it.
capricorn,There will be good news today, the kind that has been lacking in recent weeks. You may not be able to act on what you learn straight away but at least you know there is something inspiring to look forward to in the near future. ,capricorn,Whatever else you do today don’t lose your temper. Even if you have a right to be annoyed you must keep your feelings to yourself. You will be able to express your views in a more positive fashion on Friday and over the weekend.
capricorn,You have a tendency to work harder than most other people but with the Sun at odds with Jupiter today you could go too far and exhaust yourself. Even a Capricorn needs to take it easy once in a while, so schedule some down time – and enjoy it.
capricorn,You are so close to fulfilling an ambition that you may be a bit fearful that something will go wrong at the very last moment. Don’t worry, it won’t. Even if you encounter an obstacle this weekend your momentum will carry you through.
capricorn,Take advantage of an opportunity that has been around for ages without anyone making the most of it. Tuesday’s link between the Sun and your ruling planet Saturn could bring you fame and fortune but you’ve got to act quickly.
capricorn,You may find it hard to cut back on your social life but you know you have to if you are to make the most of a business opportunity. Friends may be disappointed that you can’t come out to play but there will be other times.
capricorn,You may think if you take a risk it will pay off but can you be certain? Unless you are 100 per cent sure of the outcome you should play safe, at least for the next few days. Saturday’s new moon will turn the tide in your favor. ,capricorn,What you do today is maybe not so important, but how you do it certainly is. Throw yourself into a task or a project or a relationship 100 per cent – give it everything you’ve got. Your passion will do your reputation no harm at all.
capricorn,What takes place today and over the weekend will reassure you that things are not as bad as they seem and some of the more serious problems that have plagued you in recent weeks will no longer worry you at all. Time to toughen up.
capricorn,If your instincts tell you a different story to the one that everyone else says is true then trust your inner voice. In the age of mass communication there are times when mass illusion rules and this appears to be one of them. Don’t be fooled. ,capricorn,Capricorns can be remarkably sensitive at times but they can also be remarkably strong and over the next seven days your inner strength will be needed on a number of occasions. Others will need to rely on you and you won’t let them down.
capricorn,Don’t worry too much about the purpose of what you are doing – if it makes you happy that is purpose enough. Life may be a serious business but that does not mean you can’t have fun once in a while – like right now. ,capricorn,There is a pattern to recent events and if you look carefully you will see what it is. Forces outside your control have been guiding you in a new direction but that is no bad thing. If you go with the flow you will enjoy the ride.
capricorn,The more passionately someone tries to convince you of their honesty the more likely it is they want something from you. There may be a sucker born every minute but you don’t have to be one of them. Keep your money in your pocket. ,capricorn,If you have been feeling a bit left out of things lately, don’t worry – what happens today, tomorrow and over the weekend will clue you in to what’s going on and maybe even give you a starring role. You’re never out of the limelight for long!,capricorn,A parting of the ways may be necessary but it does not have to be painful. The simple fact is you have moved on and so have they, but in different directions. That’s okay. Life is a learning experience and you have learned plenty from each other.
capricorn,Strive to be positive this weekend, even if the challenges that face you are daunting. The fact is you have been in this kind of situation many times before and come through unscathed and there is no reason why this time should be different. ,capricorn,You may look happy and confident but deep down you are worried about a financial matter. The good news is that when Mars moves into the money area of your chart in midweek you will find the motivation to sort it out once and for all.
capricorn,Something you see or hear over the next 24 hours will inspire you to do more with your life. In a nutshell: if someone who does not possess your talents and advantages can be such a huge success then so can you. ,capricorn,The task you have set yourself may be tough but you will find ways to make a success of it. Nothing and no one can beat you so long as you remember that challenge and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. ,capricorn,Attitude is everything today and if you approach a troublesome situation in a negative frame of mind you will probably find yourself on the losing side. A positive attitude won’t solve all your problems, of course, but it will certainly help.
capricorn,You are in one of your rare extravagant moods and are determined to indulge yourself, no matter what the cost may be. A few days from now you may regret spending so much on so little, but for now you really don’t care. ,capricorn,Try not to focus on details today because if you do you could miss the bigger picture. There is a lot going on behind the scenes at the moment and you will need to look both far and deep to stay one step ahead of your rivals. ,capricorn,Try not to let your attention wander. Routine matters may be easy to ignore but they will be difficult to put right if you let things slide. There are no shortcuts to success – only consistent effort will earn you the recognition you crave.
capricorn,Don’t be too critical of someone today because later in the week you will need their assistance and they are unlikely to give it if they think you have been too hard on them. There must be something about them you can praise.
capricorn,You need to put your financial house in order, Yes, you will have to make cutbacks, and maybe even sacrifice something you think of as essential to your wellbeing, but in the long-term it will be worth it. On this occasion, less means more. ,capricorn,The entry of love planet Venus into your sign today means you can expect good news concerning a long-term relationship. No matter what difficulties you may be going through now they will ease over the next few days, so lighten up. ,capricorn,The most important thing now is that you get your financial house in order and cut back on activities that waste both your time and your money. You know what they are and you know what needs to be done, so get cracking!,capricorn,You may be conservative by nature but that does not mean you cannot change your ways and if you feel that a change is necessary you must make it immediately. You don’t change often but when you do you go all the way.
capricorn,You are worrying too much – again. The trouble with worrying, of course, is that it tends to create negative vibrations, which in turn make it more likely that what you fear the most will come about. Strive to be positive.
capricorn,You may not feel entirely confident in taking on a task you have not been trained for but don’t let that stop you. Act as if you know what you are doing and you will be surprised to discover that it’s really quite easy.
capricorn,Try not to come on too strong today because you could push away people who should be your friends and allies. Authority figures will be more impressed if you balance your drive and determination with a large dose of self awareness.
capricorn,As Mercury moves into your birth sign today you are advised to put a name to your dreams. If there is something you desire now is as good a time as any to be open about it. Your lucky stars could make it happen. ,capricorn,The new moon on the 22nd – a day after the Sun moves into your birth sign – will do wonders for your courage and confidence. Between now and then though you are advised to keep a low profile. Save your energy for when it is most needed. ,capricorn,You may think that certain people have got it in for you but more likely it’s your imagination playing tricks on you. According to the planets you have nothing at all to fear – and everything in the world to look forward to.
capricorn,The old solar year is almost over and, more importantly, a new one is about to begin. The Sun’s entry into your sign tomorrow won’t solve all your problems at once but it will put them in perspective. They’re not really problems at all. ,capricorn,Tomorrow’s new moon in your sign makes this the perfect time to make resolutions for the coming year. Don’t wait for new year’s day like everyone else – decide what it is you want most out of life then promise yourself that you will get it.
capricorn,You can expect some wonderful things to happen this week. Today’s new moon in your sign makes this one of the very best times of the year, especially for creative endeavors and affairs of the heart. Tackle life head on – and love every moment!,capricorn,The tougher the task the more you like it but with your ruler Saturn now moving into the most sensitive area of your chart those tasks won’t always be physical in nature. Get your head together and everything else will fall into place.
capricorn,For best results you should try to be on the move today. If you stay in the same place you could miss out on something special, something that could turn an average day into a wonderful day. Get moving and see where fate takes you. ,capricorn,Time spent helping others will not be time wasted – in fact you will benefit too in a number of ways. Someone in your family or social circle desperately needs assistance but is too proud to ask. Luckily you’re the sort who likes to help out. ,capricorn,You really should be doing more with your talents. You have what it takes to make a significant mark on the world, so stop hiding in the shadows and step into the light. Do something out of the ordinary and get people talking. ,capricorn,The year may be drawing to a close but that does not mean that you should be winding down. On the contrary, there is still so much for you to do. Push yourself even harder this weekend. Create something that is made to last.
capricorn,This is always a special time of year for you but with so much positive cosmic activity as you head into the new year the next few days could be stupendous. Don’t limit your dreams in any way. Believe in them and make them come true.
capricorn,Although the Sun is moving through your birth sign something tells you this is not a good day to take chances, not least because you find it hard to separate fact from fiction. Give it a few days and you can take all the chances you want.
capricorn,You can sense that something extraordinary is about to happen and you are right, it is. It will be more extraordinary still if you throw off your Capricorn caution and push yourself above and beyond your accepted limits. In reality you have no limits.
capricorn,No one is out to get you, so stop looking over your shoulder at every turn. The state of mind you begin the new year in is the state of mind that will stay with you throughout 2015, so be positive. It’s really all good. ,capricorn,Take things easy today because come the weekend the pace of life is going to pick up considerably. Give both your mind and body a rest after the exertions of the past few weeks. Your emotions could do with a cooling off period too. ,capricorn,The words you use are always important but they have added power at the moment, so think about what it is you most want to accomplish then say what needs to be said to move you closer to that goal. Be loud and proud.
capricorn,You will learn something important from someone you meet socially over the next 48 hours. They may love themselves a little too much for your liking but if you play them along you will learn something to your long-term advantage. ,capricorn,A full moon in your opposite sign means you need to deal with a relationship issue that isn’t going to go away on its own. Be honest about what it is you expect of the other person – and demand they be honest with you too. ,capricorn,You may be in a positive mood at the moment but not everyone is so fortunate and one particular person desperately needs cheering up. Whatever it is that is wrong help them see it is of no real consequence. You’ll soon have them smiling again. ,capricorn,You may worry that you have fallen behind in your schedule but the planets indicate there is plenty of time to catch up. Both in your personal life and at work make this a day of thinking and planning rather than doing. ,capricorn,For some strange reason you appear to believe that everyone thinks and feels the same as you but what occurs over the next day or two will put you right. It really doesn’t matter if others disagree with you – you can still be friends.
capricorn,Someone in a position of authority is not convinced that you have what it takes to do a certain task, but you will delight in proving them wrong. Have faith in yourself and give 100 per cent. Come tomorrow they will be your biggest fan. ,capricorn,You are in a generous mood at the moment, the kind of mood where you would do almost anything for almost anyone. Notice the word “almost” though. It seems there is still one person you can’t bring yourself to be nice to.
capricorn,You will have all sorts of great ideas this week. Not only that but you will actively look for ways to turn those ideas into realities. Hopefully no one will be foolish enough to try to stop you. If they do it could get messy.
capricorn,You will meet some interesting people over the next few days and that’s good because your focus has been too narrow of late. Chances are you will learn something to your advantage too, so keep your eyes and ears open.
capricorn,Partnerships and relationships are under good stars today but you will only feel the benefit if you make an effort to think – and feel – outside your usual range. It’s not about us versus them, it’s about us and them together. ,capricorn,What you most need to realize now is that it is not your job to please someone else – it is their job to please you. Partners and loved ones know exactly what it is you desire – all you have to do is let them give it to you. ,capricorn,Travel and social activities are well starred at the moment but watch out you don’t stray too far in the wrong direction. It’s one thing to be adventurous but quite another to be foolhardy, so make sure you always know where you are going.
capricorn,If you gamble on something and win today you would be wise not to go any further. The planets warn that once you are ahead the only way you will stay ahead is by calling it a day and playing safe again.
capricorn,This is an extremely important time for you, not least because the Sun leaves your sign in just three days time. Something you started a few weeks ago must be finished now. If you let it drag on it may never get done. ,capricorn,You have so many good ideas rattling around inside your head but now you need to get serious and decide which of them you are going to develop. Money is not the most important indicator, but it’s a good guide to start with.
capricorn,Don’t change things for the sake of it today because almost certainly you will have to change them back again when mind planet Mercury turns retrograde on Wednesday. Be happy with the status quo, at least for the time being. ,capricorn,Your head is full of good ideas and some of them may even be great but now you need to get your act together and decide which should be followed up and which should be forgotten. First question: what is likely to make you most money? ,capricorn,Don’t take anything at face value over the next 24 hours. As mind planet Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases the more others try to convince you that something is clearly right the more likely it is to be wrong. ,capricorn,No one expects you to be perfect, so why do you expect it of yourself? If you have made some kind of mistake then hold your hand up and admit it. In the greater scheme of things it’s really no big deal.
capricorn,No the ends do not justify the means and you need to remember that fact. The more someone tries to convince you that you can do something wrong because it will lead to something right the further the distance you need to put between you.
capricorn,If a friend tries to play on your feelings this weekend that’s a sure sign they want something from you. You may, of course, be happy to give it to them but insist they come clean about their motivations first. ,capricorn,You may be worried that you have spent too much in recent weeks but don’t go to extremes and deny yourself. It’s one thing to buy something just because it makes you happy but quite another because you really do need it. ,capricorn,Once again you are worrying about something that is not worth the hassle. If something about your cash flow situation is bothering you chances are it is mainly, if not entirely, in your mind. So don’t think, just act instinctively.
capricorn,The whole world could be against you now and it would not worry you in the slightest – your confidence is unshakable. Just be careful you don’t overdo it and create rivals where none need exist. Confidence is one thing, arrogance quite another.
capricorn,You may be tempted to cut corners and do less than your best on a task of some kind today but is that such a good idea? Chances are it will lead to mistakes and those mistakes will cost a lot to correct. Get it right the first time.
capricorn,The most important thing today, tomorrow and over the weekend is that you resist the urge to compare yourself to other people. Life is not a contest where you have to be number one, so set yourself targets based on your own true desires.
capricorn,Certain people may be making life tough for you for no apparent reason but that is no reason to feel sorry for yourself or start complaining that life is unfair. Of course it’s unfair, that’s part of the fun. Rise to the challenge and master it. ,capricorn,You would be wise not to take on any new duties over the next 48 hours. You would also be wise not to take your existing duties too seriously. There are more important things in life than worrying about everyday chores.
capricorn,Don’t try to show your feelings for someone by splashing a load of cash on them. Not only is it not what they expect of you but you could put yourself in serious financial difficulties. They already know you love them.
capricorn,Something unexpected will knock you out of your stride today and you will find it hard to get your rhythm back. Which may be frustrating but don’t make a big issue of it – just go off and do something different for a while. ,capricorn,If you get conflicting advice concerning business and money matters today you are advised to put off making decisions until later in the week. Don’t listen to those who say you must act now – they are thinking of themselves, not of you.
capricorn,Do not allow yourself to get dragged into a dispute between friends or work colleagues. Even if you get involved out of good intentions you are likely to make an enemy of one side or the other, so keep your distance.
capricorn,Someone will make you a rather tempting offer today but if you are smart you will demand a lot more. According to the planets they want you on board so much they can probably be persuaded to up their offer substantially. ,capricorn,If you go to extremes over the next 24 hours you are sure to provoke a strong reaction. Maybe that’s what you are hoping to do but is that wise? Try to find a more socially acceptable outlet for your ambition and aggression. ,capricorn,Others can be as miserable as they please this weekend but you intend to have a really good time. Travel and socialize and laugh often. Those around you won’t be miserable for long – how can they be when you’re so full of fun?,capricorn,Weigh your options carefully before taking action this week. It would appear that a rival or competitor has set up a trap hoping you will blunder into it, but you’re not so easily fooled. Maybe you should set a trap for them.
capricorn,You need to let someone know that you are under no obligation to do their bidding. This may come as a surprise to them as you have allowed them to get away with so much, but it’s time to draw a line in the sand. ,capricorn,You may find it hard to get a straight answer from a friend or work colleague today but don’t let it bother you. The fact is you don’t need their input, still less their permission, so stop trying to be so polite. ,capricorn,Something that has been tormenting you these past few weeks will no longer seem such a problem after today. You will also be delighted to discover that you are not as poor financially as you thought you were. ,capricorn,Pace yourself sensibly and don’t force yourself to do things simply because other people expect you to do them. If you don’t have the energy or the inclination to do a certain task then don’t do it. No one can make you.
capricorn,You seem to know just the right thing to say to get people on your side. Make that work in your favor today, especially when dealing with money matters. Your way with words could make you, and save you, a pile of cash.
capricorn,You may feel a bit hard done by, even that certain people are using you for their own ends, but don’t make an issue of it. In a matter of days their power over you will wane and you will be free to chart your own course again.
capricorn,You have become too predictable of late and need to break out of your rut and make your routines less habitual. Start by doing something completely out of character, something you have never done before (and may never do again). ,capricorn,It may seem as if you are powerless in the face of forces you don’t really understand but once the Sun changes signs in midweek you will find ways to start fighting back. Make sure you pick the right targets – not everyone is the enemy. ,capricorn,You can blame other people for what has gone wrong but wouldn’t it be more honest to look at your own performance first? You don’t usually pass the buck so easily, so why start now? Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even a Capricorn! ,capricorn,Aim to be on the move today because it is the people you meet along the way who will make things happen for you. Communications of all kinds will also go well, so let partners and colleagues know what you need.
capricorn,Someone you live or work with will tell you something you don’t want to hear today but deep down you know that it’s true. Swallow your pride and act on the information – it could save you a lot of trouble later on.
capricorn,Mars in the domestic sector of your chart is likely to spark family squabbles of one sort or another but they are really not that important. Also, with Venus working in your favor you can quite easily calm things down. Be the voice of reason.
capricorn,Try not to be too critical of other people today, even if their efforts are not up to your standards. Partners and loved ones need your support, as do the people you work alongside. Boost their confidence, don’t wreck it.
capricorn,Make sure no one is left in any doubt what it is you mean. Words are powerful and if you choose your words wisely over the next seven days there is no telling what you might accomplish. First though, know what it is you desire. ,capricorn,What a friend or relative tells you today may not be what you were hoping to hear but it is good advice and if you are smart you will listen and learn. If you are not so smart you could make a big mistake – and learn the hard way. ,capricorn,You are having doubts about something that only a short while ago you thought was a great idea. Be don’t give up on it yet, because a few days from now your doubts will be gone and it will be a great idea all over again.
capricorn,If you need to say something difficult, something that might upset a few people, say it now rather than later. The Sun in the communications area of your chart will help you find the words to convey your meaning without being too hurtful. ,capricorn,Make the most of your newfound freedom to get out into the world and explore. Do something you have not been able to do for quite some time today. You will enjoy it immensely, especially if others tell you it is still forbidden.
capricorn,Be extra careful when dealing with people in positions of authority today. It does not matter that you are in the right, what matters is that they have the power. Don’t make it easy for them to make life difficult for you.
capricorn,Be careful when dealing with employers and people in positions of authority this weekend because if you say or do something they consider disrespectful they are unlikely to be very forgiving. Don’t pick fights you cannot possibly win.
capricorn,Be nice to everyone, even people you don’t like very much. Someone who is a rival now could become a friend and ally by the end of the week. It seems you have a lot in common – and maybe a common enemy too. ,capricorn,You will discover something about a friend that makes you understand why they have been behaving so strangely of late. Keep what you find to yourself. It may be no big deal to you but obviously it is important to them. ,capricorn,Some kind of upheaval will take place today and because you like things to stay as they are you won’t be happy about it. However, this particular upheaval comes with an opportunity attached, so stay switched on. You could make some money.
capricorn,If you have something to say make sure you say it loud and clear. Don’t worry that by speaking your mind you might damage your career prospects – it’s a risk worth taking and could actually have the opposite effect. People will admire your integrity.
capricorn,You will find it hard to make up your mind as to what it is you should be doing today but that’s okay. The planets indicate there is no need to rush – in fact the longer you put off making a decision the better.
capricorn,You are in a hugely positive mood at the moment and that’s good because there is so much that needs to be done. But don’t try to do it all in one go because even if you succeed you will exhaust yourself and ruin your weekend.
capricorn,By all means go out and enjoy yourself this weekend. Others may say you are being irresponsible, that there are chores that need to be done, but even if they are right you can quite easily get them done another day. Only do what makes you smile.
capricorn,Someone you live or work with is in need of your help and you will go out of your way to assist them. But make sure they are not taking advantage of you for purely selfish reasons. You can sometimes be too sympathetic for your own good.
capricorn,You may feel out of touch with the spirit of the times but is that such a bad thing? Looking around at the world you might come to the conclusion that the times are not as good as they should be. So how can you make them better? ,capricorn,Follow your intuition over the next 24 hours, even if it leads you in a strange new direction. And remember: just because a lot of people are moving down one particular path does not mean it is the right path, at least not for you.
capricorn,There is no point getting involved in something you know you won’t enjoy, so be brave and let those who are trying to persuade you to get involved know that you are having none of it. Always be true to who and what you are.
capricorn,You are in one of your negative moods. You are convinced that the roof is going to fall in on you at any moment. So it will come as a nice surprise today when the roof stays where it is and something wonderful happens instead.
capricorn,Others may be impressed by your air of self-confidence but what they don’t know is that it’s a bit of an act, you don’t feel that confident at all. Having said which, Mercury’s change of signs today will give your self-belief a boost. ,capricorn,Something you have been struggling with mentally will resolve itself this weekend. Your mind will come up with the right explanation and you will kick yourself for not having thought of it sooner. Never mind, you know now and that’s what counts.
capricorn,There are so many things you want to say but for one reason or another cannot find the words. Don’t worry, the approaching solar eclipse will help you get your message across – in fact once you start talking you may not be able to stop! ,capricorn,Why do some people get hysterical over such minor matters? Why can’t everyone be calm and controlled like you? Whatever the reason it’s unlikely they are going to change, so make allowances and, where possible, stay out of their way. ,capricorn,If someone says something that annoys you today you must let them know you are not amused. If you let them get away with it once they will no doubt be tempted to bad mouth you again later on. Nip it in the bud.
capricorn,You may not be in the mood to compromise at the moment but the fact is you are going to have to, especially on the home front where loved ones can dig in their heels just as effectively as you. Meet them halfway.
capricorn,You can sense that something good is going to happen but there is no need to hurry it along. Venus, planet of harmony, in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus means the right opportunity will arrive at just the right time, so be patient.
capricorn,In the wider scheme of things there is no such thing as coincidence and if you feel yourself drawn towards a certain person it is because your fates are connected. Together you can find what apart you have searched for in vain. ,capricorn,Partners and loved ones seem to be giving you the silent treatment at the moment. Why? What have you done wrong? The only way you are going to find out is to ask them. Most likely it’s just a misunderstanding. You’ll laugh about it one day. ,capricorn,This is an excellent time for all kinds of communications, so get out into the world and mix with as wide a range of people as you can. Don’t stay at home waiting for others to contact you – reach out and make contact yourself. ,capricorn,You like to prove yourself but the planets warn you could find yourself up against a force that is too big for even you to tame over the next 24 hours. Don’t upset people in positions of authority – the results could be painful. ,capricorn,This is a good time to start something creative or artistic. It may take up a lot of your time and require a considerable input of emotional and physical energy but that’s okay – what you get back will more than balance what you put in.
capricorn,Venus in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus makes it much easier to express your feelings. Just be careful you don’t become infatuated with someone you have been too afraid to approach in the past. Your passion could cause problems. ,capricorn,Your confidence is improving and it won’t be long before your positive attitude brings positive results. Both in your personal life and at work people will sense your self-assurance and want to do things for you – and you must let them.
capricorn,The intensity of your emotions could catch you by surprise today, so promise yourself now that you will stay in control and not overreact. If you do go too far you may be a bit embarrassed later when you realize what was said and done.
capricorn,Someone who has helped you in the past won’t be able to help you this weekend, not because they don’t want to but because they have other things to deal with. In a way that’s good – it means you will have to learn to help yourself.
capricorn,You know that a friend needs help and you would like to offer your assistance but their body language says “keep your distance”. There is nothing you can do but to respect their unspoken wish. Maybe they enjoy suffering in silence. ,capricorn,Work hard early in the day because the afternoon and evening will bring social opportunities you won’t want to miss. And if you don’t get everything done? Leave it until later in the week. Don’t burden yourself with unnecessary deadlines. ,capricorn,Mars in Taurus over the next few weeks will make you energetic in the extreme. Make the most of it to finish a project that should have been completed a long time ago. This could be the last chance you get,capricorn,Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart makes all things possible, so forget about the things that went wrong and focus on the things that are going to go right. This is potentially a great time for you, so seize the initiative.
capricorn,The more others say you should be careful the more determined you will be to take some kind of risk. Are you right or are they right? Only time will tell but, one way or the other, you will have fun finding out.
capricorn,Don’t worry what others might think about what you are planning – if it feels right to you then nothing else matters. The approaching eclipse makes this a good time to rock the boat a bit. It’s unlikely to be you who falls out!,capricorn,You must be totally honest with people you work with this weekend, even if they have the power to make things difficult for you if you fall out. If you bend the truth now it will come back and bite you later in the month.
capricorn,You may take certain issues a bit too seriously over the next few days and arguments are likely, but it’s no big deal. In fact it could work in your favor in that you need to find something to let off steam about. Passion needs an outlet. ,capricorn,You will have to deal with some annoying people today but getting angry won’t make things any easier. Yes, of course, it’s a pain when others act slowly or stupidly but not everyone can be as switched on as you. Make allowances. ,capricorn,You are reading too many things into too many situations and it’s not healthy. Make it your aim today to think and analyze less and just go with the flow. It may not be your natural way but it is certainly the right way.
capricorn,Try not to let your emotions get the better of you today. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters. With Jupiter, planet of excess, moving through the wealth area of your chart it won’t be difficult to overreact.
capricorn,Try not to be too critical of other people today, because however well meaning your comments may be if they sound too negative they won’t go down well. Loved ones, especially, need your support, not your criticism, so be positive.
capricorn,You may want to help someone in need and you may know what is best for them but that does not mean you should force yourself on them. Some people prefer to suffer in silence than admit they need assistance. Respect their wishes.
capricorn,Try not to get uptight if you come across someone whose attitude you disapprove of. If they really offend you that much just stay out of their way, but if you get chatting you may be surprised to discover you have things in common.
capricorn,Pace yourself sensibly over the coming week and don’t force yourself to do anything simply because other people demand it of you. If you don’t have the desire to do a certain task then don’t do it – no one has the power to force you.
capricorn,Try not to attach too much importance to what you hear from a friend or work colleague today because there is every chance they don’t know what they are talking about. Don’t make important decisions based on dubious “facts”. ,capricorn,You can turn almost any situation to your advantage over the next 24 hours. Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart means you are intensely ambitious – and it makes you more passionate than usual. Try mixing business with pleasure!,capricorn,Don’t push yourself too hard or take on any new responsibilities over the next 24 hours – and don’t let other people talk you into doing things that are of no interest to you personally. It’s your life and you should be in control of it.
capricorn,Don’t let anyone tell you that certain things cannot be done. What seems difficult, maybe even impossible, at this moment in time will become much easier when the Sun changes signs on Monday. Life never stands still and neither should you.
capricorn,No matter what happens over the next 48 hours you must not lose your temper. It may be that you have to turn a blind eye to someone who is doing things you know to be wrong but peace of mind is your principal concern.
capricorn,Forget about details and focus on the big questions of life. If possible, find a like-minded soul with whom you can discuss the meaning of the universe. If not, find a quiet spot where you can think about it on your own for a while. ,capricorn,Don’t push yourself too hard as the new week begins. The Sun’s move into the most dynamic area of your chart will fill you with energy and enthusiasm but you need to plan a bit too. What is your number one aim? Start working towards it.
capricorn,Think big today, and for the rest of the week. The Sun in your fellow Earth sign of Taurus at this time of year makes all things possible, for you at least, so don’t limit yourself to petty ambitions. Go for gold.
capricorn,The Sun and Mars are all working in your favor at the moment, so decide what it is you most want to accomplish then go all out to make it happen. Affairs of the heart are also well starred. Tell that special someone how much you love them.
capricorn,Seize the initiative today and let everyone around you know that you intend to take what it is you desire rather than wait for others to give it to you. The Sun in Taurus makes all things possible, so there is no excuse for second best.
capricorn,Have confidence in yourself by all means but don’t think that merely by turning up everyone else will back down and make it easy for you to win. They won’t. Confidence is important, of course, but so is having a plan and so is staying power.
capricorn,You will clash with someone this weekend whose opinions you not only disagree with but actually detest and it could be a difficult situation for both of you. Sometimes in life you have to stand up and fight for what you believe in. ,capricorn,Anyone who gives you a hard time this week will soon wish they had been nice instead. You are in no mood to give warnings or second chances – the moment they overstep the mark there will be instant retribution. You’re scary when you’re like this! ,capricorn,If you take a risk of some kind over money today it may pay off, but even if it does you must not cast aside your usual cautious Capricorn nature. You of all people should know that it’s not about risk, it’s about hard work.
capricorn,You will make efforts above and beyond the call of duty over the next 24 hours. The Sun and Mars in the most dynamic area of your chart makes you feel like you can take on the world and win. And you know what? You can!,capricorn,The cosmic powers that be are very much on your side at the moment. What does that mean in practical terms? It means you can and you should do something memorable, something you will be remembered for in years to come.
capricorn,It is one thing to dream but quite another to turn dreams into reality, so start thinking now about how you can take practical steps to make your current dream come true. You’ve had the inspiration, now what’s needed is some perspiration.
capricorn,A task you have been putting off for ages will have to be dealt with over the next few days. The sooner you get started on it the sooner it will be done and then you can turn your attention to more enjoyable things. Get to it!,capricorn,The problem you will face over the next 48 hours is very similar to a problem you faced a little while ago, so stop worrying and think back to how you got through it before. The past cannot be changed but you can always learn from it. ,capricorn,Some people bring out the best in you and others bring out the worst but ultimately only you can decide how to deal with them and what emotions you allow to develop. You are not and never will be a victim, so don’t act like one. ,capricorn,The pace of life will be hectic over the next few days and the demands others make of you will be tough. Now that you know that you can plan ahead sensibly and be ready to say “no” when too much is expected of you. ,capricorn,Are you feeling lucky? Hopefully you are because your state of mind will very much dictate what you gain, or lose, today. If you believe that you deserve the best then you will get it – it’s your mind that creates your reality.
capricorn,This is generally a positive time for you but you still need to take care where your finances are concerned. Above all you should resist the temptation to spend money on luxuries and other things you know you cannot really afford. ,capricorn,Promise yourself here and now that no matter what happens today you won’t take it too seriously. Treat whatever occurs, be it “good” or be it “bad” as part of life’s little game. It’s your attitude that makes your world.
capricorn,Say what you have to say as plainly as possible, so there can be no misunderstandings. That is not, however, an excuse to be rude and antagonize colleagues and friends. Straight talking is an art but it does not have to be a martial art! ,capricorn,You may be tempted to give up on a project that seems to have hit a wall but if you do you will regret it later. Keep at it and keep telling yourself it will come right in the end. Since when do Capricorns give in so easily? ,capricorn,As Mars moves into your opposite sign over the next few days you must expect partners and colleagues and loved ones to be more assertive than they have been of late. Don’t let them push you around – stand up for yourself. ,capricorn,Something you do – or don’t do – will shock those who see you as the one person who can always be depended on, but maybe that’s the idea. Maybe you’ve had enough of possessing the shoulder everyone leans on, at least for a while. ,capricorn,You may not be the life and soul of the party at the moment but don’t let it worry you. The less time you spend talking and socializing the more time you will have to think – and you will come up with some remarkable ideas.
capricorn,You may be considering giving up on a project that appears to have run its course, but something will happen over the next few days that makes you think again. It could be there is a lot of mileage in it yet, so don’t give up so easily.
capricorn,The Sun remains in the most dynamic area of your chart for one more week, which means you still have time to start something new. Pay no attention to those who counsel caution – your creative passion must not be limited in any way.
capricorn,It does not matter that others say something cannot be done – if you want it enough you will find a way to get it. Stop worrying about where you have been and start looking ahead and planning where you are going to be.
capricorn,Set your sights high and don’t settle for second best, either in your career or in your personal life. You may have to push yourself a little harder than usual this weekend but that’s okay – you have got plenty of energy in reserve.
capricorn,No matter what you may have achieved in the past you will do something even better over the next few days. The people you meet on your travels will do just about anything for you, so ask yourself what it is you really want. ,capricorn,Most things will come easy to you this week but that does not mean you will sit back and not make much of an effort. On the contrary, today’s new moon means you are even more dynamic and decisive than usual, and that’s saying something. ,capricorn,Whatever you are working on now you must make a good job of it. If you try to get away with less than perfect work you will most likely have to go back and do it all again later on while your friends are having fun.
capricorn,Over the next few days you will need to get a bit more serious about your work and your wellbeing. Not that there is anything much to worry about but you do need to pace yourself better. You don’t have to move so fast.
capricorn,You may have to make some minor adjustments to your working routine over the next few days but that’s okay. The more you change now the less you will have to change later on, and what you do change will work out perfectly for you.
capricorn,If life seems too complicated of late it is most likely because you are making it too complicated. How do you make it simpler? Do less – a lot less. Cut back to essentials and don’t waste time or energy on complicated ideas or activities.
capricorn,You probably won’t believe what a loved one tells you over the next 48 hours but don’t make a big deal of it because if you call them a liar it will seriously sour the mood. Pretend you agree with every word they say. ,capricorn,If you need assistance then you must speak up. Yes, it would be nice if friends and relatives could read your mind and come to the rescue without being asked but it doesn’t happen like that. Would you really want them knowing your thoughts?,capricorn,Venus in the partnership area of your chart urges you to let loved ones know exactly how you feel about them – and yes, your feelings are warm and deep. Most likely they know already, of course, but it never hurts to spell it out.
capricorn,You seem to be under the impression that you can get away with anything. It may or may not be true but either way it’s not a wise attitude to take. Life is good and getting better by the moment – don’t take risks that could spoil it. ,capricorn,By all means explore today. By all means visit places you have never been before. Not only will it be a lot of fun but it will widen your outlook and make you realize just how fortunate you are compared to most people.
capricorn,You may have to do something you don’t particularly enjoy today but if you knuckle down and get on with it you should finish in good time. More importantly, of course, you must make a good job of it – then you won’t have to do it again.
capricorn,Certain habits may be hard to break but if you tackle them one at a time there is no reason why you should not be successful. Also, when getting rid of a bad habit it always helps if you have a good habit ready to take its place.
capricorn,Why are you trying so hard to prove yourself? Whatever the reason you need to learn to be comfortable with who you are and what you do. Then and only then will you get over the need to earn approval from other people. ,capricorn,It may seem as if you have enemies in all directions but you don’t. Yes, it’s possible that someone bears you ill feelings but it’s unlikely they are in a position to do anything about it, so don’t even think about it. A frown doesn’t suit you. ,capricorn,Doubts and fears you thought you had conquered will make a reappearance over the next few days but you must not let them take over your life. Most of what you are worrying about does not exist in the real world at all, just in your head. ,capricorn,There may be a dozen and one things that you are worrying about at the moment but none of them are important. Take a moment and look around you. Compared to most people your existence is charmed. There is simply no need for negativity.
capricorn,Because everyone else seems happy with what’s going on you may be reluctant to voice your disapproval, but chances are if you speak up today others will be encouraged to come clean about their doubts as well. You’re by no means alone. ,capricorn,If you find yourself under pressure today you will most likely have brought it on yourself. You have taken on too many duties and responsibilities in recent weeks and now you are starting to pay the price. Cut back on your workload. ,capricorn,It’s good news all round for money matters and business arrangements. The entry of Venus into the wealth area of your chart means you can expect some kind of windfall over the next few days. A joint project will pay off big time.
capricorn,There is no reason to keep looking over your shoulder. Even if you have done something wrong the planets will protect you from too big a comeback, so there is no call for paranoia, still less for saying sorry or making amends. ,capricorn,Something you have been anxious about will resolve itself during the early part of the week and you will be both surprised and relieved. Knowing you though you will quickly find something new to worry about. You’re a glutton for punishment.
capricorn,What you need to remember as the new week begins is that nothing stays the same forever. The next few days may be difficult but if you see the changes that are taking place as necessary, and potentially good, they will be easier to deal with. ,capricorn,Make sure partners and loved ones know how you feel, especially if you are the kind of Capricorn who keeps a poker face most of the time. Sometimes it can be hard even for those who know you best to divine your mood.  .
capricorn,You may have to work with someone you do not much like over the next 24 hours but if you are smart you will hide your feelings and get on with the job. Just because you don’t like them does not mean you can’t work with them.
capricorn,You need to face up to the fact that certain routines and methods have had their day and need to be replaced. Don’t wait any longer. If you leave it too long the chance will pass you by and you could be stuck in the past forever.
capricorn,Let partners and loved ones make the decisions today, especially if you are planning to be on the move. Almost certainly anything you suggest will be rejected, so let them come up with ideas – then you can decide whether or not you are interested.
capricorn,The planets warn you need to get organized because your time and energy are likely to be more limited than usual. Don’t take on any new jobs over the weekend – you need to get on top of your current workload first.
capricorn,You will need to make a special effort to get along with partners, loved ones and work colleagues over the next few days. The nicer you are to others now the more freedom you will have later to come and go as you please.
capricorn,Find ways to combine business and pleasure today. You are in a more fun-loving mood but there are still some serious things to be taken care of, especially on the work front. Aim to get the best of both worlds at the same time.
capricorn,Make sure you are paid the proper amount for whatever tasks you undertake today. You like to help people out but that does not mean they can take advantage and take it for granted that you will work for next to nothing.
capricorn,Decide what needs to be done, then get on and do it. While your rivals are wasting time arguing about this and that you will be out there in the real world making things happen. It’s actions that count, not words.
capricorn,You have covered a lot of ground in recent weeks and you will cover a lot more in the weeks and months to come. For best results though you need to stop being such a loner and join with those who share your interests.
capricorn,You need to put your affairs in order, both at home and at work, because in a matter of days you will be too busy with other people’s problems to worry much about your own. Routine matters must be dealt with now, not later.
capricorn,Don’t try to force others to follow your lead because over the next few weeks it is you who is going to be doing most of the following. You can still get your way in some things but you must be subtle about it. Persuade, don’t pressurize.
capricorn,The cracks in a relationship are getting too wide to ignore and come Wednesday, when Mars moves into your opposite sign, they will become a gaping chasm. Either you find a lasting solution now or you go your separate ways.
capricorn,You may have reason to be angry with what a friend or family member has said or done but you are advised not to make an issue of it. Today’s cosmic outlook will help you overlook their failings and remember they have a good side too. ,capricorn,You are in an optimistic mood at the moment but take care your positive outlook does not get the better of you and you start making promises you won’t be able to keep. The world knows what you can do, so you don’t have to exaggerate.
capricorn,Something out of the ordinary will happen today or tomorrow and to say you will be surprised is a massive understatement. Whatever it is and be it “good” or be it “bad”, keep your cool and find ways to make it work for you.
capricorn,You will have to get tough with someone who is getting emotional for no good reason. If you let them carry on as they are they will not only make a fool of themselves but could annoy people in positions of power. Make them see sense. ,capricorn,As Mercury moves through the work and health area of your chart you will find plenty of reasons to get up and get busy – not least that you fear your reputation will suffer if you don’t take a leading role. Don’t exhaust yourself though. ,capricorn,It may seem as if others are conspiring to stop you moving in a certain direction but are they really or are you yourself creating obstacles by projecting your fears on your environment? It may be your subconscious is trying to tell you something.
capricorn,You may be tempted to make changes over the next few days but because the moon is full in your sign on Thursday you will most likely change them back again at a later date, at no small cost. Chances are things are not nearly as bad as you seem to think they are.
capricorn,You may be more emotional than usual over the next few days and that could cause problems if it leads you to behave in ways that undermine your relationships. Friends and loved ones have your interests at heart, so listen to them.
capricorn,You won’t stand for any kind of nonsense today, either in your personal life or at work. You certainly won’t let others, be they friends or rivals, piggyback on your success. You worked hard to get what you’ve got – so keep it.
capricorn,You are in a generous mood at the moment, the kind of mood when you will do anything for anybody, whether or not they deserve it. Don’t worry if someone takes advantage of you – ultimately they will lose and you will gain.
capricorn,You may be tempted to avoid some kind of challenge but the planets warn if you do it will give your rivals the impression that you are easily intimidated, and that’s the last thing you want. Master your fear and tackle it head on.
capricorn,You like to get your own way and most of the time you do but with strong cosmic activity in your opposite sign at the moment you would be wise to let others win occasionally. Try not to create discord where none need exist.
capricorn,The more you try to force events to move in one direction today the more likely it is they will move in the opposite direction, so give up and go with the flow. Look on the bright side: the less you resist the more you will achieve.
capricorn,You may have to endure one or two setbacks today but don’t let them unsettle you because things will get better as the week moves on. Above all, don’t lose your temper with people whose support you are going to need.
capricorn,Don’t keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself today because others will know in an instant what you are trying to hide. Why you should want to hide anything is a bit of a mystery. What have you got to be embarrassed about?,capricorn,Don’t give away too much information about what you are doing today. The less others know about your plans the better, not least because one of your friends has a very big mouth and could tip off your rivals.
capricorn,You have so many great ideas but before you start working on any of them it might be wise to seek the opinions of people you know you can trust. The planets warn there may be something small but important that you have missed.
capricorn,The events of your life seem to be repeating themselves – the people and places may be different but the issues and emotions are the same. Which begs the question: have you learned from your previous mistakes? If you have, you have nothing to fear.
capricorn,Do something unexpected over the next few days, something that takes those around you by surprise. Not only will it make others look at you with new respect, it may even throw up an opportunity to make extra cash.
capricorn,Be on your guard if someone offers you something for nothing today. It could be their generosity is not all it seems and at some stage you will be expected to do something for them in return. Know what the deal is before you agree.
capricorn,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign means you will need assistance over the next few days, and you are more likely to get it if others think they owe you something. Make an effort for them and they will make an effort for you.
capricorn,The planets warn that if you let others see you are worried about something they will play on your fears. The Sun in your opposite sign may give your rivals the upper hand but you are under no obligation to make things easy for them.
capricorn,You will have to work hard to overcome some sort of challenge today but hard work is something you know all about. Anyone who thinks they are tough enough to take you on and win will soon be nursing their wounds!,capricorn,Your needs and desires have not been satisfied to any great extent in recent weeks but be of good cheer. In a matter of days you will get the chance to make up for lost time. Today though you should let others have their own way. ,capricorn,You are not as set in your ways as some might believe and this weekend you will surprise a few people by your willingness to take risks. They will, of course, be of the calculated kind but even that’s better than nothing!,capricorn,You will have to make an important decision around the time that the Sun and Mercury change signs together on Thursday. Will you get it right? Maybe, maybe not, but the important thing is that you are actually doing something at last. ,capricorn,If you honestly believe that a friend or colleague is making a poor job of something on purpose then by all means have a go at them. On the other hand, your standards can be very high, so maybe you are expecting too much of them. ,capricorn,You may be on a tight schedule at the moment but you still need to make time for people who depend on you for support and encouragement. What you do for them now they will do for you tenfold at some stage in the future. ,capricorn,There is a danger that you will ignore certain warning signals and put yourself in a position where you are easily taken advantage of. You may want to believe that someone is telling you the truth but deep down you know they are not.
capricorn,Mercury’s move into one of the more inward-looking areas of your chart today means you will find yourself thinking more deeply about who you are and what you should be doing with your life. The answers you reach may surprise you. ,capricorn,Listen carefully to what a friend has to tell you this weekend because they can see the bigger picture while you can see only isolated bits of it. You may be smart but others can be smart too. Learn from what they already know. ,capricorn,Listen carefully to what a friend has to tell you this weekend because they can see the bigger picture while you can see only isolated bits of it. You may be smart but others can be smart too. Learn from what they already know.
capricorn,The planets suggest that you will clash with someone who does not share your outlook on life. But you don’t have to make a fight of it – you can always turn your back and walk away. It’s not cowardice, it’s the sensible option.
capricorn,This is no time for regret or remorse. You cannot change what has already happened, you can only learn from it and make sure that next time you do a better job. Always look forward, never look back – it’s simply not worth it.
capricorn,If your instincts tell you that you are on the right track then you must trust them and act on them. That, in a nutshell, is the message of the stars for you now and if you follow it the next few days will be a lot of fun.
capricorn,Don’t let others know that you are desperate about something because it puts you at a disadvantage. Whether you are negotiating a business deal or applying for a new job you are more likely to get what you want if you play it cool. ,capricorn,If you help a friend or work colleague today they will repay the favor later on when it is you who is having trouble getting past some kind of obstacle. In a nutshell: be kind to others and they will more likely be kind to you.
capricorn,What happens today will shock you out of your complacency and remind you, once again, that you must never take anything for granted. You may have to tighten your belt a bit financially but in the long-term you will be better off for it.
capricorn,Go where your instincts take you and don’t worry what others might say about it. The planets indicate you won’t be afraid to take a few risks and explore further afield than usual. Travel for pleasure and romance is especially well starred.
capricorn,Your thoughts may be far away at the moment but you won’t be allowed to neglect your duties for long. Employers and other important people will let you know in no uncertain terms if they think you are not pulling your weight.
capricorn,It is important that you act for the right reasons now, because if you act purely for profit or pleasure you will suffer for it later in the week. Remember that wise old saying: to get some you often have to give some too. ,capricorn,Something that has been worrying you for ages will finally be resolved today and the sense of relief you feel will last throughout the week. While you feel this good why not go out and do something different, something extravagantly creative?,capricorn,If you get the chance to socialize today you are strongly advised to forget about work and have fun with your friends. Later in the month you will become a lot more reserved, so get the most from your social life now.
capricorn,Listen to what friends and relatives tell you today, because if you follow their advice it will save you wasting time and effort on things of no importance. Why learn from your own mistakes when you can learn from other people?,capricorn,According to the planets you have reached a point of no return, a point where you cannot go back and cannot go sideways – you have no choice now but to push ahead into the unknown. Where is your sense of adventure? It could be fun!,capricorn,What happens this weekend may, to begin with, make you afraid of more changes taking place in your life, but it won’t be long before you realize that it is for the best. Confront what is worrying you head on. It’s not as bad as you think.
capricorn,You may be tempted to step in and solve a loved one’s problems for them but is that really the right thing to do? Maybe they have a lesson to learn and maybe they will learn best if they are allowed to make their own mistakes.
capricorn,Actions always speak louder than words, so do what has to be done and don’t worry that others might not understand your reasons. The best way to make an impression is to lead by example – and no one leads better than you.
capricorn,The more reserved you have been in recent weeks the more likely it is you will give in to wild abandon today and over the rest of the week. Don’t worry too much if you make a spectacle of yourself. Others will cheer you, not jeer you.
capricorn,Get on the move. Get out into the world and explore. If you have shut yourself away in recent weeks you must now go right the other way and let everyone know that you still exist – some people may have forgotten! ,capricorn,Be cautious when doing business with people you don’t know and therefore cannot completely trust. Today’s rather deceptive Mercury-Neptune link warns that someone who seems honest may be trying to trick you. Don’t you dare fall for it.
capricorn,There may be no end of interesting things going on in the world but you must block each and every one of them from your mind today and focus on the one thing that means something to you. Everything else is a distraction.
capricorn,You don’t like it much when you are the only one who does not know what is going on and the planets indicate you are desperate to get in on the gossip. Be careful though. It could be embarrassing if you find the gossip is about you!,capricorn,Even if you are the kind of Capricorn who likes to stay close to home you will be hugely adventurous this week. Faraway places will intrigue you and you will find yourself gazing at the horizon and wondering what lies beyond. Time for a vacation.
capricorn,So many things are changing at the moment but in the long-term the results will be to your liking. A week or so from now you will have a much more positive view of what is going on. Until then, take life on trust.
capricorn,If you cut corners today you will have to pay for it in some way. With luck planet Jupiter firmly on your side at the moment you may think you can get away with anything but don’t be so sure. Play safe and play by the rules.
capricorn,Be wary of people who flatter you for no good reason. According to the planets there is a lot of intrigue going on at the moment, a lot of planning and plotting behind the scenes. Have nothing to do with it — simply refuse to get involved.
capricorn,You need to make up your mind and choose between equally appealing alternatives. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you can have it both ways because most likely you will end up with nothing. If in doubt, stick with what feels safest. ,capricorn,You have some pretty remarkable ideas buzzing around inside that big head of yours but they are not the sort of ideas that you should be sharing with people in positions of power. They may fear, rightly, that you are aiming to outshine them.
capricorn,You cannot be bothered to get annoyed about little things. Even if certain people act outrageously you will keep your thoughts to yourself so you don’t risk starting a feud. Just don’t give others the impression they can do as they please.
capricorn,Don’t withhold your affections from someone who has offended you. If you do you will regret it later in the week. You may only be playing hard to get but they will take it seriously and it could be a long time before your relationship recovers.
capricorn,There are certain people you would be wise to avoid over the next few days. You know who they are and you know what is likely to happen if your paths should cross, so plan your route carefully and make sure you don’t meet! ,capricorn,There will be plenty in the way of rumor today but precious little in the way of hard facts, so don’t jump to conclusions. When even those in positions of authority have no idea what is going on there is not much point making plans.
capricorn,You cannot go wrong today. With the Sun and Jupiter linked in your fellow Earth sign of Virgo you will have the world eating out of your hand. You don’t even need to be wary of people in positions of authority – they love you too! ,capricorn,You must do the right thing at the right time, especially on the work front. The planets warn that if you act too fast or, worse, too slow you will open yourself up to criticism from rivals and others who don’t want to see you succeed. ,capricorn,You are advised not to act on what you hear today, no matter how tempting it may be. The planets warn that the information you get, even if it comes from a trusted source, is not reliable, so hold back and wait to see how things develop.
capricorn,You may be desperate to make a start on something that you have been planning for ages but you are advised to give it a few more days before you begin. If you start in a mad rush this weekend you may overlook some small but important detail.
capricorn,You want to be friends with everyone but, sadly, not everyone wants to be friends with you. Don’t take it personally because you have not done anything wrong. On the contrary, it could be that others think they are unworthy of your friendship.
capricorn,The planets warn this is not a good time to make major moves, especially where money matters are concerned. It may seem as if you are on a sure-fire winner but looks can be deceptive. Don’t let others get rich at your expense. ,capricorn,All the hard work you have put in over recent weeks will pay off this week and quite naturally you will be delighted. Just be careful that, in the warm glow of success, you don’t agree to take on extra duties and responsibilities – you don’t need them.
capricorn,You seem to be worried that something of value is being taken away from you but ask yourself: how many times in the past have your worries proved to be unfounded? So what are the chances of this being any different? Stop worrying and start living.
capricorn,You may feel sorry for people who are down on their luck in the world but don’t start thinking that you are to blame. The best way to do your bit for others is to take care of those you are closest to. Charity begins at home.
capricorn,It might be unwise to speak your mind today, even if you are convinced that you are in the right and someone else is in the wrong. You are going to have to work closely with this person in the future, so think before you speak.
capricorn,With the Sun linked to Pluto in your sign this weekend your luck is well and truly in. Be careful what you ask for though because you will get it in quantities that might take you by surprise. Can you handle so much good fortune?,capricorn,If you have a secret you don’t want others to know about then you will need to guard your tongue over the next few days. If you say the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time they will draw the right conclusions – to your embarrassment! ,capricorn,Make sure you use your time and energy wisely over the next few days – don’t waste your resources on things and people that do not matter. Also, when traveling and socializing try to realize that not everyone thinks or acts as fast as you.
capricorn,The changes you are working on may not be easy but you must stick with them because they will make your life better in so many ways. The only things you are liable to lose are things you no longer need, so let them go. ,capricorn,Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes this an important time for deals and negotiations. Try to strike the right balance between cooperation and forcefulness. That way you will get things done and get more money in your bank account. ,capricorn,You must be free to make your own decisions and you must be free to come and go as you please, and anyone who tries to limit you in any way today must be told in no uncertain terms to mind their own business – or else!,capricorn,Make time to plan for the future today and over the weekend. The more you look ahead the more likely it is you will get lucky between now and the end of the year. You will soon get a chance to move up in the world.
capricorn,If you are looking to offload a task or project you can no longer be bothered with then now is the time to speak up and let colleagues know that your interest has gone. You have done plenty for them, now they can do more for themselves.
capricorn,There is no need for doubt and there is no need for false modesty – you’re the best and you know it. Cosmic activity in your fellow Earth sign of Virgo means there is nothing you cannot do, so do it and do it brilliantly.
capricorn,Why are you worrying for no good reason? The planets indicate that nothing will happen without your agreement and your say-so, so lighten up and try not to be so defensive about life. If it’s not fun then you’re not doing it right.
capricorn,Jupiter in the wealth area of your chart puts you in a strong position where anything of a financial nature is concerned. If a deal of some sort has to be made you should be the one calling the shots – and taking the lion’s share of the profits. ,capricorn,Open your eyes to new possibilities – then take advantage of them. Too often in the past you have been content to let life come to you, but now you must push yourself forward at every opportunity. Success comes to those who dare.
capricorn,You may be having a great deal of fun but have you considered the consequences which could arise from some of your more impulsive actions? Take time out today to think about what you are doing and why. Tone down your act a bit.
capricorn,Don’t waste your time trying to get other people to think and act like you – it’s not going to happen. You demand the right to be different so you should allow them to be different too – variety is what makes the world such an interesting place.
capricorn,Nothing can be allowed to restrict your movements or stop you from exploring the world around you. Look for meaning in everything you see, hear and do over the next two or three days. You may find more than you expected.
capricorn,Over the coming week you will find that your responsibilities get a bit heavier as loved ones come to rely on you more and employers and other important people add to your workload. Don’t worry – you will breeze through it all with ease. ,capricorn,Cosmic activity in and around the career area of your chart over the next few days will bring out your ambitious side – which is rarely far below the surface anyway. Don’t focus on what your rivals are doing – it’s what you do next that matters.
capricorn,If you want to get on in the world, to make your mark in some way, now is the time to get serious about it. Your professional reputation is sure to rise but you must be prepared to step into the spotlight. Don’t hide yourself away. ,capricorn,The Sun in Libra at this time of the year can help you reach your rightful place in the world which is, of course, at the very top. Give some thought over the next 24 hours as to what you want to accomplish career-wise – then make it happen.
capricorn,You will react badly to anyone who tries to tell you what to do, even if they have every right to point out your failings or point out the way. When dealing with employers and other authority figures try not to be quite so aggressive.
capricorn,Something will have to give over the next few days and most likely it will be something to do with your work. No matter how unsettling it may be, you will be okay if you remember that all change is ultimately good change.
capricorn,Settle for what is on offer during the early part of the week, even if it does not come up to your expectations. The planets warn that if you hold out for more you might actually get less, so be sensible and take what is on the table. ,capricorn,Good news is coming your way, but is it good news you can trust? Today’s lunar eclipse warns that what sounds like good news could have a hidden catch. Usually you are skilled at spotting tricksters but today it won’t be so easy, so be careful!,capricorn,You are not as set in your ways as some people believe and over the next 24 hours you will say things and do things that take the doubters by surprise. You will make a big impression on employers and other important people.
capricorn,Don’t pussyfoot around and try to pretend that things are better than they really are. You have serious issues to deal with and the only way to be successful is to be brutally realistic, both with yourself and with other people. ,capricorn,Don’t let rivals undermine your confidence today, especially on the work front where a setback has already put a dent in your morale. You may be on the down side of the curve at the moment but you will soon be moving up again.
capricorn,The planets indicate that you will find the courage to make the kind of difficult decision that most people would prefer not to think about. Keep telling yourself that change is not something to be avoided but something to be welcomed.
capricorn,There will be new challenges and new opportunities over the next few days. Someone in a position of authority has been watching you closely and believes you are ready to move up to bigger and better things. It’s important that you believe it too.
capricorn,Don’t worry about the little things over the next few days because it is the big things you should be focusing on now. Both in your private life and in the world at large you need to take a more active role. Capricorns were born to lead.
capricorn,You may be hungry for success but you must not cut corners or take liberties. Make sure your ambition has strong foundations and make sure there are no skeletons in your closet that your enemies can easily uncover. Bury them deep!,capricorn,Be on your guard if someone promises you something for nothing today. The planets warn that their generosity is not all it seems and at some stage you will be expected to do something for them in return – and it could be a very costly something. ,capricorn,You will get the chance to prove yourself and move up in the world very soon but you need to convince yourself that you are worthy of success. Don’t avoid challenging situations simply because you fear you are not up to the task. Believe in yourself. ,capricorn,Something that never interested you before will grab your attention today and you will spend every spare moment trying to understand it. Others may think you have taken leave of your senses but they can’t see the possibilities that you can. ,capricorn,The planets warn that certain people will try to bully you into abandoning opinions you genuinely believe in. Don’t let it happen. It does not matter if the whole world seems to disagree with you – you are right and they are wrong. Hold firm. ,capricorn,You like to be helpful and you don’t mind putting yourself out for a friend, but the planets warn if you do just one little thing for someone this weekend you could end up doing everything for them for weeks to come. Learn to say “no”.
capricorn,No matter how wedded to certain beliefs you may be you will realize this week that there are other ways of looking at life. You will also become aware that there are other ways of doing things, especially on the work front. ,capricorn,You won’t lack for opportunities to make your mark over the next few days but don’t fall into the trap of trying to take advantage of each and every one of them. Identify your priorities and focus on them to the exclusion of everything else.
capricorn,You have no time for trivial ambitions and still less time for trivial people and what happens today and tomorrow will make it clear to everyone that you are a serious player. Throw off that Capricorn caution and do something amazing. ,capricorn,Do whatever it takes to get along with people you work and do business with. That does not mean you must do everything they say just to make them feel good, but at least treat them as equals – even if they are not. ,capricorn,Your powers of persuasion are such that you can get just about anyone to agree to just about anything. Whether you use this power for good or bad remains to be seen but use it you must or you will regret what might have been.
capricorn,Keep your plans to yourself today, especially if they are the sort of plans that your rivals would love to disrupt. If you let slip even a hint of what you are up to those who wish you ill will find ways to make things tough.
capricorn,The last few weeks have not been easy but they toughened you up, and what happens this week will toughen you up some more. Then you won’t be scared to take advantage of an opportunity that comes your way towards the end of the week. ,capricorn,What goes right over the next few days will more than outweigh in value what goes wrong. Best of all you will recognize instinctively if a gamble is worth taking – you seem to have a knack for knowing who the winners will be.
capricorn,You may find it difficult to get along with certain people today, especially people you work with. However, you would be wise to make the effort because there could be financial repercussions if they feel you are being unfriendly for no good reason.
capricorn,If you are going to disagree with someone make sure you stick to the facts, because if you exaggerate in any way they will make it their business to make you look stupid. If the facts are not strong enough to back up your case, then keep quiet. ,capricorn,Are you doing something useful with your life? Does your existence make a difference? However you answer those questions you will get the chance to do a good deed over the next 48 hours. Do it in league with like-minded people. ,capricorn,You will go all out for glory over the next few days. You won’t care if you annoy certain people – in fact you will take it as a sign that you are doing the right thing. You are not going to change your ways just to please them. ,capricorn,You may be tempted to turn your back and walk away from a responsibility of some sort but deep down you know that’s the wrong thing to do. However difficult your duties may be you can and you must see them through to the end. ,capricorn,Your creative juices will be flowing this week but don’t expect others to be very responsive to your ideas. But who says you need their acceptance or approval? If you believe in what you are doing then get on with it regardless.
capricorn,You may not be able to do much for yourself as the new week begins but you can certainly help a friend or colleague overcome a problem of some kind. In doing so you may even discover why you have been stuck in the doldrums for so long. ,capricorn,Today’s events will open your eyes to new possibilities and you will be amazed how limited you have allowed your horizons to be in recent weeks. Get involved in projects that require you to work as part of a team – a winning team, of course! ,capricorn,You don’t have to go along with what those around you want to do. You have a mind of your own and if you are smart you will use it today. If you follow the crowd you could end up some place you did not want to go. ,capricorn,Someone you meet on your travels today, tomorrow or over the weekend could be very important to you career-wise over the months and years to come. Once you have made contact don’t leave it at that – make sure you develop a friendship.
capricorn,You are in no mood to let others dictate to you what you can and cannot believe, and that’s good, but remember that it works both ways: others are entitled to their opinions too. Say what you have to say, then do some listening as well.
capricorn,You are, of course, entitled to disagree with a colleague’s opinions but the planets warn you should keep your doubts to yourself for the time being. If what they say really annoys you find a reason to stay out of their way. ,capricorn,Find out what family and friends think about your latest plan before pushing ahead with it. It’s rarely a bad idea to ask others for their opinions and, on this occasion, they may even point out something important that you have overlooked. ,capricorn,Even friends and family members will be touchy as the new week begins, but now that you know that you won’t overreact. Fortunately, Capricorn is such a self-controlled sign that it’s unlikely you will go to extremes (though not impossible).
capricorn,As from today you will find it easier to understand why certain people think and act the way they do. It takes all sorts to make a world and you have no more right to demand that they be different than they have to demand it of you.
capricorn,While others are running around in a panic today you will be calmly assessing the situation and deciding what needs to be done. Whether or not it is the right decision is not really important: what matters is that you keep your head.
capricorn,Tread carefully today when talking to loved ones and relatives. If they get the impression, rightly or wrongly, that you are trying to tell them what to do they will react in a forceful way. Only give advice if it is asked for.
capricorn,Not everyone can be as confident and adventurous as you, so make allowances for those who don’t want to follow your lead. Actually, a little caution might be no bad thing as the planets warn this is not a day to take too many risks.
capricorn,You may be the center of attention this weekend but don’t take what others say about you to heart because their motives are likely to be less than pure. It’s good to be popular, of course, but self-respect is what really matters. ,capricorn,You don’t seem to be much in the mood for work and that’s good because you will achieve more if you slow down and give your batteries a chance to recharge. Do something creative but relaxing between now and Wednesday’s new moon.
capricorn,You will find yourself under a lot of pressure as the new week begins and at some stage you are going to have to stand up for yourself and let certain people know that you will not be taken advantage of. Don’t just say it – mean it.
capricorn,The more certain people say you should trust them today the more you should be on your guard. It is unlikely they are trying to deliberately mislead you but the planets warn that they themselves may have been misled. Be careful.
capricorn,This is a great time for friendships, social events and group activities. Get out into the world and make sure you are seen. And remember: what you do alone may be important but what you do with others can change the world. ,capricorn,There are times when you have to roll up your sleeves and get involved and this is one of them. Mars moving into the career area of your chart means you will get the chance to impress employers and other important people. Don’t waste it.
capricorn,Try to spend less time thinking about what might go wrong in your life and more time enjoying all the things that are still going right. Something will happen over the next few days that makes you realize just how lucky you really are. ,capricorn,You seem to be more concerned with the past than you are with the present and that’s rarely a good sign. Stop focusing on the things you missed out on and start noticing all the good things that are now coming your way.
capricorn,Don’t worry if you find it difficult to say what you really mean this week because the planets are aligned in such a way that your ability to express yourself clearly is restricted. Maybe you should take it as a hint to say less and think more.
capricorn,You won’t be able to rely on other people for advice or assistance over the next two or three days, so you will just have to delve into your reserves of courage and handle whatever life throws at you in your own way. You can do it if you try. ,capricorn,It may seem as if certain things are beyond your control, and maybe they are, but there is no need to get depressed about it. Life moves in cycles and if you are on a downward curve now you will be on an upward curve very soon. ,capricorn,It would be wise to keep certain thoughts and opinions to yourself, especially if they are of the sort that some people might find challenging. If you cannot say something that everyone can agree with it might be best not to say anything at all.
capricorn,Try not to take anything too seriously today. There is no point getting angry with life because you are dealing with forces that are too big to control or to change. Accept your current situation for what it is and go with the flow. ,capricorn,There may be times today when you get a bit suspicious and wonder why everyone is being so nice to you but don’t let your doubts hold you back. The fact is you are the kind of person who everyone likes and everyone wants to help.
capricorn,The Sun’s change of signs this weekend could undermine your confidence a bit but maybe that’s not such a bad thing. You need to slow down a little and take stock of your life, so anything that makes you think rather than act is to be welcomed.
capricorn,There will be times over the next few days when you want to be left alone with your thoughts. Make sure those you live and work with know that you require your own space. If they are not prepared to give it to you then get up and go elsewhere.
capricorn,You are where you are and you have no choice but to make the most of it, so put memories and regrets behind you and make the best of what you have got. You’re a Capricorn, you’re supposed to be courageous and confident.
capricorn,The more you have been frustrated in the past the more you will enjoy yourself now. By all means appreciate your moment in the spotlight but don’t make too big a deal of it. Modesty is always attractive – and less likely to make you a target! ,capricorn,You may be suspicious by nature but don’t let that stop you from doing what you want to be doing. Despite what your mind might be telling you no one is out to get you and you won’t lose out if you take the occasional risk. ,capricorn,You are under no illusions about what needs to be done. You are also smart enough to realize there are no shortcuts, that whatever you are working on demands your full and undivided attention and your very best efforts. Go for it Capricorn!,capricorn,There have been times of late when you seemed to lose direction but today your target is crystal clear: you know exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it. Make sure you don’t lose sight of your aims and ambitions so easily again. ,capricorn,Everything will fall into place over the next few days, so stop worrying about whether or not you are doing the right thing and prepare yourself for success. The breakthrough you have been dreaming of won’t be long in coming. Are you ready for it? ,capricorn,Good news of some kind is likely to come your way around the middle part of the week – in fact it may be better than good, it may be great. Don’t let anyone tell you that it is undeserved, because no one deserves it more than you.
capricorn,You know what you like and what you dislike but as from today you will take a more relaxed attitude toward people who think, feel or act in ways you do not always agree with. It takes all sorts to make the world go round. ,capricorn,You may look calm on the outside but on the inside your emotions are all over the place. Don’t keep your feelings bottled up. Sooner or later there will be an explosion and the longer you keep a lid on things the bigger that explosion will be. ,capricorn,Steer clear of people who rub you up the wrong way today. Some individuals are so full of their own importance that they think they can do or say anything and get away with it, but you know better. They will pay for their arrogance one day. ,capricorn,Do something that makes you feel alive. It does not matter if it is unproductive – you don’t have to be on the make every minute of every day. No one can accuse you of not working hard, so by all means play hard for a while. ,capricorn,You may not be the sort to make changes once you have made up your mind about something but the planets warn you may have no choice in the matter today. You are not in control of events ­ events are in control of you ­ so act accordingly.
capricorn,You seem to believe that others are out to get you, but in reality you have let your imagination run riot and now a few negative and wholly unnecessary ideas have taken hold. Remind yourself this weekend just how lucky, loved and admired you are.
capricorn,There is nothing you can do about what other people say about you but you can control the way you react to their words. Pretend that you really don’t care. Pretend that you don’t even hear them. It will annoy them more than if you get angry. ,capricorn,You can afford to be generous as the new week begins, especially when dealing with people who have not been as fortunate as you. Remember too that in the greater scheme of things everyone has a role to play – so try not to judge others too harshly.
capricorn,Employers and other important people seem to be rather demanding at the moment and what annoys you most is that they change their minds every two minutes or so. Don’t get angry because that will just make matters worse. You must stay calm. ,capricorn,Make it your business to make other people feel good about themselves. Not only will it cheer them up but it will cheer you up as well. The more you get out and about and mix with strangers the more alive you will feel today. ,capricorn,The doubts and fears of the past few weeks will fade away today as Mercury moves into your sign. The things you have been most anxious about will turn out to be the things you had least to fear. You will be back to your best in no time. ,capricorn,You may be tempted to give up on something today but the planets warn if you stop now you will regret it later in the month when the Sun moves into your birth sign. Keep going a bit longer. You are on the brink of a stunning breakthrough.
capricorn,You want to be friends with everyone, even with people who may not want to be friends with you. You see the good in each and every person and will make it your business to bring that good to the fore. You’ll need patience though, and lots of it. ,capricorn,You know what you want to change in your life, so what are you waiting for? Of course, if you really want to transform your existence then you will need to join forces with like-minded people. There is both safety and power in numbers.
capricorn,There is something that is bothering you and your rivals and enemies are beginning to pick up on the scent of your fear. There is really no need to worry about whether you are moving in the right direction because, ultimately, all roads lead to the same destination.
capricorn,If you do a good deed for someone today you will be rewarded for it at some stage in the future. Of course, you would do it anyway even if you knew you would get nothing out of it, because that’s the kind of big-hearted person you are! ,capricorn,Try to keep your more outrageous thoughts to yourself today because it’s unlikely that other people will understand them, still less appreciate them. Make allowances for those whose vision does not stretch as wide or as deep as your own – that’s just about everyone. ,capricorn,You may find it hard to get started today but once you do you will amaze everyone by how quickly you get through your workload. If you start early enough in the day then the evening will most likely be free for more enjoyable activities. ,capricorn,Recent weeks have been far from easy and there will be more challenges to deal with over the next few days. However, come next Tuesday, when the Sun moves into your sign, things will start to get better in a big way. It really is all good.
capricorn,Forget about trying to impress employers and other authority figures with words and do something that makes them sit up and take notice. This is no time to hold back – get out there and show the world what you are capable of.
capricorn,The Sun enters your birth sign on Tuesday and a new solar cycle begins. What you do over the next few days will to a large extent determine what kind of year you are going to enjoy, so be positive and focus on good things only.
capricorn,Stop telling yourself that you don’t have the talent to compete with certain people. It’s just an excuse to avoid making an effort. Not only do you have the talent but deep down you have the ambition too, so start digging and find it. ,capricorn,If you focus all your energy in a single direction over the next few weeks you will achieve something truly amazing. There can be no more doubts and no more wondering if you are making the right moves. Choose a path and stick to it. ,capricorn,Let your hair down and let others see you are not at all the conservative Capricorn they think you are. Don’t worry if you shock certain people – that’s good. The way to get noticed nowadays is to act just a little bit outrageous.
capricorn,Everything that needs to happen will happen when the time is right, so stop worrying. The approaching full moon means that others will be rushing here, there and everywhere in an effort to get on top of things, but you don’t have to do likewise.
capricorn,Even the most talented of Capricorns needs a helping hand once in a while, and your once in a while is today. Assistance will come if you ask for it but not if you just sit there looking helpless. Speak up. Let others know you are hurting.
capricorn,If something you value is taken away from you over the next 48 hours don’t get upset about it. In a matter of days you will have forgotten your loss as new and more interesting playthings come into your life. Change is good for you.
capricorn,By all means make a big effort but make sure that what you do you do primarily for yourself. Because they know you are so reliable colleagues and employers may try to shift some of their workload on to your plate. Don’t let them!,capricorn,Make an effort to get your message across over the next few days, because once Mercury, planet of communication, leaves your birth sign next weekend that won’t be so easy to do. Say what you have to say and have done with it.
capricorn,With both Mercury and Pluto moving through your sign you have no fear about expressing yourself. However, you might like to think twice before saying anything that could be seen as rude or derogatory today. Others may choose not to laugh it off. ,capricorn,Is someone bent on causing you harm? Or is it just your imagination working overtime again? Most likely it’s the latter, so stop thinking that the world and its dog is out to get you and start living your life free from fear. ,capricorn,This is going to be an extremely busy new year for you, so pace yourself and don’t overindulge . . . too much. You will get a lot done over the next few days but wellbeing problems are a possibility if you take on too much. ,capricorn,There are times when you must speak up and say your piece regardless of the effect it might have on other people, and such a time is now. The truth should never be suppressed and anyone who tells you otherwise is not to be trusted.
capricorn,You need to be honest with yourself about why a relationship is not working out the way you hoped it would. It’s not all your fault but some of the decisions you made in haste are now being repented at your leisure. Learn from your mistakes. ,capricorn,If a friend or family member is in need of a helping hand you should make it your business to reach out to them. Also, involve yourself more in group and team activities this week. Your leadership talents will be much in demand. ,capricorn,Every word a certain individual says seems to rub you up the wrong way. Either stay away from them or, if that is not possible, let them know that they need to keep silent, at least when you are around. The time for pleasantries is over.
capricorn,This should be one of the most enjoyable times of the year for you and the only thing that can spoil it is self-doubt. Ignore that nagging voice in the back of your head says that you are out of your league. You’re in a league of your own!,capricorn,Stand back from yourself and work out why you think and act in certain ways. Once you realize that so much of what you do is done out of habit it will be easier to change things. There is always something new you can learn about yourself. ,capricorn,Like it or not you will have to admit that no matter how much you might want to fit into a certain environment it was never meant to be. Today’s Sun-Uranus link indicates it is time to bring to an end something you should never have started. ,capricorn,You may be tough but you are not invincible and you need to keep that fact in mind today and over the weekend. With Jupiter, planet of luck, turning retrograde you may find that your path through life is not quite as easy as it has been of late.
capricorn,You will want to be left alone this weekend, so find ways to let people know that you are not in the mood to socialize. If you deal with your thoughts and feelings now you will be the life and soul of the party again very soon. ,capricorn,You have so much energy and enthusiasm at the moment but you need to remind yourself that what excites you may not be what excites other people. Don’t take it personally if someone tells you they don’t want to play the same game.
capricorn,Ignore those who say you have been lucky and don’t deserve it because they are wrong. They are just jealous that they have to work so hard while everything seems to come easy to you. Yes, life can be unfair at times, but that’s how it is.
capricorn,You may be inclined to rely on your intuition today but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. Stick to the facts and, where relationships are concerned, err on the side of caution. That applies to your family life and your work as well. ,capricorn,Whatever you want most out of life you will find a way to get. You can sense that the cosmic omens are all on your side at the moment and because of that you won’t allow anyone to stand in your way. Look out world, Capricorn is coming through! ,capricorn,If your sixth sense tells you to stop what you are doing and check the details again you would be wise not to ignore it. Mercury in your sign heightens your perception but may also distort things a little, so err on the side of caution.
capricorn,Don’t wait for approval, just get on and do what has to be done and worry about the consequences later. When all is said and done it is results that count, so don’t worry if your attitude upsets other people – they’ll come round in the end.
capricorn,You will want to get straight to the point this weekend. Others may be happy to beat about the bush but you don’t have the patience for playing games: not only will you see the truth clearly but you’ll make sure everyone else sees it too.
capricorn,Even if you are the kind of Capricorn who likes to stay in control of your emotions you won’t be able to disguise your feelings over the next few days. If you are upset about something, let others know. Likewise, if you are happy, let them know too. ,capricorn,You won’t be able to hide or disguise your feelings much longer, and nor should you want to. What happens over the coming week will make it easy for you to let certain people know what you really think of them – not a lot it seems!,capricorn,The planets indicate most strongly that it is time to get your act together. Over the past few weeks you’ve had a lot of ideas and started many new projects, but if you want to be successful you must focus your energies in a single direction.
capricorn,The Sun moves out of your sign today but that is not an excuse to slow down – in fact, over the next few weeks you will have to work harder than ever. As a Capricorn you will never reach a point where you are satisfied with your lot.
capricorn,Make the most of today’s positive influences to impress employers and other important people. You have the happy knack of knowing the right thing to say, in the right way at the right time, and it won’t be long before others are trying to impress you. ,capricorn,So long as you enjoy what you are doing it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks about it. You’ve had a tendency of late to take other people’s opinions into account a little too much but today and over the weekend you will make up for it big time.
capricorn,The Sun may no longer be moving through your sign but you still have time to make your mark. There is also the very real possibility that one or more of your ideas could start making big money over the next few days. It’s all coming together.
capricorn,Whatever else you do over the next 24 hours, don’t panic. If you let your fears get the better of you then the decisions you make will be all over the place. In a few days time you will look back and realize there was precious little to genuinely worry about.
capricorn,These may be serious times for some but you are finding it hard to be worried about what’s going on. With your Capricorn sense of the absurd you can no doubt see that it’s all a bit of a joke – and jokes make you laugh.
capricorn,If you need to do something about your money situation now is the time. Cosmic activity in the main financial area of your chart will help you make changes that, while painful in the short-term, will yield rewards in the long-term.
capricorn,You never like to admit you got something wrong but if you speak up now there will be no hard feelings and no financial repercussions. However, if you leave it for even 24 hours your apologies may not be accepted by those who have lost out. ,capricorn,Look back over the past few months and ask yourself what you actually achieved. Rather a lot, most likely, so why are you still feeling down? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it because new opportunities are coming. Be ready for them. ,capricorn,Might never makes right and you will make it your business today to see that the good guys come out on top. Always be guided by your principles and never allow yourself to be bought or bullied into changing you views. Fight for what you believe. ,capricorn,This is potentially one of the most creative times of the year, a time when you can take an idea and turn it into something real and substantial. If there is something you desire make sure others know about it – and soon it will be yours.
capricorn,Usually your instincts are spot on but the planets warn this will be one of those days when they cannot be trusted. You can, however, trust what a friend tells you, so listen carefully and act on their advice. Their intuition seems to be working better than yours. ,capricorn,Not everyone is as logical as you and some people can be remarkably sensitive, so try not to criticize friends and family members too harshly. There is a way to break unpleasant news, a way that calls for tact and understanding. It’s a way you must learn. ,capricorn,If friends and family members go out of their way to give you advice today you should go out of your way to listen to it. If you don’t you may regret it towards the end of the week. They are not trying to interfere – they are trying to help.
capricorn,Upheavals of one sort or another are likely today and there is not much you can do about them. The good news is that come the weekend you will move into a more positive phase, one in which you can call the shots for a change. ,capricorn,Someone in a position of authority will get a bit emotional today and you must do what you can to calm them down. Not only will they appreciate your advice but they will mark you down as someone who can be trusted and that’s surely good news for you. ,capricorn,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs what you own and what you earn will bring money matters into sharper focus over the next few days and you will become aware that certain people have been taking advantage of you. Cut them adrift.
capricorn,Venus joins with Pluto in your sign today and even the most self-controlled Capricorn will be a raging ball of passion! If there is someone you have fancied from afar now is the time to let them know how you feel. You’ll sweep them off their feet.
capricorn,You will find it easier to communicate with those you live and work with this coming week, but watch out you don’t say too much. Try not to let slip information that could be used against you. Remember, knowledge is power that cuts both ways.
capricorn,Don’t worry too much about your money situation because there are more important things you should be thinking about. Best of all, today’s new moon will help you find ways to earn more. You will soon pay off what you owe.
capricorn,If you are planning a trip today it might be wise to check ahead and make sure there is nothing that could hold you back. Even then you should allow more time for your journey than usual. You will reach your destination but it may take a while. ,capricorn,You may think that time is running out but there is still time to do something out of the ordinary, something that others will talk about for years to come. Don’t waste any more time making plans, just do what feels right in the moment – and enjoy it.
capricorn,You are worrying too much about your money situation and the more you worry the more likely it is that something will go wrong. A few days from now you will look back and wonder why you made such a big fuss over something so small. ,capricorn,You will get more than one opportunity to boost your income over the next few days, so don’t worry if your cash flow situation does not look too happy at the moment. The planets indicate there is some seriously big money in your future.
capricorn,You will have to work hard to keep your emotions in check this weekend. But if you do lose your temper don’t feel too bad about it because most likely you will have suffered the kind of provocation even a saint would find hard to ignore. ,capricorn,You may feel you have gone as far as you can go with a project of some kind but the planets indicate there is life in it yet. If you give up now you will surely regret it around the time the moon is full a week from now.
capricorn,If you try to force others to follow your lead over the next 24 hours they are sure to refuse. If, however, you use some of your considerable Capricorn charm you will find it easy to move them in the direction you want them to go. A no-brainer. ,capricorn,You need to get your cashflow situation in order and with values planet Venus moving in your favor that should not be too hard to do. If you need help, financially or otherwise, don’t be afraid to ask for it. You won’t be refused. ,capricorn,It may at times seem as if the world is ganging up on you but that is an illusion and deep down you know it. Other are not blaming you for what has gone wrong, they are just pointing out where they think you could have done better. ,capricorn,You will be on the move a lot over the next few weeks but today it will pay you to stay where you are and get your thoughts together. An extremely busy phase is about to begin and once you start you won’t want, or be able, to stop. ,capricorn,You have nothing to fear from the changes taking place around you – in fact you are likely to profit from them. Over the next 48 hours major pieces of the jigsaw will begin to fall into place, and the picture they reveal will delight you. ,capricorn,Once you have made up your mind about something you refuse to change your point of view – it’s just how you are. Having said which, if the whole world believes one thing while you believe the opposite it could be you who has got it wrong.
capricorn,You have all the chat and all the charm you need to win friends and influence people, so reach out to those you would usually be afraid to approach because you think they are somehow too good for you. They won’t be above you for long. ,capricorn,You need to get tough and let whoever is giving you a hard time know that you will no longer stand there and take what they dish out. You are under no obligation to be nice to people who are not nice to you – today or any other day.
capricorn,You seem to be flavor of the month with just about everyone at the moment, which is nice. By all means make the most of it but don’t get carried away and give someone the idea that they mean more to you emotionally than is actually the case. ,capricorn,You are under no obligation to be nice to someone but you realize they may be useful to you in the near future, so try to stay on good terms. There must be something about them you can find to like. Focus on that and forget the rest. ,capricorn,It feels as if something important is going out of your life but don’t worry because something way more important will soon come in to replace it. Most important of all though is that you think you deserve the best – because then you will get it.
capricorn,It sometimes amazes you how people of so little talent do so well for themselves on nothing more than ego and energy. Which means, of course, that someone as capable as you should be doing many times better. It’s your turn to shine.
capricorn,Fate will point you in a new direction over the next few days and if you are smart you will go with the flow. There is no need to worry because the cosmic powers that be will be looking over you and you will always be well protected.
capricorn,The more you try to analyze your current situation the more complicated it looks, so why not take the hint and let it be? Focus on things you feel more comfortable with. If you take your mind off your problems they may cease to be problems.
capricorn,You need to get tough and let whoever is giving you a hard time know that you will no longer stand there and take what they dish out. You are under no obligation to be nice to people who are not nice to you – today or any other day.
capricorn,Push worries to the back of your mind and resolve to have fun. The Sun in Pisces brings social and travel opportunities aplenty, so there is no excuse why you should be stuck at home in a bad mood. Get out there – the world wants to see you!,capricorn,Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart will reach critical mass today but if there is some kind of explosion the results should be positive. At the very least you will know why a loved one needs more of your attention. Give it to them.
capricorn,Go all out to make a good impression on those you live and work with today. Creatively and romantically this is a great time for you and if you believe that you deserve to be lucky and loved then you most surely will be.
capricorn,Friends and family members are putting you under pressure to conform and you don’t like it one bit. You are right to be annoyed. Other people’s expectations must not be allowed to play any part in your deliberations. You alone are master of your fate. ,capricorn,For some strange reason you feel compelled to say or do something shocking. Deep down you know you will regret it if you do but you just cannot help yourself. Maybe you have run out of enemies. Maybe you need to create a few more!,capricorn,For quite some time now someone has been trying to let you know that they see you as more than just a friend or colleague. But do you feel the same way about them? Some time soon you will have to decide and let them know.
capricorn,The current cosmic set-up indicates you have important things to take care of. Yes, they are boring and, yes, there are a dozen other things you would rather be doing, but you have responsibilities to live up to. Live up to them now.
capricorn,You need to get out and about more and today’s solar eclipse will provide you with no end of opportunities. Don’t worry that some people complain that you are being irresponsible, just do what feels right to you. Living well is the best revenge.
capricorn,Continue to think positive and continue to believe that everything will work out for the best in the end – and it will. Nothing in life is ever so bad that it cannot be improved by the way you choose to deal with it. Your mind creates your world. ,capricorn,You will eventually get the chance to rise in your work or career, but it will happen sooner if you get in the habit of believing that you deserve to be a leader rather than a follower. Take advantage of new opportunities – because if you don’t your rivals will.
capricorn,You may be tempted to say or do something a bit outrageous this weekend but think carefully before you act. To you it may be harmless fun but others won’t be quite so easygoing about it. Not everyone shares your sense of the ridiculous. ,capricorn,Resist the urge to spend big during the early part of the week because there will be unexpected bills to pay – and if you have used up all your cash how will you make ends meet? Make sure that your finances are in good order. ,capricorn,Knowing what you want to do is just the first step – you still have to go out and make it happen. Now you have started on your quest you must see it through to the end. You may be tired but you can and you will carry on.
capricorn,While others are complaining that life is unfair you will be quietly going about your business in a state of calm and careful determination. It won’t be in the least bit difficult to find ways to make the events of the day work in your favor. ,capricorn,You must think before you act today, especially if there is money changing hands. As a cardinal sign you are eager to succeed but the planets warn you could easily be taken in by someone who knows how to play on your desires. Be careful. ,capricorn,It might be wise not to make your plans public until you are 100 per cent sure you are going to go through with them. The more people know about your thought processes the more unnecessary pressure you will put on yourself. ,capricorn,The more you have been rushing here, there and everywhere in recent weeks, the more you must slow down and focus on matters closer to home. Give your full attention to partners and loved ones and focus less on your social life. ,capricorn,If someone you care for seems a bit distant this weekend don’t worry about it – it is not because of anything you may have said or done. Sometimes loved ones just need a little space to themselves – you of all people should understand that.
capricorn,Are you fighting for something you genuinely feel strongly about or is it something you have allowed others to persuade you needs to be done? If it’s the latter you must disentangle yourself over the next few days. And don’t get trapped so easily again.
capricorn,You seem to have dug a hole for yourself and can’t find a way out. Fortunately there are plenty of people who can assist you, but you have got to put your pride aside and ask them. Don’t get snappy if they point out your mistakes.
capricorn,Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart will bring out the best in your nature over the next few days. Whatever you have been fussing and fighting about with partners and loved ones, put it behind you – it is no longer important. ,capricorn,You may be ambitious by nature but today you must stand back and let someone else bask in the limelight. Your ego is not so big that you need to be top dog each and every time. You will get your chance again in the future. ,capricorn,You are not the sort to avoid responsibility and that’s good because there are important tasks that need to be dealt with. You will need to motivate yourself to get started but once you are on your way you will soon get into an easy rhythm. ,capricorn,Start the weekend a few hours early. Give yourself a break from work and go out and have fun with your friends. Better still, treat the one you love to a night out on the town, followed by a fun weekend doing the things you both enjoy. ,capricorn,Someone will appeal to your baser instincts, such as greed and ambition, this weekend but don’t be misled. No matter what they offer you it must be seen for what it is: a bribe. You may get what you desire but at what cost to your self-respect?,capricorn,Shouting at people who make a poor job of things won’t improve their performance – in fact they may fall apart completely. What you must do is to lead by example. Show them how it should be done, then assure them they can be just as good.
capricorn,A friend will say something unkind about you today but there is no reason to end your relationship. Their words are not intended to hurt or harm you in any way – on the contrary, they most likely think they are doing you a favor. ,capricorn,Everyone gets things wrong once in a while – yes, even a Capricorn – so don’t be too hard on yourself if you discover that you have been moving in the wrong direction. It won’t take much effort to get back on track. You adapt easily.
capricorn,Take time out from your busy schedule to help someone who is clearly struggling. You may not get much in the way of thanks for it now but your kindness will be remembered later on when it matters most – when it’s you who needs help. ,capricorn,What happens next will force you to confront issues that you would otherwise choose to ignore. What you must learn is that you cannot escape the past. But why would you want to escape it when your past is so much a part of who you are?,capricorn,There comes a time when even the most patient of Capricorns has to let their tormentors know that they have had enough – and for you that time is now. The more certain people have taken liberties the more ruthless you must be with them. ,capricorn,Try to be more understanding of someone who has let you down or in some other way incurred your displeasure. If you can find it in your heart to forgive and forget they, too, will raise their game and, later on, repay you for your kindness.
capricorn,Anyone who takes liberties over the next 24 hours will soon wish they had taken a less dangerous course of action. With Pluto so strong in your sign it won’t take much in the way of provocation to set you off. Watch out world!,capricorn,Be wary of people who arrive bearing gifts for no good reason. It could be they genuinely want to be nice but it could also be they are up to something. You may not want to be suspicious but you don’t want to lose out either, do you? ,capricorn,You may not be entirely happy with the way things are going on the work front but don’t make any major changes just yet. Fate will bring you the right opportunity at just the right time – all you have to do is be ready for it. ,capricorn,It may seem to others as if you are confident in the extreme but you know it’s a bit of an act – by nature you are a cautious individual. Hopefully your caution will deter you from joining with others to take some kind of foolish risk this weekend.
capricorn,This is one of the most important times of the year for you, though definitely not one of the easiest. The most important lesson you will learn over the next few days is that you cannot always get your own way. Learn it the easy way. ,capricorn,You may be angry with someone who has let you down but don’t criticize them in front of other people. If you do you will do even more damage to their already fragile ego and they may never recover. Do you want that on your conscience?,capricorn,Don’t waste your precious time and your energy trying to explain what you are doing or why you are doing it. If you feel it is the right thing for you then just get on with it and pay no attention to what others might say.
capricorn,You must look out for your own interests today, especially if there is money at stake. If you get a tip from a family member or a friend there is every chance it is worth following up. Don’t hesitate or you may miss your chance. ,capricorn,You need to come out of your shell and show the world what a fun-loving person you are. Today’s Mercury-Jupiter link will boost positive thoughts and before you know it you will be flying, mentally, emotionally and maybe physically too! ,capricorn,There is a simple reason why you cannot get friends and relatives to see things your way and that is because they know you are wrong. Just this once listen to what they are trying to tell you – it will save you both embarrassment and money.
capricorn,The planets warn that if you take on someone in a position of power you will quickly find that you cannot win. If you are smart you will back off until such time as you have a genuine chance of competing on equal terms.
capricorn,The Sun moves into the most adventurous area of your chart on Tuesday, so by all means take a few risks and have a good time. Also, if you have been planning a vacation, now is the time to turn your plans into action.sally bro,capricorn,Don’t sit back and wait for things to happen – get out into the world and make them happen. With the Sun moving into the most dynamic area of your chart tomorrow there is no limit to how high you can climb or how much you can achieve.
capricorn,Whatever restrictions you have been laboring under these past few weeks will be swept away as the Sun moves into the most creative and dynamic area of your chart. Whatever stopped you from moving forward before is no longer an issue.
capricorn,There is still plenty of time to get started on that once-in-a-lifetime project you have been thinking about for so long, so don’t try to cram everything into the next 24 hours. The planning stage may be over but take care with your next step.
capricorn,You may be eager to get started on a project you have been planning for ages but be patient. The next few days will see you at your most dynamic but you must have a clear idea of what you want and how you intend to get it. ,capricorn,There may be no obvious reason for what takes place in your life today but don’t let that stop you from taking advantage of it. Everything that happens in and around you is there for you to use – you don’t have to feel guilty about it.
capricorn,It’s time to let certain people know that if they don’t start pulling their weight they can look elsewhere for what you have to offer them. And don’t bluff. It’s not enough to say it, you have got to mean it as well.
capricorn,You will get a lot done in a short space of time over the next few days. Make the most of it because it won’t always be this easy. Be careful that a clash of egos over a creative matter later in the week does not get out of hand.
capricorn,There are some powerful emotions raging at the moment and you won’t be able to lie low until the storm has passed. If someone goes out of their way to annoy you, go out of your way to annoy them back. It’s the only language they understand. ,capricorn,Someone appears to believe that you have been taking them for granted and the sooner you wise up to that fact, and do something about it, the less likely it is to result in a major falling-out. Tell them how much you appreciate their efforts. ,capricorn,This is a productive time for you, so decide what it is you want to achieve and get on with it. Too many times in the past you fell short in your aims because you did not truly believe in yourself, but now you do – so act!,capricorn,Your powers of persuasion have rarely been higher but you still need to tread carefully when dealing with people both socially and at work. You may think you have won them over but can you be certain? The planets say not!,capricorn,Doing things for friends and family should be your new priority, because what you do for them now will be done for you later on. You don’t have to make sacrifices above and beyond the call of duty – just lend a helping hand when needed. ,capricorn,You must go easy on yourself, both physically and emotionally, this weekend. According to the planets you have driven yourself beyond your natural limits of late and if you carry on at this pace something is sure to give. Don’t let it be you.
capricorn,Venus, planet of romance, is transiting one of the best areas of your chart at the moment, so even the most reserved Capricorn will be more bubbly and outgoing over the next few days. Just be careful the love bug does not get the better of you.
capricorn,Your confidence is sky-high at the moment and with the Sun moving through the most dynamic area of your chart it is sure to go even higher over the next few days. Success is no longer a case of “if” but of “when.”,capricorn,What happens today can be seen as a reward for something you did for a friend or even a stranger in the past. It may be something big or it may be something small but there is no doubt at all that you deserve your good fortune. ,capricorn,Try not to get upset with a partner or work colleague who you think has insulted you in some way. Most likely you are overreacting – you can be rather touchy at times – so take a deep breath and count to 10. Better still, make it 100.
capricorn,You need to get creative and get a project that has been in the pipeline for ages off the ground at long last. Don’t let the fact that you have so many other tasks on your plate deter you – it’s a now or never situation. ,capricorn,Something that has been bothering you for a while will come to a head today and, most likely, you will realize you have been worrying for no good reason. The new moon promises good things for those Capricorns who remember how to smile.
capricorn,It may seem as if someone is making life difficult for you, and maybe they are, but there is a reason for it. They want to find out what you are like under pressure, so stay calm and don’t let their seemingly selfish behavior distract you.
capricorn,A problem that has been annoying you for ages will resolve itself over the next few days and you will be amazed how simple the solution is. The only reason you did not see it earlier is because you were thinking in too limited a way.
capricorn,It seems you have been taking too much for granted and what happens later in the week will remind you that it is never a good idea to get carried away with your own brilliance. Today though, there are no end of reasons to smile.
capricorn,Venus and Jupiter are beautifully linked across the two most dynamic areas of your chart today, so wherever you go and whatever you do life will be fun. If you turn on the charm you will get anything – yes anything – your heart desires. ,capricorn,People are sure to drag their feet and place obstacles in your path today but you must not react harshly. The best tactic is to pretend that you are not in the least bit concerned, then they will get bored and go in search of an easier target. ,capricorn,The Sun in Taurus and Jupiter in Virgo – signs you have an affinity with – are doing wonders for your state of mind. Just be careful you don’t go from one extreme to the other and act as if there is no risk. There is always a risk. ,capricorn,You seem to be rushing all over the place without actually getting much done. Make a conscious effort to slow right down and take stock of what it is you are trying to accomplish. Most likely you are getting nowhere fast because you are aiming too high.
capricorn,Venus, planet of harmony, links with Pluto in your sign this weekend, so you will be forceful in an acceptable way. Also, if there is someone you want to get close to emotionally now is the time to make your move. Let them know how you feel.
capricorn,There will be times over the next few days when you wonder if maybe you have taken on more than you can handle. Make an effort to identify areas where you can cut back on your workload without adversely affecting your long-term aims. ,capricorn,There is a lot of tension in the air at the moment but you cannot work out from which direction it is coming. Maybe someone is telling tales behind your back but more likely you are just hyper-sensitive to criticism. Lighten up, it’s life.
capricorn,Don’t say things just to make other people feel good – even more so if it makes you feel bad. One of the things that marks you out from the crowd is your willingness to call it as you see it, even when what you see is less than nice. ,capricorn,Don’t listen to those who say that what you dream about isn’t possible – it may be out of reach for them but it certainly is not out of reach for someone of your exceptional talents. If you can imagine it you can make it a reality.
capricorn,Chances are you have been moving too fast and doing too much for your own good in recent weeks. Now you need to slow down a bit and take better care of your health. Take care of loved ones too as they may be feeling neglected.
capricorn,You have been amazingly energetic in recent weeks but now the Sun is moving into the wellbeing area of your chart you must slow down and make sure you don’t burn yourself out. Not even a Capricorn can keep such a pace going forever. ,capricorn,There is no point trying to hide your feelings because the full moon won’t let you. Later on, when you have calmed down a bit, you may regret letting your emotions get the better of you but, for now, it feels good to let it all out. ,capricorn,A little bit of what you fancy is, of course, a good thing but the danger this week is that you won’t be satisfied with just a little. If you get greedy and demand more than you are entitled to you could start a feud that never ends. ,capricorn,If you are smart you will realize that certain people are not in the best of moods and will watch what you say when they are within listening distance. If you stir things up with no good reason it could be you who suffers the most.
capricorn,A loved one will be a bit sulky today and whatever you do to cheer them up is unlikely to work. In which case you should leave them alone and just get on with your life. If they want to wallow in misery, that’s up to them.
capricorn,It is beginning to dawn on you that a colleague does not, after all, have your best interests at heart. Your sixth sense rarely lets you down, so stand back from the situation, see it for what it is, and take the appropriate action. ,capricorn,A minor matter will get blown up out of all proportion today. The important thing is that you can see the situation for what it is – so much hot air – and not overreact. Let it all go over your head – you have more important things to worry about. ,capricorn,What a friend or work colleague is telling you may sound logical but a nagging voice at the back of your brain is warning that something is amiss. Take the hint and hold off from making changes until you know for certain what is going on. ,capricorn,You know what you want and you know where to get it but before you reach out and make it your own ask yourself if it is likely to cause bad blood with colleagues and friends. It may be the case that the trade-off isn’t worth it. ,capricorn,If you have been planning a change of some sort, now is the time to get serious about it. Don’t listen to those who urge caution – just because they are afraid to take chances does not mean you have to be. Let your inner voice guide you.
capricorn,You need to break free of a habit that has been holding you back. The planets will give you the shove you need to climb out of your rut and the sense of freedom you feel will be amazing. Never let anything hold you back again. ,capricorn,Your financial situation isn’t as bad as you think it is, so stop worrying. You should know by now that fearing the worst makes no sense at all because negative thoughts invite negative events. Think and act with confidence at all times today. ,capricorn,You need to be aware of the dangers of pushing yourself too hard and straining either your mind or your body, or both! You should certainly avoid taking on other people’s workloads as well as your own. Learn to say “no” – and mean it.
capricorn,You may not want to go back and look again at something you thought was done and dusted but according to the planets you have no choice. The evidence is clear that you got the wrong end of the stick, so you will have to make changes.
capricorn,You may be tempted to take a gamble of some sort today but the planets warn you need to be cautious. It may not be true, as some rivals claim, that your big idea simply won’t work, but it will certainly need a bit of a rethink.
capricorn,You may be tempted to take a gamble of some sort today but the planets warn you need to be cautious. It may not be true, as some rivals claim, that your big idea simply won’t work, but it will certainly need a bit of a rethink. ,capricorn,If a job is worth doing it is worth getting paid for and with this week’s new moon taking place in the work area of your chart you should be charging top dollar. Perfection, which is what you are offering, comes cheap whatever the price.
capricorn,Your respect for tradition is one of your strong points but sometimes you have to bring your ideas up to date. A new routine is necessary and if you move a small way with the times now you won’t have to move a long way later on.
capricorn,The planets warn you are expecting too much of yourself and need to lower your sights a little. It would help, of course, if you could get over the notion that you need to prove yourself to other people. You don’t. You are perfect just as you are.
capricorn,You seemed determined to put yourself to the test at the moment, to prove that you have what it takes to succeed. But who are you trying to prove it to: yourself or other people? Most likely it’s the latter, but is that really necessary?,capricorn,You will be in two minds which direction to take today – so you might as well stay right where you are and let the world come to you. Mind planet Mercury warns that the only safe decisions are the decisions you manage to avoid. ,capricorn,The Sun in the health area of your chart warns you must go easy on yourself, physically, mentally and emotionally, because if you push too hard now you will burn yourself out later on – and then you will be of no use to anyone. ,capricorn,You won’t hesitate to come to the rescue if a friend is in trouble this weekend. You must, however, be smart and limit your assistance to good advice only. Don’t do for them what they should be doing for themselves – that won’t help in the slightest.
capricorn,If you want things to work out to your benefit then you will have to take control and take the kind of difficult decisions you too often try to avoid. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your work and your health. ,capricorn,If you feel that your life is in a bit of a rut at the moment then try doing the opposite of what you usually do. Don’t worry that friends and family members might think you have gone off your head – do whatever it takes to liven things up.
capricorn,The most important thing today is that you don’t go over the top, physically, verbally or emotionally. Think before you speak, speak before you act, and act only when you really have to. Sometimes the best move is to move nothing at all. ,capricorn,Try not to fret that your efforts might not work and you will end up looking silly. You should know by now that negative thoughts have a way of making negative things come about, so banish those doubts and think only of success. ,capricorn,Why are you still depressed about things that have gone out of your life? The planets suggest that whatever you have lost in recent weeks will be replaced very soon by something many times better. Always look forward, never look back. ,capricorn,You need to be less suspicious in your dealings with other people. Over the next few days any fears you had that friends or colleagues were plotting against you will be swept away and you will realize there was never any reason to worry at all.
capricorn,You may not agree with what a friend is up to but you have to accept that they are entitled to follow their own path. You may live by certain principles but not everyone looks at life the same way as you. Let them get on with it. ,capricorn,Partnership issues will come to the fore this week and there can be no more running away from them. They won’t be such a problem if you make a conscious effort to take other people’s viewpoints into account. Don’t be too narrow in your thinking.
capricorn,Today’s full moon warns you will find it easy to take what others say the wrong way – and the results could be embarrassing. You are advised to react positively to even the most negative piece of news. Most likely it isn’t as bad as you think.
capricorn,You know something that others do not, something that gives you an edge. Whatever that something happens to be you must be careful that you do not give the game away by dropping too many hints. Knowledge is power only so long as it is secret. ,capricorn,Others may be critical of your efforts but that’s okay. You have handled such negative comments before and you know that the last thing you should do is to retreat into your shell and hide away from the world. Take on the doubters head-to-head. ,capricorn,Some serious things will happen over the next few days and there will be times when you find it hard to smile. But although things may be tough in the short-term they will be much better in the long-term, so take the rough with the smooth. ,capricorn,You may think you can go it alone but the planets indicate you will find it easier to reach your goals if you team up with people who share your ambitions. You don’t have to be friends, you just have to be able to work together.
capricorn,Energy and enthusiasm will combine to make all things possible for you this weekend. Pluto in your sign is a powerful enough influence by itself, but allied with Jupiter, planet of luck, you are clearly on to a winner. There is no end to what you can achieve.
capricorn,The moment you get one task out of the way over the coming week another will land in your lap, forcing you to push yourself beyond your usual limits. However, the effort you put in now will pay big dividends later. It’s an investment.
capricorn,You will be under a lot of pressure today and there is a chance that you will fall out with people you usually get along with. Make sure you stick up for yourself – don’t let others get away with things they do not deserve. ,capricorn,Someone whose support you rely on will be critical of your efforts today and you won’t be best pleased. However, before you hit back maybe you should look more closely at what they are saying. Maybe – shock, horror – they are right.
capricorn,You will go out of your way to avoid confrontation over the next 24 hours. However, in some areas that may not be such a good thing. On the work front, especially, there is a danger you will do too much for others and not enough for yourself. ,capricorn,You won’t be much in the mood for socializing today but that’s okay. Conserve your energy, and your resources too, because the weekend and the early part of next week will be full of surprises – the kind you thoroughly enjoy.
capricorn,If others push you too far they will most likely regret it. Having said that, it would be wise to avoid outright confrontation. If your relationships, at home or at work, get a little heated over the next 24 hours, make yourself scarce for a while.
capricorn,Why are you worrying about one thing to such an extent that it is stopping you from focusing on other, more important, issues? It really isn’t worth getting worked up about. Also, the more you worry about it the more likely it is to happen.
capricorn,This is potentially one of the best times of the year for affairs of the heart. Let your nearest and dearest know how much you care for them and how much you appreciate their efforts. It may have been a long time since you told them. ,capricorn,There are times when you wonder why you put up with a certain individual’s behavior and you will no doubt consider cutting them out of your life altogether today. Don’t be too hasty. The new moon means you can find common ground.
capricorn,There is no point trying to make sense of what is entirely without reason. The more you try to analyze your current situation the more complicated it will look, so leave well alone and focus on simpler, and more enjoyable, issues. ,capricorn,This is an excellent time for affairs of the heart as Venus, planet of love, links with Mars, planet of action. Even if you are the kind of Capricorn who is shy by nature you will be both chatty and charming today. You just can’t lose!,capricorn,A dispute of some kind will tax your patience today but it is nothing new – you have been through this scene many times before. So you should know how best to handle it, right? Stay calm and call on all those previous experiences. ,capricorn,Time spent helping others will not be time wasted and your kind words and good deeds will touch the lives not only of the individuals directly involved but thousands of others as well. Be someone who makes a difference. Be a force for positive change.
capricorn,It may annoy you that you have been cut out of the information loop but what happens today will help you understand why others found it so difficult to confide in you. Maybe they thought you would not approve. And maybe they were right!,capricorn,The only danger at the moment is that in your rush to get ahead in the world you push yourself too hard and put your wellbeing at risk. There is a simple rule you can follow to make sure you stay healthy: don’t go to extremes.
capricorn,It may seem as if others are ganging up on you but that just reflects your unwillingness to take criticism. They are not blaming you for the ills of the world, they are pointing out where they think you’ve gone wrong. Maybe you should listen.
capricorn,Practice what you preach and don’t take short cuts. That in a nutshell is the message of the planets today and if you heed it you won’t go far wrong. But if you ignore it you will soon lose your short-term advantage. Think quality, not quantity.
capricorn,You will find it easy to persuade others to do things for you today. But will they do as good a job as you would have done? Probably not. Important tasks must not be handed on to a third party. Find time to do them yourself. ,capricorn,As mind planet Mercury moves into one of the deeper areas of your chart today you won’t be satisfied with shallow explanations – you want to know what is going on beneath the surface and behind the scenes. Watch out for conspiracy theories.
capricorn,Each time you think you have got life worked out something happens to bring back your doubts. Yes, of course, it’s frustrating but it happens for a reason. Never allow yourself to believe that you have found the ultimate answer – it’s not possible.
capricorn,By all means enjoy yourself over the next 48 hours but don’t get carried away and give certain people the idea that they mean more to you emotionally and romantically than is actually the case. Tread carefully where matters of the heart are concerned.
capricorn,Tuesday’s full moon in your sign will help you come to a new understanding with someone you’ve had a rather rough relationship with in recent months. Discuss your differences rationally and find ways to resolve them so that you both benefit.
capricorn,Tomorrow’s full moon in your sign means you must expect a few upheavals, both at home and at work. That might not sound good but if you dread life less you may find you enjoy it more. There are always good reasons to smile.
capricorn,Today’s full moon in your sign makes you fear the worst over a partnership matter, but you really don’t need to be so pessimistic. Rest assured this is just a passing phase and by the end of the week you will be the best of friends again.
capricorn,You may not be openly passionate by nature but something will get under your skin to such an extent today that you may well go over the top about it. That’s good. You should vent your spleen and let off steam more often! ,capricorn,Take time out of your busy schedule to look back over the past six months and see what progress you have made. Most likely you will be amazed how far you have come in such a short space of time. But don’t stop. There are no limits. ,capricorn,It’s not often you question your motives or the workings of your mind but over the next few weeks you will start looking for answers to some rather profound questions, those of the “who am I?” and “what does it all mean?” variety. ,capricorn,Even the most unadventurous Capricorn will be tempted by what is on offer this weekend. The only danger is it may bring with it hidden costs. But what of it? Who is going to care how much you paid one hundred years from now? ,capricorn,You will do something out of the ordinary this week, something that someone as safe and traditional as you would never be expected to try. That’s good. If your instincts tell you to go for it you must not hesitate for even a second.
capricorn,Pluto in your sign makes you believe that all things are possible, that you can overcome each and every challenge, but other influences warn there are powers at work that are too great for you to control. Choose your battles carefully this week.
capricorn,It may seem as if certain matters are going against you but there is no need to worry. The Sun in Leo at this time of year makes the going seem tougher than it really is, so hang on in there and expect your luck to change soon.
capricorn,Forget about your duties and responsibilities today and have a good time. There may be a thousand and one things you should be doing but they can wait until you feel motivated to tackle them. When will that be? Who knows and who cares! ,capricorn,If there is something about your lifestyle that you dislike then change it. However, before you do, ask yourself honestly if you really dislike it that much or if you are just bored and looking for something new. Think carefully before you act. ,capricorn,It may annoy you that certain individuals are so stubborn in their opinions but most likely from their point of view they think the same of you. The simple fact is your viewpoints are so radically different there can be no meeting of minds. ,capricorn,If you want to be left alone over the next few days you must let everyone know about it. The fact is you need to spend some time by yourself to get your thoughts in order. You don’t have to be there for others every minute of every day.
capricorn,If you want to be left alone over the next few days you must let everyone know about it. The fact is you need to spend some time by yourself to get your thoughts in order. You don’t have to be there for others every minute of every day.
capricorn,At some point today you will realize that it is time to move on. There may be one or two regrets, even tears, but that is natural. The good news is that what comes next will be much more enjoyable and productive than what went before.
capricorn,You need to go on the offensive now, especially where money matters and business issues are concerned. It won’t take much of an effort to bring the good things in life your way, so be assertive and never accept less than you are worth.
capricorn,You need to slow down. You need to stop buzzing around here, there and everywhere and take a long, hard look at your life. There are a number of things that need changing but first you must make sure you know what they are. ,capricorn,The more others say bad things about you today the more you will know that your words and actions are having the desired effect. Redouble your commitment and your efforts and let them know you will not be cowed into silence. ,capricorn,If you have been thinking of taking a vacation this is the ideal time to break out the holiday brochures and start making serious plans. However, don’t get carried away and book a trip that costs a fortune – budget deals can be just as much fun.
capricorn,Partners, relatives and friends need to be encouraged, not criticized. If you go out of your way to be supportive of others now you are more likely to get their support later on – and the planets indicate you may need it sooner than you expected.
capricorn,Friends, family and work colleagues all think you are special. Even strangers want to get close to you. There is something of the film star about you – everyone is desperate to take a selfie with you. Enjoy it but don’t let it go to your head.
capricorn,You are doing too many things for too many people and if you carry on this way you will burn yourself out very soon. Tell those who have been taking your assistance for granted that as from today they are on their own. And mean it.
capricorn,Your luck will turn and your confidence will soar today. Jupiter in the sympathetic sign of Virgo is a brilliant omen and soon you will be enjoying the kind of success you hardly dared dream about. Enjoy your good fortune – you’ve earned it.
capricorn,You seem to have a bit of a defeatist attitude at the moment but later in the month you will see why you were wrong to think the world was against you. For now though you must just take it on faith. Worry is a useless emotion.
capricorn,So long as you remember not to take liberties today partners and loved ones and work colleagues alike will go out of their way to do what you ask of them. Just remember that any favors they do for you will at some point have to be repaid.
capricorn,Try not to get emotional about something that nine times out of ten would not bother you in the slightest. If you let your feelings, especially negative feelings, get in the way of common sense it could cost you dear. It’s really no big deal. ,capricorn,There will be times this weekend when you want to be left alone with your thoughts. Make sure those you live and work with know that you need your own space and if they are not prepared to give it you will get up and go elsewhere.
capricorn,There will be times over the next few days when it feels as if you are out of your depth – but don’t give up on your dreams. Hang in there and do whatever it takes to keep your confidence high. Things are not as bad as you fear. ,capricorn,You have so much going for you at the moment but don’t take your good fortune for granted. Money matters are not under the best of stars this week and if you proceed as if you cannot possibly lose your impulsive behavior could cost you dear.
capricorn,The pressure is on you at the moment but that’s okay. As a Capricorn you tend to do best when pushed to your limits and the planets indicate you will make a complete success of whatever it is you are working on. You’ve got what it takes.
capricorn,Anyone who thinks they can take from you without giving anything of value in return will find out how wrong they are today. You may be cautious by nature but you can be a truly fearsome opponent when your anger is roused. ,capricorn,In your desperation to dig your way out of a financial hole you may end up digging it deeper, so think before you act – better still, don’t act at all. Today’s full moon makes your cashflow situation look worse than it is, so don’t worry so much. ,capricorn,There is no point looking back at the things you have done and wishing you had done them differently. The past is over and done with and all you can do now is learn from your mistakes and start moving forward again. Action will banish regret.
capricorn,Speak up if you need help this weekend. You may be surprised how easily the words come to your lips. You certainly won’t be your usual tongue-tied self. Let others know what you need from them and they will happily give it to you.
capricorn,The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow means you cannot put a foot wrong. Lady Luck is on your side one hundred per cent and you can and you must make the most of it. Just be careful you don’t take on too much and exhaust yourself.
capricorn,Ignore what friends and family members say you should be doing and do what feels right for you. No matter what their opinions may be you must trust your instincts and, most importantly, act on what they tell you – not later, but now!,capricorn,You can sense that something good is going to happen in your life, something that will not only make you happy but inspire you to help others be happy too. Your positive attitude will attract good fortune and good people wherever you go.
capricorn,It’s not like you to be scared of your own shadow but cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart makes you believe you have secret and powerful enemies. You don’t, but with an imagination like that you should be writing fiction!,capricorn,You will demand to be heard today and if others are smart they will let you say your piece. Some may disagree with your claims but most will see the sense in them. After that it is just a matter of getting them to change their ways. ,capricorn,The best way to impress employers and other important people is to make it appear as if you are in control of the situation. You may be as clueless about what’s going on as everyone else but if you fake it they will be none the wiser.
capricorn,Today’s fantastic link between Venus and Jupiter means you can expect good things to come your way over the next 48 hours. You will also be showered with praise by those who think you are the best thing that ever happened to them. And you are!,capricorn,You will receive some kind of offer this week and you will be reluctant to turn it down. But turn it down you must because it is not as good as it sounds – in fact it could be a deliberate attempt to part you from your cash.
capricorn,All one-to-one relationships will go well today but those where your heart is involved will bring more joy than you thought possible. If you are looking for love you will find it, and if you are in love already your affections will grow stronger.
capricorn,As the cosmic pattern begins to shift toward career matters again you should start thinking about how to get noticed and get moving up the ladder of success. Make sure employers and other important people know you exist and what you can do.
capricorn,If you feel like packing your bags and heading off into the bright blue yonder over the next few days then do so without a second thought or a backward glance. The moment you start questioning your actions is the moment the magic will begin to fade.
capricorn,Any restrictions that have been holding you back will be lifted over the next 24 hours. The sense of freedom you feel will be amazing but don’t go to the other extreme and refuse to accept any and all limitations. Some of them are actually helpful. ,capricorn,So long as you have planned carefully and not left anything to chance this should be an encouraging day. There will certainly be no further doubts in your mind that what you are doing is right. What others think about it is irrelevant.
capricorn,The Sun in Virgo at this time of year is an excellent influence and you no doubt have plenty to smile about. You may have neglected something that will have to be dealt with at a later date but for now it’s all about having fun.
capricorn,Why waste precious time and energy on new projects when there are so many existing things that need to be completed? It’s not like you to leave a job half finished, so pick up where you left off last week and this time get it done.
capricorn,You seem to be a lot more open and trusting of late, and that’s good because today’s beneficial cosmic influences mean your positive attitude will attract the right kind of people at just the right time. Let them make things happen for you. ,capricorn,Can you be sure that what others are telling you is fact? Just because the “experts” say something does not mean you have to believe them. Let your intuition guide you today and don’t be afraid to go down a completely different path. ,capricorn,If you need to ask a favor of a friend or family member now is the time to speak up. You don’t have to beg or make promises you may not be able to keep, you just have to let them know what you need – and you will get it. ,capricorn,Jupiter, planet of good fortune, moves into the career area of your chart today, which means you will be looking to boost your professional standing in some way. Aim high, then strive to go higher still. There should be no limits to your ambitions.
capricorn,It’s not like you to be reckless but the planets warn you could say or do something over the next 48 hours that puts what you have gained at risk. Find something simple and unimportant to focus on. Serious issues are best avoided.
capricorn,There will be times over the next few days when it feels as if everything is running away from you, that you are losing control of everyday events. Don’t worry. It won’t be long before you are back on top of things, so hang in there.
capricorn,It’s not like you to throw caution to the wind but something has inspired you to cast off restrictions and go all out for glory. Don’t let other people’s disapproving glances stop you from pursuing your dream. You’re having fun and that’s what counts.
capricorn,Today’s Sun-Mars link suggests you will lock horns with someone who is bigger and better connected than you, and you may have no choice but to back down. There is no point being a hero about it – live to fight another day.
capricorn,You will get the chance to settle an old score today but if you are smart you won’t take it. The approaching eclipse means you should go out of your way to heal rifts, not make them wider. Forgiveness is always better than vengeance.
capricorn,Because your mind is so active at the moment you must make sure that what you think you see is what is actually there. Not only will others try to trick you but you may even trick yourself. Too much imagination is not always a good thing. ,capricorn,Joint endeavors will go well for you over the next few days. You may not be much of a team player by nature but with a little bit of effort you can find ways to work with other people. Get everyone involved and everyone will win.
capricorn,It may appear as if a rival is trying to muscle in on your territory, and maybe they are, but you are advised not to make a big issue of it for the time being as the planets warn the situation could easily get out of hand. Be patient. ,capricorn,You should be used to criticism by now, so chances are you will ignore what your rivals say, and that’s good. The Sun in Virgo makes all things possible, but only for the next two days, so let your instincts guide you and then act fast.
capricorn,There is no need to rush things today, especially on the work front where it is more important to get a job done well than to get it done quickly. As always it is quality work that counts, so take your time and get it right. ,capricorn,If you are in any way dissatisfied with your lot, now is the time to do something about it. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart promises that changes are good for you, so be bold and start moving in a completely new direction.
capricorn,Friendships are under excellent stars at the moment, so if you are bored with where you are and what you are doing seek out people who make you smile. Forget about work and family issues and join with those who share your outlook on life. ,capricorn,Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart makes you hugely ambitious but you must focus your desire on a single goal for best results. If you scatter your energy in a dozen directions your accomplishments will be severely limited. ,capricorn,You may be inclined to tear down everything you have built and start again from scratch but don’t be hasty. You will regret it in the long-term if you destroy what you have created. Make room for both the old and the new in your life.
capricorn,The last few weeks, in fact the last few months, have been intense but as from today you will find it easier to relax. Surrender yourself to universal guidance and don’t worry about where you might end up – it is sure to be some place good.
capricorn,You will be singing your own praises loud and clear over the next few days, and no doubt with good reason. Just remember that whatever outrageous claims you make you will, eventually, be expected to back up your words with action.
capricorn,No doubt you have big plans and no doubt you have made all sorts of promises to yourself that this time you will get your act together and accomplish something you can be proud of. But don’t aim too high. Learn to walk before you run.
capricorn,Mars in your sign makes you hugely assertive and those you have dealings with, at home and at work, will be inspired by your can-do attitude. There has rarely been a better time to push yourself forward and take what it is you desire. ,capricorn,It’s good that you now have the confidence to take risks but that does not mean you should take them wildly. The approaching new moon in the career area of your chart means you will thrive, provided you don’t do anything silly!,capricorn,People who can help you in your career will come into your life over the next few days and if you listen to what they tell you it could make a huge difference to your long-term ambitions. Having said that, only you can make the ultimate decisions.
capricorn,Authority figures are watching you closely, so make sure you do a good job of whatever it is you are working on. Aim to make it the best thing you have ever done – and make sure you get paid the top rate for your efforts.
capricorn,Friends and work colleagues will be impressed by your willingness to call it as you see it today but authority figures may feel you are trying to undermine their position. Don’t put them in a situation where they have no choice but to hit back.
capricorn,There are a lot of things taking place behind the scenes at the moment, so don’t jump to conclusions and don’t make any major moves. Things will become clearer toward the end of the week. With luck you won’t have to make any changes at all.
capricorn,Mars in your birth sign makes you believe you can do as you please, but as the planet of energy squares up to Jupiter today the fallout from your actions could be colossal. Whatever else occurs don’t annoy people in positions of authority. ,capricorn,If you recently made an agreement or pact with someone then you must stick to it. You won’t do your reputation much good if you back out of the deal now. Impress important people with your grasp of detail and your devotion to duty. ,capricorn,Sometimes you can be too much of a perfectionist and with Pluto in your sign at odds with the Sun today you probably won’t be happy with your creative efforts. But don’t throw them away or destroy them – they will look good again tomorrow. ,capricorn,A problem you thought had been resolved will return to annoy you over the next 48 hours. Whatever it is and no matter how uncomfortable it may be, you have got to face up to it properly this time. No more half measures Capricorn.
capricorn,Make sure important people know who you are and what you can do. If you have been thinking about a career change then what happens over the next few days will point you in the right direction. After that it’s up to you. ,capricorn,This is potentially a great time for work-related matters but there is also a danger that you will go over the top and undo all the good things you have achieved in recent weeks. Self-belief is a wonderful thing but too much can be dangerous. ,capricorn,Go out of your way to convince people that you have what it takes to compete at the highest level. You are as good as the next person and better than most and it’s about time you started to believe that. Small successes will lead to bigger ones. ,capricorn,Mars in your sign makes you even more dynamic and decisive than you were before and anyone who does not believe that will believe it come the weekend. Seize the initiative and make sure the world knows you are a force to be reckoned with. ,capricorn,You may be in a rebellious frame of mind at the moment but you are advised not to rock the boat. A week or so from know you will be able to speak freely but in the meantime bite your tongue and let others do the talking. ,capricorn,You can, if you wish, force others to do your bidding this weekend but it’s unlikely to do you any lasting good. The most sensible course of action is to meet friends and colleagues halfway so everyone feels they have a stake in the outcome.
capricorn,Some people insist on making huge dramas out of what are really quite minor crises and today’s full moon will make matters worse. On the home front especially, logic and common sense will be in short supply this week, so bring your own.
capricorn,Don’t wait for a friend to ask for assistance: you can see they need help so make the first move. They may not want to be dependent on you but, on this occasion, it is clear they cannot cope on their own. Help them get back on their feet.
capricorn,Don’t push yourself too hard today. With both Mars and Pluto moving through your sign the temptation will be to go to extremes but the results are unlikely to be pretty. You still have all the time in the world to do what needs to be done.
capricorn,Where money matters and business issues are concerned you are strongly advised not to take anything for granted today because it could result in a loss of some kind. On the work front, in particular, you may not get the support you expected.
capricorn,You may fear that if you don’t do something soon you may not get another chance, but your impatience could be your undoing. Temper your eagerness with the knowledge that life always throws up new opportunities. There’s really no rush.
capricorn,Get out and about and meet up with like-minded people. Exactly what you are like-minded about is of secondary importance – what matters is that you open up to the idea that if you want to change the world you can’t do it alone. ,capricorn,The message of the stars for the week ahead is that you should forget about doing things purely for yourself and do things which benefit a wide range of people. Remember: what you do for others will always come back to you in the end.
capricorn,Like most people you tend to put up with situations that you do not fully understand, but as from today you will be much more willing to question the accepted wisdom. Ask the kind of awkward questions that others cannot wriggle out of answering.
capricorn,You have taken on a lot of new responsibilities in recent weeks and having made your choices you must live with the consequences. Show those you live and work with that you are not the sort who gives up easily. In fact, don’t give up at all.
capricorn,You may not feel like going out and having a good time but that is exactly what you must force yourself to do. The cure for sadness is action, so focus your mind on what makes you smile and don’t give a thought to anything else. ,capricorn,Something of a financial nature needs to be handled carefully but it also needs you to be decisive and make a final decision. The fact is you have sat on the fence long enough – so, which side are you going to come down on? ,capricorn,Saturn, your ruler, can make you a bit touchy at times, but it can also help find solutions to your emotional problems. If there is something you are worried about, now is the time to confront it and deal with it. Chances are it is nothing too bad. ,capricorn,Anyone who thinks they can order you around is going to get a big surprise this weekend and it won’t be the sort they enjoy. But be careful what you say to people in positions of power. You’ve got enough opponents as it is!,capricorn,Generally speaking you don’t like to play the heavy but your instincts tell you that if you don’t lay down the law about something right away others will openly disrespect you. Make an example of one individual and everyone else will get the message.
capricorn,Think carefully before agreeing to support a friend’s latest project. Is it likely to succeed? If it does not will you be obliged to step in and rescue it? Make sure your decision is based on facts and logic, not wishful thinking and emotion.
capricorn,You will encounter some kind of setback today but don’t let it alarm you because you will be back on track again very soon. A slight delay may in fact work in your favor, not least because it will give you time to check important details.
capricorn,You must not allow yourself to be lulled into a false sense of security. By all means enjoy the good things in life, by all means live for the present, but keep an eye on the future too – it will be here soon enough. ,capricorn,You may have to put a creative activity on hold today but you can always come back to it later. The simple fact is you have so many projects on the go at the moment that you have to focus on the most important things first. ,capricorn,You need to cut through the chaos and confusion and get to the root of a problem that has been causing not just you but many other people sleepless nights. The solution, once you find it, will be simplicity itself. Why didn’t you think of it before?,capricorn,You have been on a high of late, thanks to Mars in your sign, but as from next week you will need to be more careful how you use your time and energy. Focus only on activities that mean something to you personally. Don’t spread yourself too thin.
capricorn,You have accomplished much already this year and no doubt feel you could drive yourself to even greater heights. Maybe you could, but if you try to do it all on your own you could also fall a long way. Get help from friends and colleagues.
capricorn,Some people think you are spending too much time enjoying yourself and not enough time taking care of serious matters. Some people can go jump! You will get serious when it is time to get serious, and that time is not now.
capricorn,You may feel an overwhelming urge to do something important or dramatic but don’t get carried away. Try to stay relaxed, physically, mentally and emotionally, and wait for the right opportunity to act. Chances are it won’t be long in coming. ,capricorn,Mars may have left your birth sign but that does not mean you have to slow down. There are still a number of important tasks that need finishing, so keep at them and make sure you do the best job possible. Your standards must always be high.
capricorn,If facts and figures don’t add up today it could be because someone has been playing fast and loose with the truth. Or it could be that you have missed something out of your calculations. Check the details again before making accusations.
capricorn,As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign today you will find it easier to relax and take life as it comes. But don’t go to extremes and relax so much that you do nothing at all. Find a healthy balance between work and play.
capricorn,The upcoming full moon is putting you on edge – you can sense that something unwelcome is going to occur. Most likely you will have to rethink your commitment to something of a creative nature. Don’t worry, it won’t be too bad. ,capricorn,You are entitled to your opinions but if at some stage today you become aware that what you believe is wrong you must accept it. If you keep pushing a viewpoint that is clearly out of date it won’t do much for your reputation.
capricorn,Opportunities that have been closed to you in the past are open now and all you have to do is take advantage of them. Don’t be suspicious that things have suddenly gone from bad to good – even if there is a catch it will be worth paying. ,capricorn,You are not as cautious as some people think and will go out of your way over the next few days to show that you are actually quite adventurous. Whatever ideas, big or small, pop into your head you must follow them through to the end.
capricorn,You can sense that something special is going to happen but you don’t want to build up your hopes too far in case it all goes wrong. Never fear. What occurs over the next few days will bring you nothing but joy, so get ready to party.
capricorn,You need to get your thoughts into gear because the world you inhabit is going to be chaotic over the next few days. Make sure you have a clear picture in your mind of what it is you need to do – without it you will soon be lost.
capricorn,The most important thing now is that you make time for yourself and the only way you can do that effectively is to let others know that you do not exist to cater to their every whim. You have needs too and those needs must come first.
capricorn,You may find that you become more reclusive over the next few days – you want to spend some time on your own. This is very much a time for looking back and taking stock, so don’t force yourself to be sociable when you don’t want to be.
capricorn,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart means you must not take what you see or hear today too seriously. Chances are you are being deceived, either by someone who is jealous of your success or by your own insecurity.
capricorn,Act as if you believe in yourself, even if your head is full of doubts and fears. You may have serious doubts about your ability to change things but you must not let them show. Why? Because others are counting on you to lead the way. ,capricorn,Beware former rivals who come bearing gifts. Yes, they could be on the level but the planets warn this is no time to let down your guard, especially if there are big bucks at stake. Common sense will tell you who you can and cannot trust.
capricorn,Don’t think too much about what you are doing today because the best results will happen when you let life play you. Once you are in the groove there will be no stopping you and you will be as lucky financially as you are in love. ,capricorn,If there is something you feel you have to say then say it this weekend because the words will just flow out of you. You are sure to make a good impression, even more so if you speak plainly and make sure everyone understands you. ,capricorn,Not even a Capricorn can be brave all the time and what happens today may scare you a bit. The good news is that this particular fear is based on an illusion, one that will fade away like morning mist around the time of Tuesday’s new moon.
capricorn,You won’t be the life and soul of the party today. Find a quiet place where you can sit and contemplate the meaning of your existence and don’t even think about money or your career. Riches come from within, so look there for your success.
capricorn,A new moon in the most retiring area of your chart means you will want to be on your own. Those who know you well will give you the space you need. Those who don’t know you well will know you better by the end of the day!,capricorn,Rivals and competitors seem determined to give you a hard time – so give them a hard time back! Keep telling yourself that you have what it takes to be the best and reach the top. Self-belief is not just an option, it is essential. ,capricorn,You may think that by supporting certain causes you are doing good but today’s Sun-Neptune link will challenge that assumption is some way. It’s not enough just to do something, it must be something that really does change the world for the better. ,capricorn,It may feel as if something good is going out of your life, and maybe it is, but something new and better will replace it in a matter of days. Also, if you feel lucky you will be lucky, so always think big and always expect the best. ,capricorn,Someone will try to push their luck over the next few days but they won’t succeed. You have no intention of letting them get away with behavior they do not deserve to get away with. You always play by the rules so they must too. ,capricorn,You need to calm down a bit after the recent chaos and confusion. Once you have caught your breath you can decide if what happened was serious or, more likely, that it was all a bit of a joke. Next time, don’t get carried away so easily. ,capricorn,The more your critics say that certain things cannot be done the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Just make sure you are not being manipulated by rivals who know how to push your emotional buttons. It could be they are bluffing you.
capricorn,Changes on the work front may be unsettling but they are not as negative as you fear, so don’t overreact. Your mental state has a direct effect on your physical wellbeing, so try not to worry about things over which you have no control.
capricorn,Someone has stretched your patience to the limit and now you are determined to hit back. Which is understandable, of course, but the planets warn if you start a fight now it may not end for a very long time. Seriously, is it worth it?,capricorn,You have been a bit too generous in recent weeks and certain people have taken advantage of the situation. Now you must go right the other way and take back what belongs to you. If others don’t like it, that’s just too bad.
capricorn,If you show the world what you can do today and over the weekend it won’t be long before people in positions of power are beating a path to your door. Others expect great things of you – so isn’t it time you expected them of yourself as well?,capricorn,If your instincts tell you that what someone is saying is not the whole truth then you would be wise to give what they suggest a miss. Always, always act on what your inner voice tells you. Can you name a time when it has let you down?,capricorn,You may be a bit touchy this week but that’s okay. Yes, your confidence is low at the moment and you cannot work out why, but everything in life moves in cycles and before the end of the year you’ll be buzzing again.
capricorn,This may be a trying time for you but there are ways you can make it better. To start with you can be more optimistic about the future. The bad times won’t last forever and very soon the pendulum will swing your way again, so keep smiling.
aquarius,What is your fondest dream? What is it you would give up everything to do if the opportunity came your way? Well, get ready because the approaching new moon suggests you will soon get the chance. Make your dream a reality.
aquarius,Just because something is new-fangled or fashionable does not mean it is good. Keep that thought in mind and if you are confronted with a choice between something old and dull and something new and exciting, go for the old and dull.
aquarius,Some people react well to criticism and some people don’t and the planets warn you need to watch what you say over the next 24 hours. Not everyone appreciates your directness and honesty, especially when it hurts them personally.
aquarius,You are advised not to make any hasty decisions today. You may believe you know all the facts but the planets warn there is one little thing you have overlooked – and that one little thing could have very big consequences.
aquarius,Friendships and social activities are under excellent stars at the moment but don’t sit there waiting for other people to make things happen – get out into the world and make them happen yourself. A sense of adventure will take you a long way.  ,aquarius,There is no point complaining about a certain person’s behavior when what they are doing now is what they did yesterday and the day before that. It’s obviously in their nature, so either accept it or move away from their influence. ,aquarius,It may be easy to feel sorry for someone who has fallen on hard times but the fact is it’s largely their own fault, so don’t shed too many tears. Help them find a solution by all means but don’t let your own guilt feelings kick in.
aquarius,Whatever else you do this week do NOT give in to emotional blackmail. If others get the impression that you are easily swayed they won’t leave you alone for a moment. Get tough with them early and the next few days will be fine. ,aquarius,Try not to get excited about something that is not important today or you may miss out on something that is. There are so many distractions in your life at the moment that your brain cannot possibly keep track of them all.
aquarius,You need to bring your plans up to date. Sit down with a pen and a piece of paper and write down your top three objectives. Then map out how you are going to get from where you are now to where you want to be. Then do it.
aquarius,Whatever it is you hear today you must make an effort to read between the lines, because what is not being said is likely to be ten times more important than what is being said. Watch other people’s body language – it will tell you a lot.
aquarius,You will have to work twice as hard today to catch up with the things you should have done yesterday. However, if you knuckle down and apply yourself you may actually get ahead – and get a big reward for your efforts tomorrow.
aquarius,You will have to accept that you won’t get things all your own way, especially at work where certain individuals seem to take a delight in being unreasonable. The good news is it’s only a passing phase, so don’t blow your top.
aquarius,The cosmic omens are all in your favor this weekend and the more pressure you are under the more you will accomplish. Think big, act big and don’t let other people’s small-minded ways stop you from making your mark on the world.
aquarius,This week’s full moon will have people doing all sorts of weird and wonderful things, but if you can keep your feelings in check and think logically about what happens you will be in a position to take advantage of the situation,aquarius,The answers you seek are not that hard to find but you will surely find them quicker today if you get some assistance. And don’t make things too complicated for yourself – the simplest answers are nearly always the best.
aquarius,Today’s full moon indicates that your differences with a certain person are too wide and too strong to pretend that they do not exist. If a parting of the ways is necessary so be it. In the long-term you will both be better off for it.
aquarius,Delays of one sort or another are likely over the next 24 hours but while it may be frustrating it could also inspire you to try a different route. Ultimately all roads lead to the same destination, so stop complaining and get on with it.
aquarius,Spend as much time as you can with your friends today because you may not get so many opportunities to be sociable in the days and weeks to follow. Don’t expect anything of them, or of yourself – just go out and have fun together.
aquarius,A minor dispute could easily get out of hand today, especially if you insist that you are in the right and everyone else is wrong. You’re not the only one who is stubborn, so a standoff is likely. Someone needs to back down.
aquarius,On one level you will be the life and soul of the party this weekend, but on another your focus will turn inward and you will start asking yourself the kind of questions that no amount of partying can answer. It’s time to get serious.
aquarius,Do what you can for other people this week, especially those who are in some way less fortunate than you. No matter what your own problems may be there are millions, maybe billions, who would happily trade places with you.
aquarius,Keep your thoughts to yourself as the new week begins, even if you are the sort of Aquarius who enjoys discussing your ideas and beliefs with other people. The universe is trying to send you a message, so be quiet and listen.
aquarius,What happens today will convince you that life is good and about to get even better. The only reason your thoughts have been so negative of late is because you have allowed your emotions to blot out common sense. Time to rebalance. ,aquarius,The harder you try to figure something out the more of a headache it gives you. So stop trying. Some things don’t have an easy answer. Some things don’t have an answer at all. In the greater scheme of things does it really matter? No!,aquarius,If your present approach to a personal or professional problem is not working then clearly you need to tackle it from a different angle. Some people say you are too inflexible, too set in your ways to change. Prove them wrong.
aquarius,If someone comes to you for assistance you will go out of your way to help them. But don’t go so far that you spend all your time and energy on their problems and none on your own. And watch how much money you spend too.
aquarius,You may not be enthusiastic about a task you are being asked to perform but you need to buck up your ideas because if you go into it with a negative attitude the results will be less than pleasing. Treat it as a game – after all, that’s what life is.
aquarius,The new year is almost here and everyone is singing and dancing but make sure you set aside a few private moments for yourself. Thinking is important to you but if there is a party going on at full volume you won’t get much done.
aquarius,If a friend wants to wallow in self-pity today then let them get on with it. No matter what you say to cheer them up they are in no mood to listen, so don’t waste your breath. Maybe, perversely, it’s what makes them feel good.
aquarius,You will be easily provoked today, especially if you think someone is taking liberties at your expense. The only danger is you may get the wrong end of the stick and react to a provocation that exists nowhere but in your own mind. ,aquarius,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart will bring challenges of an emotional nature. Don’t be afraid to let others know how you feel, even if you have to raise your voice, because only then will they take you seriously.
aquarius,Take care not to say too much when talking to people you are not sure you can trust. You like to natter, it’s part of your nature, but if you say too much you could  undermine your own position. Don’t forget: knowledge is power.
aquarius,For some reason you appear to believe that you are surrounded by enemies, that the whole wide world is against you. Stop the foolish imaginings and look on the bright side for a change. Life is what you choose to make of it.
aquarius,For some strange reason you have a tendency at the moment to see the worst in every situation. Your anxiety will disappear next week but, in the meantime, keep reminding yourself that life is to be enjoyed and that it’s really all good.
aquarius,You may be incredibly ambitious but don’t be too pushy this coming week or you could make enemies of people who should be friends. Remember, the best way to help yourself is to help others first. It’s good business and good politics.
aquarius,You tend to fear the worst at this time of year, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself a bit hesitant as the new week begins. The good news is the tide is already beginning to turn and come the weekend you’ll be your old self again.
aquarius,What you have to do today may seem boring, but if you do it well, you will come to the attention of powerful people and, in the long-term, the rewards will be worth the effort many times over. Invest some time in your future. ,aquarius,You may think that someone is keeping something from you, and maybe they are, but don’t let it worry you. It’s unlikely to be bad news and it’s even possible they are planning some kind of surprise. Don’t spoil it by peeking too soon.
aquarius,You may think you can do as you please at the moment but you are kidding yourself and today’s events will bring that fact home to you sharply. There are forces operating behind the scenes that limit your options. Be aware of that fact.
aquarius,Don’t reject an idea just because it seems impractical. It may look that way at the moment but a few days from now you will see it in a different light, one that makes you realize that if you want something enough you can find a way to get it.
aquarius,Everyone seems to have an opinion about what is wrong with your life but they might as well save their breath. As far as you are concerned this is just a temporary storm and in a matter of days everything will be sunshine and light again.
aquarius,You will get the chance to help someone in need and you won’t think twice about it. However, it might be wise to make clear that you expect them to look after themselves after that. You don’t want them getting at you every day!,aquarius,Sometimes you can be too suspicious for your own good and as the Sun moves through the most secretive area of your chart you must not let the more distrustful side of your nature take control. In the long-term you’re the one who will suffer.
aquarius,You seem to be in a fighting mood at the moment but don’t lose sight of the fact that while some things are worth fighting for, other things are not. Pick your battles carefully and, most importantly, make sure your enemy is worthy.
aquarius,Today’s full moon urges you to get your head out of the clouds and focus on the facts of your current situation. You will have to tighten your belt financially over the next few weeks but it will only hurt if your attitude is wrong.
aquarius,The best way to help yourself today is to help other people. With mind planet Mercury linked nicely to your ruler Uranus you have a knack for knowing what those around you need – and will go out of your way to get it for them.
aquarius,A new phase is about to begin but before it does there is something you must get out of the way. No doubt you would prefer to ignore it, but if you do you will regret it later. Remember, it’s the little things that have the biggest impact.
aquarius,No matter how daunting the challenges you have to face you will win through with ease. The Sun moves into your birth sign on Monday and your courage and confidence will go off the scale. Look out world, Aquarius is back!,aquarius,The Sun moves into your birth sign today, heralding the start of an extremely busy and fun time in your life. The things you do over the next few weeks will determine the level of success you enjoy over the few years, so do them well.
aquarius,This is one of the most important times of the year for you and the Sun in your sign will see to it that whatever you decide to do is endowed with extra power. Aim to do good things for others and good things will come your way too.
aquarius,There may be a thousand things in this life that delight you but there is one thing only that demands your attention over the coming 12 months. You know what it is and you know why it is so important, so make a start on it today, and then just keep going.
aquarius,It does not matter that others do not believe in what you are doing – the only thing that matters is that you believe in it. The whole world could be against you now but you will still come out on top. That’s a promise from the stars.
aquarius,In the eyes of the world you can do no wrong, so be more adventurous and don’t worry if you tread on other people’s toes – most likely they will apologize to you! In every way you are moving faster than just about anyone and everyone.
aquarius,You may at times wonder if you are on the right track and making the most of your talents but you will push ahead regardless. This time next year you will look back and marvel at how far you have come – and give yourself a pat on the back for staying the course.
aquarius,A new moon in your sign in midweek indicates a new start in whatever area you think most needs to change. With Uranus, your ruler, on great form as well there will be events that both surprise and delight you. It’s all good.
aquarius,The world is yours for the taking – all you have to do is identify what it is you most want to accomplish then just get on and make it happen. Can it really be that easy? Yes it can and by this time next year chances are you will be both famous and rich.
aquarius,There is no point playing safe. On the contrary, you should seek out situations that test what you are capable of, because it is only by being tested that you will realize how much you can do – about ten times as much as you are doing right now!,aquarius,Wherever you are and whatever you happen to be doing now, you will be somewhere else doing something completely different 12 months from now. You have always wanted to travel and be unusual. You’re about to get your chance.
aquarius,Today’s new moon in your sign marks this out as the perfect time to start something new and exciting, something you always wanted to do but never before had the courage to begin. Well, now you do – so get on and make it a triumph.
aquarius,Put your own needs first over the coming year and don’t worry too much about what others are up to. Something (or someone) that has annoyed you for ages will fade from your life over the next few months and you’ll feel so much better for it.
aquarius,Something that has been an obstacle to your growth for months, maybe even years, will be removed over the next 48 hours, allowing you to move swiftly toward your goal again. If you can, help remove an obstacle for a friend as well.
aquarius,You need to be challenged, you need to be pushed, you need to be made aware that you are capable of doing so much more. And you will be. Your birthday chart indicates that the coming 12 months will stretch you – and reward you – like never before.
aquarius,If you put your mind to it today you can change something about yourself that you have disliked for a very long time. How will you do that? By replacing a bad habit with a good habit. There’s no reason a good habit can’t be fun.
aquarius,Take a good look at what is annoying or upsetting you and ask yourself how important it really is. Most likely, you will come to the conclusion that it’s not worth another minute of your time or emotional energy. So forget it. ,aquarius,So many things will change in your life over the next 12 months that you may begin to feel that upheaval is quite normal. In a way that’s good because the world is moving faster by the day and not everyone has what it takes to keep up. But you do.
aquarius,Fortune will smile on you over the coming year, but its smile will be broader and brighter if you meet it halfway and do the kind of things that will get you noticed. You possess that indefinable something which is called “star quality”. Don’t waste it.
aquarius,Wherever you go and whatever you do over the coming 12 months, your guardian angel will be watching over you, so by all means push the boundaries a little. You should not be reckless, of course, but taking calculated risks will be fun — and profitable.
aquarius,You may be sociable by nature but you must make sure you get plenty of private time, especially if you are the sort of Aquarius who is constantly trying to make sense of the world you inhabit. The deeper your thoughts the wider your understanding will be.
aquarius,Your head and your heart are working well together at the moment, but unfortunately some of the people you have to deal with are so mixed up their presence in your life is becoming a liability. So get rid of them. Be ruthless. ,aquarius,You will find your voice this year – and once you’ve found it you won’t stop talking! Get involved in the big issues of the day and make sure your point of view is out there in the marketplace of ideas. You will win a lot of arguments, and a lot of new friends.
aquarius,The bigger the challenge the more you like it. Your sense of adventure is such that you don’t mind what life throws at you – as far as you are concerned each and every problem is an opportunity for fun. Hold on to that feeling right though the year.
aquarius,Today’s full moon can either be a positive or a negative influence, depending on how you choose to react to people who annoy you. No matter what they do or say just smile and refuse to get angry. They’re really not worth the bother.
aquarius,The Sun and Mars combine on your birthday to give you all the energy and all the ambition you will ever need. However, as retrograde Mercury is also strong you must be rational in your thinking. Deal with the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.
aquarius,Be ready to change direction at a moment’s notice over the coming 12 months. Even if you are the sort who stubbornly refuses to move with the times it is in your interests to be more flexible – and more adventurous. Make the effort – you’ll enjoy it.
aquarius,For some time you have been torn between two possible futures for yourself and it’s got to the stage where being unable to decide is driving you mad. So why not embrace them both? You don’t have to commit yourself to just one way of living. Give it a go.
aquarius,What you are currently worrying about is not worth the time or the effort. A few days from now, you will look back and wonder how you could have gotten so worked up about something so trivial. Why not get wise to it now? ,aquarius,Limit your spending to essentials today. You know how easy it is to reach into your pocket and find cash for this or that trinket but if you do that now you may have nothing left for the weekend – and that’s when the fun begins!,aquarius,Just because you see things in a clear and logical way does not mean other people see with the same kind of eyes or understanding. You will encounter someone today who is rather dull-witted. You have to accept that some people will never “get it”.
aquarius,You seem to believe that there is some sort of conspiracy against you. Yes, of course, you are overreacting but even so you would be wise not to give away too much about yourself this weekend. The less others know about your activities the better.
aquarius,You like to splash out occasionally and the current cosmic set-up makes it difficult to keep your money in your pocket. Promise yourself now, before the new week begins, that you will limit yourself to a fixed amount of spending money every day.
aquarius,You need to protect what you have gained, which is considerable. Common sense tells you that your winning streak can’t last forever and that if you carry on taking risks you could lose it all. Maybe it’s time to cash in some of those chips.
aquarius,If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, no matter how many obstacles are placed in your path. Whatever challenges you face you are big enough and tough enough to deal with them – in fact they bring out the best in you.
aquarius,You want to do something for people who are in some way less well off than you. That’s very noble of you but don’t just throw your money at the first good cause that comes along. Get involved in a project that will make a lasting difference.
aquarius,You don’t take risks often but when you do you go all the way. With that thought in mind you are advised to wait until the weekend to follow up on what you are planning. If you start too early you could lose it all.
aquarius,Any self-doubts you have will start to fade today and with luck will be swept away completely by tomorrow’s new moon. Other people expect you to be confident and positive in your views and the last thing you want is to disappoint them.
aquarius,Look for new ways to improve your cash flow situation. Today’s new moon, backed up by the power of luck planet Jupiter, will inspire you to focus your money-making energies in one specific direction. The first million is always the best!,aquarius,You may have higher standards than most but don’t try to be a perfectionist. Even an Aquarius is allowed to let things slip once in a while and what happens this week will remind you that you are human, despite what some people say!,aquarius,You would do well to remember today that even an Aquarius has limits. It may feel as if you can take on the world and win, and maybe you can, but there is sure to be a downside, especially if you come on strong when you don’t have to.
aquarius,You will be a hero to some and a villain to others today – there will be no in between. Whatever it is you say that causes a fuss don’t let anyone tell you that you should have kept quiet. You have every right to speak your mind.
aquarius,There is nothing you cannot do. There is no one you cannot impress. With Venus, planet of harmony, joining Mercury in your sign today doors will open as if by magic and heads will turn as you walk down the street. You’re worth watching!,aquarius,Jupiter moves in your favor today, making it easy to break free of habits and routines that are holding you back. Remember: the best way to get rid of a habit you’ve become used to is to replace it with a better one that challenges you.
aquarius,You seem to be in two minds whether to push ahead quickly with a new plan or to hold back and see how things develop. Hopefully it will be the former as the longer you wait the more likely it is others will get ahead of you.
aquarius,Do you proceed with caution or do you act on the spur of the moment? If an opportunity arises this weekend that demands a response you must act quickly and decisively. You will surely regret it later if you hesitate now.
aquarius,No matter how complicated things seem to get over the next few days the planets indicate it is all quite simple. There is an explanation for everything that happens, so stay calm and make the best of events, be they “good” or be they “bad”.s,aquarius,You may have to force yourself to be enthusiastic about what has to be done today but it will be worth the effort. By midweek at the latest everyone will be patting you on the back and saying what a great job you’ve done.
aquarius,Changes on the work front may not be what you were hoping for but later in the year you will realize they were exactly what you needed, so don’t be too negative about them. You will be moving up in the world again before too long.
aquarius,Make a conscious effort to stand above petty battles and see the bigger picture. It may look as if the world is going to hell in a handcart but that’s only because you are taking too narrow a view of events. Look for deeper and wider meanings.
aquarius,There is always an answer, even to the most difficult of questions, so don’t lose heart if your existence isn’t easy. Despite what some people choose to believe life is, was and always will be a garden of delights. If you can’t see that – you need glasses!,aquarius,With Mercury in your sign linked to Mars your mind will move fast, so fast in fact that it may take a while for the rest of you to catch up! Be careful you don’t exhaust yourself – something that can happen to your mind as well as your body.
aquarius,Sacrifices of one sort or another will have to be made over the next few days. You will also have to accept that you are going to have less cash in your pocket for a while. But money doesn’t make you happy – right?,aquarius,If someone you live, work or do business with makes life difficult for no good reason this week don’t get uptight about it. Most likely it’s the influence of the full moon coming into play. You won’t get anywhere by being too tense or aggressive.
aquarius,Don’t let anyone pressure you into doing something you don’t feel 100 per cent happy about. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to money matters. What you own and what you earn are under serious stars, so don’t take chances.
aquarius,Today’s link between values planet Venus, currently in your sign, and your ruling planet Uranus will encourage you to believe that life is good and getting better by the minute. Your thoughts, and your feelings, create the world you experience.
aquarius,The more you are on the move over the next few days the more likely it is you will find answers to the questions you have been asking. You may not be thrilled by some of the things you learn but the truth is about facts, not feelings.
aquarius,The Sun moves in your favour today, making it easy to get your own way. Does that fill your head with ideas? It should, and each and every one of those ideas is entirely legitimate. Use your powers of persuasion to make a profit.
aquarius,You want to get on in the world, you want to make a difference in a good way, but how do you actually do that? What happens over the next 24 hours will point you in the right direction. After that, all you have to do is march!,aquarius,A social event will have to be put on the back burner while you take care of family and financial issues. The good news is that today’s Mercury-Neptune link will inspire you to spot new money-making opportunities. Keep them to yourself.
aquarius,You will feel on top of the world over the next few days, which is great, but there is a danger that because you feel so good you will do something silly, something you regret big,aquarius,Let a friend who is feeling a bit down at the moment know you are there for them. Your warm words could be all it takes to get them smiling again and one small act of kindness could have a knock-on effect that transforms their life.
aquarius,With both the Sun and Uranus moving through one of the better areas of your chart you no doubt feel ready for a new adventure. That’s great, but if you are on the move you should plan your route carefully and allow for delays and diversions.
aquarius,Mercury in the money area of your chart suggests that Lady Luck will be smiling on you over the next few days. If you do find you have extra cash in your pocket why not treat someone you love to an afternoon or evening out?,aquarius,A remark you toss out into the conversation may not be meant in a negative way but that’s how one person may take it. If they do seem offended let them know straight away that you meant no harm by it. Don’t lose a friend over something trivial.
aquarius,An investment you made a while back will pay off today and looking back you will be glad you had the sense to act on what your inner voice told you. What it’s telling you now is to keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away.
aquarius,You need to get your thoughts in order before the Sun links with Uranus, your ruler, on Thursday. To do so you may have to shut yourself away for a while so you are not distracted by noisy and annoying people – that’s just about everyone!,aquarius,If you want to convince authority figures that you know what you are talking about then you must back up your opinions with facts. If you can’t do that convincingly then maybe it would be best if you just stayed quiet today.
aquarius,There is no point getting annoyed about things that are beyond your control – you know that already. So why are you allowing what everyone agrees is a quite minor event to cause major shockwaves in your life? Get over it – now.
aquarius,Consider all the options and all the possibilities before deciding what you are going to do next. Better still, do nothing at all. Loved ones and work colleagues may be annoyed that you are dragging your feet but what can they do about it?,aquarius,The Sun at odds with power planet Pluto today warns you must resist the temptation to go to extremes. If you overstep the mark either at home or at work you could end up paying a very high price. Know your limits and stay within them.
aquarius,A light-hearted attitude will take you a long way today. The planets suggest if you take nothing too seriously then nothing too serious will go wrong. In the greater scheme of things, no matter what happens, it all comes right in the end.
aquarius,For some reason you are reluctant to take the kind of risk that at most others times you would not even think about. Maybe your subconscious is trying to protect you. Maybe it is aware of something your everyday mind is not.
aquarius,Are your instincts reliable? On most occasions they can be trusted to point you in the right direction but over the next few days they may not be quite so dependable, so think twice before taking action – then think again, just to be sure.
aquarius,You will find it much easier to get your message across today and that’s good because you have plenty to say. Your way with words will help you to persuade others that you know what you are talking about – though it doesn’t mean you do!,aquarius,The efforts you have put in over the past few months will pay off in a big way eventually, so don’t get disheartened if it seems you are not making much progress. Beneath the surface of your life a great transformation is taking shape.
aquarius,If you want a creative endeavor to be a success you are going to need help and with so much positive cosmic activity this is a good time to ask. Others want to be on your team, not least because they know it’s the one most likely to win.
aquarius,You may not get much in the way of thanks for a good deed today but that’s okay. The world would be a sad place indeed if we only ever did favors for others because we expected to get something back in return.
aquarius,The more open and outgoing you have been in recent weeks the more you need to spend some time by yourself now. This is a time both for thinking and for coming to terms with your feelings. You can’t do that at yet another party.
aquarius,Be careful what you say this weekend because your rivals will be watching and listening more carefully than usual and won’t hesitate to make you look bad if they get the chance. Above all, don’t exaggerate in any way, shape or form.
aquarius,The contacts you make over the next few days will come in useful later in the year when you need to build support for what you are planning to do. No matter how busy you are at the moment make time to be sociable.
aquarius,Be careful what you decide today because once you have made up your mind about something the planets won’t let you change back again. Remember too that while you may not be in control of events your emotions are always yours to command.
aquarius,This is still a pretty good time for you but today’s eclipse warns you need to take care, especially when socializing and traveling. If you do too much there is a danger you could exhaust yourself – and you’ll still have all those chores to finish.
aquarius,If you feel the need to go out and have a good time then do so and don’t feel in the least bit guilty about it. Put your troubles behind you and do whatever makes you feel glad to be alive. Life is supposed to be fun.
aquarius,For some unexplained reason you seem reluctant to take chances at the moment and according to the planets you are right to hold back. A lot will change over the next four or five days, so wait a bit before making your next big move.
aquarius,Although money matters and other material issues may be important that does not mean you have to focus on them to the exclusion of everything else. Man does not live by bread alone – the heart and the spirit matter too.
aquarius,You cannot possibly carry on at your current frenzied pace, so take a breather and see more of the people you love. The Sun’s move into the domestic area of your chart this weekend means family time is more important than work time.
aquarius,Your feelings will be rather intense over the next few days and anyone who expects you to be your usual sunny self may be in for a shock. That’s okay. Even an Aquarius is allowed an off day, or three, once in a while.
aquarius,You may not be in the mood to make allowances for those who think and act more slowly than you but the planets warn you don’t have much choice in the matter. Under no circumstances clash with people in positions of power. You’ll lose.
aquarius,The planets indicate that your best course of action today is to take no action at all. That might sound rather negative but with Mars and Jupiter battling it out the sensible thing to do is to keep your head down and let others take the risks.
aquarius,You will learn something to your advantage over the next 24 hours but if you are smart you will keep it to yourself for now. Knowledge is power and what you find out about a situation could be beneficial both personally and financially.
aquarius,You get on well with most people but you also need to be aware that there are individuals out there who are so different to you in temperament that it’s unlikely you will ever be friends. That’s okay – it’s what makes for such an interesting world.
aquarius,You are on a winning streak at the moment and the planets indicate it will continue into the weekend. It doesn’t have to be just about money – you will be lucky in love as well. Someone you work with thinks you’re extra special.
aquarius,There is no point getting upset about events over which you have no control. No matter what happens over the next 48 hours you must stay calm. Think of life as a contest – a contest you are more likely to win if you don’t take it too seriously.
aquarius,Issues you have been avoiding will be brought to a head this week and that’s good because it means you will finally have to deal with them. There is a real possibility of making a new start, but first you must face up to emotional issues.
aquarius,The task you are faced with today may seem daunting but if you attack it in the right way – that is, with a song in your heart and a smile on your face – there is no doubt at all you will make a success of it. You really can’t lose.
aquarius,Make sure you get the up front support of loved ones before embarking on a new course of action. Try to persuade them that what you desire for yourself will also be good for them. It would help, of course, if it was true.
aquarius,Focus on helping other people today. Everyone knows you are talented and destined to move up in the world but what they may not know is that you get a huge kick from doing good for others. For Aquarius “us” is more important than “me”.
aquarius,You appear to believe that your feelings for a certain person are a one-way street but that is far from the truth. They care as much for you as you do for them but, for the moment at least, they’ve got other things to worry about. Be patient.
aquarius,The good news is you seem to be handling challenges well and the even better news is that it won’t be long before you are rewarded in some way. Everything evens out in the end, so keep believing that the good times will return.
aquarius,Family and friends will happily help you in whatever it is you are trying to do but only if they know what you are trying to do – and that means you must tell them. You’re not a mind reader so what makes you think they are?,aquarius,It does not matter that everyone else seems to be running around at top speed you should be taking life at a much slower pace. The right opportunities will come to you at just the right time, so why exhaust yourself when you don’t have to?,aquarius,What happens over the next 24 hours will remind you that it is not where you look but how you look that determines the way the world seems to be. Be positive and purposeful in everything you say and do – and the world will reflect your attitude.
aquarius,Something is holding you back, something is stopping you from reaching your true potential. According to the planets it could be your own self-doubt that is preventing you from pushing ahead. Don’t be so negative: you’ve got what it takes.
aquarius,Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving into your fellow Air sign of Gemini the mental turmoil of the past few weeks will just fade away. Well, hopefully. You can certainly make things easier for yourself by not worrying so much.
aquarius,Don’t worry if you lose out in some way over the next 24 hours because you will more than make up for it later in the month. If something seems to be slipping from your grasp just let it go. Change is always good in the long-term.
aquarius,Make sure you have all the facts at your fingertips because it is the only way you can be certain you are not being deceived. The planets warn that unscrupulous people won’t hesitate to cheat you if they think they can get away with it.
aquarius,The planets warn there will be arguments and bad feelings to deal with over the next 48 hours. Some people may be unwilling or incapable of seeing sense but you must not allow yourself to stoop to their level. You’re better than that.
aquarius,You will get the chance to cheer up a friend or love done who has been feeling a bit down of late. A dose of your optimistic take on life is just what they need to get their act together and start looking on the bright side again.
aquarius,If you are looking for ways to make money you will come up with plenty of ideas over the next 24 hours. The only danger is you may do nothing with them. One good idea acted on is better than a dozen that just sit there.
aquarius,A difference of opinion with a friend or family member could easily get out of hand over the next 48 hours, so promise yourself now that no matter what is said you won’t overreact. Come the end of the week it will all be forgotten.
aquarius,It will be easy to get annoyed with certain people today but if you are wise you will call upon your reserves of self-control and make a virtue of being both patient and forgiving. If you do fall out with someone, forgive and forget quickly.
aquarius,Someone new will come into your life today. Is it a true love match or is it just a passing fancy? You may not know for sure until later in the year but if it’s making you smile now it can’t be all bad – so enjoy!,aquarius,You may be a bit confused about your goals at the moment but don’t worry about it — in a matter of days your mind will be clear and the way ahead will be nicely mapped out for you. Listen to, and follow, your heart.
aquarius,There are so many things you want to do but if you try to get them all done at once chances are you’ll get nowhere. The only pressure you are under is the pressure you put on yourself, so slow down and tackle one task at a time.
aquarius,Put all thoughts of fear and failure behind you and strike out in a new direction. The Sun’s entry into the most dynamic area of your chart on the 21st will give you the boost you need to get working on what you were born to do.
aquarius,Some people think you are spending too much time enjoying yourself and not enough on your chores and responsibilities. Maybe they’re right but you’re not going to change your ways. Tell them to mind their own business. Better still, ignore them.
aquarius,It may seem as if your rivals are being favored while you are being ignored but even if that is true why should it worry you? Since when have you been the sort who needs other people to help you? Carve your own path through life.
aquarius,All the worries of recent weeks will be swept away over the next 24 hours. No matter how difficult things have been for you up until now you will find new sources of energy and new ways to make your dreams come true. Enjoy life!,aquarius,You will be on inspired form over the next two or three days. The Sun in Gemini will encourage you to believe that all things are possible and that taking risks is not an option but a necessity. Life is about to get interesting!,aquarius,The dark days are behind you and everything is happiness and light. Well, okay, maybe it’s not that good – yet – but it’s now within your power to change your life in major ways. Forget about yesterday, today is the only day that matters.
aquarius,It may seem as if you don’t have a care in the world but underneath that calm exterior you are struggling with some serious questions about where your life is heading. Lighten up. It’s the journey that matters, not the destination.
aquarius,Life is full of possibilities and several of those possibilities will make an appearance in your life over the next few days. The approaching new moon will give you the confidence you need to follow your dream and make it a reality.
aquarius,You will take great strides over the next few days but where to? You have so many options open to you now but you need to choose one and stick with it. Focus your energy on a single goal and don’t stop until you reach it.
aquarius,The approaching new moon encourages you to believe that you can get away with anything. It may not be entirely true but you will act as if it is and for that reason alone you will no doubt do something amazing. You ARE amazing.
aquarius,Today’s new moon in your fellow Air sign of Gemini will inspire you to be creative and put your talents to good use. Relationships will go well too, so be assertive and dynamic and make sure others know what it is you desire.
aquarius,Sometimes you get so caught up in making a living and making your way in the world that you forget there are people who love you so much they really don’t care what you achieve. One such person will delight you today.
aquarius,With both the Sun and Mars well placed in your chart you can easily find ways to get past other people’s defenses. You can, if you choose, be subtle about it but more likely you prefer to blast your way through. It’s certainly more fun!,aquarius,You will go over the top in some way this weekend but that’s okay. The planets will protect you no matter how far you go beyond accepted norms. It’s not often you get the chance to be this adventurous, so make the most of it.
aquarius,If someone betrays your trust don’t let it make you too cynical. There are still plenty of people out there who are honest and trustworthy, so don’t think everyone is on the make and don’t shut yourself away. The world needs you.
aquarius,If you kid yourself into believing that certain things are true when they clearly are not it could lead to a costly mistake. If you must take a risk make sure you know all the facts. Don’t ignore something just because you don’t like it.
aquarius,Life seems more vibrant and exciting now and in a way that’s strange as nothing much has actually changed. What is different is your attitude: where before you were too negative now you are determined to find silver linings everywhere.
aquarius,Stand back from your petty, everyday worries and see life from a wider perspective. It may seem that the odds are stacked against you but that is an illusion brought about by too narrow a focus. Expand your horizons and embrace the world.
aquarius,The planets warn that a clash of egos could get rather heated over the next 24 hours, but the results should be positive. Hopefully it will get you thinking in new and more profitable directions. Never be too fixed in your opinions.
aquarius,Seek out people who are different in some way and don’t be afraid to show them that you are different too. With Uranus, your ruler, on excellent terms with the Sun today anything that is out of the ordinary will work in your favor.
aquarius,If you go out of your way to help people today they will go out of their way to help you later on. The universe never forgets a good deed – nor a bad one for that matter – so make the effort and make someone’s life a bit easier.
aquarius,The quicker you want to move the slower everyone around you seems to go, which is so frustrating. Sadly, there is not much you can do to change things right now, so be patient and wait for the cosmic picture to move in your favor again. ,aquarius,Someone in a position of authority is watching you closely and if they like what they see you will gain in many ways over the coming week. The one thing that may put them off is if you are too rigid in your thinking. As if!,aquarius,You may be tempted to get involved in an issue that is not your concern but if you are smart you will see it for what it is – a bundle of trouble – and give it a miss. It will work itself out in the end, with or without your input.
aquarius,Push yourself forward today and let people in positions of power know who you are and what you can do. Most likely they know already but it won’t hurt to remind them – they like people who are keen to get ahead in the world.
aquarius,Don’t let anyone tell you that you have been lucky or that you do not deserve your good fortune, because luck has nothing to do with it. The fact is you deserve every good thing now coming your way. You make your own destiny.
aquarius,The more you get out and about and socialize now the more likely it is you will learn something to your advantage. Before the day is over you will be good friends with someone who shares your beliefs, ideals and taste for adventure.
aquarius,You don’t need anyone’s permission to get on and do what motivates you the most. With both the Sun and Mars moving through dynamic areas of your chart you should act first and explain yourself, if you really have to, later on.
aquarius,For some reason you are reluctant to take chances at the moment and the planets indicate you are right to hold back. A lot of unexpected things are going to happen over the next few days, so try not to commit yourself.
aquarius,When the Sun changes signs next weekend your workload is likely to increase substantially, so the fewer things you have on the go now the better. Cut back on your commitments and take a break – no one deserves it more than you.
aquarius,It’s not like you to be negative but you seem to believe that a creative activity of some kind is no longer worth the effort. You’re wrong. Put it out of your mind for a while but don’t give up on it altogether. It will come good eventually.
aquarius,If you feel you are not being appreciated or rewarded enough in your current job or occupation then start making plans. Could you be making more of your talents elsewhere? Most likely you could, so be open to new possibilities.
aquarius,What are you waiting for? Why do you hesitate? Something is holding you back from taking risks, even small ones, and that’s a shame because the planets suggest that if you take a chance today it could pay off in a big way. Do you dare?,aquarius,Can you trust what other people tell you? No you cannot. They may not be trying to trick you as such but there is reason to believe they themselves have been deceived, so err on the side of caution and trust your own instincts first and last.
aquarius,Wave goodbye to wishful thinking and focus only on the realities of your present situation. That does not mean your dreams must be abandoned but it does mean you need to get serious about which of them stand a chance of success.
aquarius,A little caution would be no bad thing over the next two or three days, especially where relationships are concerned. You have a tendency to rush into new situations with no thought for the consequences, so keep the first aid kit handy!,aquarius,Venus, planet of harmony, moves into the most creative area of your chart today, so it’s unlikely you will want to be too serious about, well, just about anything. This is not the time to be solemn. Life is supposed to be fun.
aquarius,You may be in the mood to settle an old score but is that really sensible? Focus only on positive objectives and pretend that negative and annoying people do not exist. Then get busy on what really matters: making your first million.
aquarius,Someone you meet on your travels will become very important to you in the weeks and months to come. You will be on exactly the same wavelength mentally and emotionally – and there is even the chance that romance could blossom.
aquarius,If you make a mistake today just admit it and move on. Life is a succession of tests and the powers that guide your life do not expect you to pass every one of them, at least not first time. You’ll do much better tomorrow.
aquarius,Others may crack the whip and insist that you work harder but don’t do it. You may have plenty of time and energy at your disposal but you should be using it to further your own aims, not the aims of other people.
aquarius,This should be a productive weekend for you but there is a danger you could waste time and energy on tasks that bring no benefit to you personally. The more people ask of you the more important the word “no” becomes.
aquarius,Most things seem to be going well but there is a possibility you have drifted a bit off course. Now that mind planet Mercury is moving in your favor again it will be easy to identify where that has happened and where to make changes.
aquarius,Be forceful and dynamic and make the most of whatever new opportunities come your way. Everything will work out for the best if you believe in yourself and if you believe that the Universe is on your side. It is and always will be.
aquarius,Others will come to you for advice today – just when you wanted to be on your own with your thoughts. You are too nice a person to turn them away, so help solve their problems – and, just maybe, it may help solve a few of your own.
aquarius,Your ability to tune in to how others think and feel will bring benefits today, especially on the work front where sudden changes won’t take you as much by surprise as they do some people. Somehow, you sensed they were coming.
aquarius,Your passion for a creative project of some kind knows no bounds. There is, however, a danger that you could lose touch with reality and allow it to become all-consuming. Don’t forget to come up for air, and kisses and chocolate, occasionally.
aquarius,The quality you most need today is patience – and lots of it. Come the weekend you will be able to start doing things again but over the next 24 hours control your urge to push ahead. Starting too soon may be worse than not starting at all.
aquarius,What happens over the next 48 hours will be good for you but maybe not so good for other people. Don’t let that worry you though because the more you achieve now the more you will be able to help others later on when it matters.
aquarius,Any bad feelings you may have must be brought into the open this week. Only then will you be able to deal with them. It does not matter how bad a rift may be, your way with words will help find a solution everyone is happy with.
aquarius,Don’t give up on a relationship just because it is going through a bad patch. It is times like these that test your commitment and the planets suggest that if you hang in there the tide will turn in your favor soon enough.
aquarius,Today’s link between the Sun and your ruling planet Uranus will give you the impetus you need, if not to transform your life, at least to change those areas where you are still not happy with your performance. Don’t leave it any longer.
aquarius,The tighter you hold on to something over the next few days the more painful it will be when the full moon takes it from you at the weekend. That is the lesson you now need to learn and it applies to people as well as possessions.
aquarius,Don’t argue with people who clearly do not know what they are talking about – it’s a waste of your precious time and energy. Focus on what really matters over the next 24 hours: your work, your family and your long-term ambitions.
aquarius,The more someone criticizes you the more determined you will be to carry on with what you are doing. They should know by now that telling you not to do something will most likely result in you doing precisely that.
aquarius,If someone lets you down this weekend you must resist the urge to say something hurtful. It may seem like a big deal now but later you will look back and wonder why you allowed yourself to get so worked up about it.
aquarius,Don’t worry if a relationship has been a bit strained of late because now that Jupiter is moving into your opposite sign of Leo you can easily be friends again. Whatever differences you may have they are petty in the extreme, so ignore them.
aquarius,You don’t usually let your passions get the better of you but they will do so today. You won’t care in the slightest what other people think about what you do or say. That is, you won’t care today – tomorrow, however, you may be embarrassed!,aquarius,The world is full of people who are eager to conform but you’re not one of them and what you say and do over the next 24 hours will remind certain individuals of that fact. They won’t take you for granted again!,aquarius,If there is something you need to own up to do then do so now as Jupiter, planet of good fortune, moves into your opposite sign. Most likely you have been worrying about it for no good reason. Loved ones don’t really care.
aquarius,If you are motivated purely by greed you are unlikely to get what you desire. If, however, you are driven by a genuine desire to help other people you will succeed beyond your wildest dreams. Remember: you get out what you put in.
aquarius,A friend or family member will ask you to cover up for them in some way today and you’ll be happy to do so. But hold on. You don’t want to see them get hurt, of course, but shouldn’t they be learning from their own mistakes?,aquarius,An authority figure will ask you to work with someone you don’t get on with today and you really don’t have much choice in the matter. Make a point of being fair with them – they may not be as incompetent as you believe.
aquarius,Are you being too optimistic? Are you allowing your imagination to carry you away? Maybe you are but so what! A positive attitude is essential over the next few days, especially if you are the kind of Aquarius who tends to take life too seriously.
aquarius,Even the best of friends fall out occasionally – it’s no big deal. You will get the chance to kiss and make up later in the week and if you take it there will be no lasting harm done. Next time, try not to get so emotional.
aquarius,Be nice to those you meet and do business with today, because you are going to need their help over the next few weeks. A smile and a few kind words will go a long way towards winning important people over to your side.
aquarius,If you want to get things done over the next few days you must bring other people into your plans. If you think you can do it all on your own you are mistaken, but like-minded people will make even the hardest tasks easy for you.
aquarius,Mercury, planet of trickery, could mislead you into thinking that you have got the best of a deal when, in fact, others will profit a lot more than you. Check the small print carefully before putting pen to paper over the next 24 hours.
aquarius,Why do you put up with a certain individual’s behavior? Is it because you are too nice? Or is it because you fear a backlash if you try to get tough? Either way, the situation cannot be allowed to continue, so get on top of it.
aquarius,Don’t waste your time trying to give someone advice this week because they won’t listen. Don’t take it personally either. Some people need to make their own mistakes before they learn and perhaps that is the way it has to be.
aquarius,Yes, you are still heading in the right direction. No, your life does not need a major rethink. Focus on putting one foot in front of the other this week and, in quite a short time, you will find yourself moving closer to your goal.
aquarius,Sometimes it’s okay to put your own interests first. It’s good of you to want to help those in need but you have only so much time and energy at your disposal and you have legitimate desires too. Don’t deny yourself what you crave.
aquarius,Because the Sun makes a difficult aspect to Neptune, planet of illusion, today you must make sure that your dreams have a solid basis in reality. Flights of fancy can be fun but if your head is in the clouds you must keep your feet on the ground.
aquarius,Each time you think you are making progress someone changes the rules and it’s so frustrating! What the universe is trying to show you is that there are, in fact, no hard and fast rules at all. Make them up as you go along.
aquarius,This is an excellent time for travel and social activities, and maybe affairs of the heart as well. You will be both chatty and charming today and will make a good impression on someone you have until now worshipped from afar.
aquarius,You will be flavor of the month with just about everyone over the next 48 hours. By all means enjoy yourself but don’t get carried away and give someone the idea that they mean more to you romantically than is actually the case.
aquarius,Something important will most likely go out of your life this week but don’t worry because something even better will come in to replace it. Just how good will depend to a large extent on the attitude you choose to adopt. Be positive.
aquarius,Don’t be too hard on people whose beliefs are the opposite of your own. They are as entitled to their way of thinking and their way of doing things as you are to yours, so be tolerant and talk only about issues you can agree on.
aquarius,Fate will point you in a new direction over the next few days and if you are wise you will go with the flow. There is no need to worry because the powers that be are looking over you and will always protect you.
aquarius,The approaching full moon, which takes place in your birth sign at the weekend, is sure to upset your emotional equilibrium in some way. But it will also make you more sensitive to the needs of partners and colleagues, and that’s no bad thing.
aquarius,Be precise in what you say. If you leave your words vague no one will know what it is you are trying to communicate and, as a consequence, nothing much will get done. Don’t worry about hurting other people’s feelings – only the truth matters.
aquarius,If there is someone you want to get closer to emotionally you must not hesitate for even a moment: let them know how you feel. On the work front, too, the more you open up to other people the more they will want to do for you.
aquarius,Upheavals of one kind or another are to be expected this weekend but they won’t be too bad. They may even turn out to be good if you stay sharp and look for ways to take advantage of them. With change comes opportunity.
aquarius,You may fear the worst over a partnership issue, but do you really need to be so pessimistic about it? According to the planets this is just a passing phase and by the middle of the week you will be the best of friends again.
aquarius,Don’t waste your time doing things you do not enjoy. Even if there is a task that needs to be completed there is no point forcing yourself if your heart is not in it. What will be will be, so let fate take its course.
aquarius,Resist the urge to go to extremes when dealing with people you don’t much like or the bad feelings you create may come back at you towards the end of the week. If you really can’t stand them just stay out of their way.
aquarius,Others may be rushing here, there and everywhere but you don’t have to follow their lead. According to the planets it’s largely meaningless activity, designed to make lazy people look busy. Focus on the one thing that really matters to you.
aquarius,Anyone who thinks they can threaten you will discover just how tough a cookie you can be over the next 24 hours. Don’t worry that you might make a few enemies – that just means you are being taken seriously at last.
aquarius,You need to be assertive now. You need to let everyone know that you are not in the mood to be taken for granted. There is, of course, a danger you will go too far and upset one or two people but they’ll get over it.
aquarius,Take a break from all those restrictions you have imposed on yourself. It does not matter what obligations you think you have to take care of, you must also make time for the things you enjoy. If you’re not smiling, you’re not doing it right.
aquarius,A free spirit like you should always have a way out ready and as the people you are currently involved with look a bit dodgy you are advised not to close off your escape routes. You may have to do some backtracking this week!,aquarius,Don’t worry if a relationship seems to be on the slide because you will get the opportunity to bring it up to scratch again. Today’s Venus-Jupiter link in your opposite sign will bring out the best in you – and in other people too.
aquarius,No matter what mistakes you have made you must forgive yourself and move on. It would also be a good idea to forgive others for the mistakes they made that affected you. Grudges don’t just hold others back, they hold you back too.
aquarius,If you have to sign something today make sure you check the small print, because there could be some nasty surprises if you don’t take care. If you make a mistake now it could prove costly not only for you but for others as well.
aquarius,Whatever you think is wrong with your life it is not nearly as bad as you fear, so stop worrying and start looking for ways you can bring the smile back to your face. Try helping others – you’re especially good at that.
aquarius,Persuasion always works better than force and if you are smart this weekend you will find it quite easy to convince friends and colleagues to believe in you and – the really important bit – back their belief with some serious cash.
aquarius,Money may not be that important to you but it is always nice to have enough of the stuff to do good works and what happens over the next few days will boost your income considerably. You might even be tempted to treat yourself.
aquarius,Cosmic activity in the area of your chart that governs joint financial matters indicates that you could be on the receiving end of a windfall over the next few days. There are no certainties, of course, but if you do win you’ll no doubt win big.
aquarius,You need to make a decision and you need to make it quickly. Actually, you know what needs to be done, what you have lacked up until now is the motivation to do it. What happens over the next 24 hours will finally inspire you.
aquarius,Be careful what you say over the next 24 hours, especially when dealing with people in positions of power. You may have strong feelings about certain issues but you would be wise to keep them to yourself for the time being.
aquarius,If you try to shift the blame for something you did wrong the results could be embarrassing. Everyone makes mistakes – yes, even an Aquarius – so hold up your hand and accept that you are at fault. Come tomorrow all will be forgotten.
aquarius,You may be tempted to tear everything down and start again from scratch this weekend but is that such a good idea? It may seem to be the right thing to do now but if you are acting on impulse you will regret it next week.
aquarius,On too many occasions in recent weeks you have looked at the world through eyes that see only the bad stuff. The good news is that as from midweek, when Mercury moves in your favor, the world will be a sunnier, happier place again.
aquarius,What awaits you in the future is many times better than what you are leaving behind in the past, so be positive and, if you feel that your talents are being limited in your present environment, just move on to pastures new.
aquarius,Get out and about and extend your range of contacts. You may be an individualist by nature but there is only so much progress you can make on your own. If you want to make a serious impact, reach out to people who share your ideals.
aquarius,You may be tempted to forget about your principles and do something a bit underhand today but you are advised against it. You have a reputation for honesty and if something should go wrong you could lose it – and that’s a loss you can’t afford.
aquarius,It would appear that you have overlooked something of importance, something that could make a big difference to your future. Give it some thought and when you have found what it is make sure you make it central to your plans.
aquarius,You should be feeling a lot better about your financial prospects now that values planet Venus is moving into the wealth area of your chart. But don’t take too much for granted or you may end up spending too much – again!,aquarius,Something you see or hear over the next 48 hours will provide you with a great deal of inspiration. You have been looking for something new to do and now it seems you have found it. Your creative juices are bubbling nicely.
aquarius,You must be honest in all your dealings this week, at work, in business and especially in your private affairs. If others feel they can trust you they will open up in ways that bring only good things your way. You can’t lose.
aquarius,It seems you have overestimated the return you will get from some sort of investment and, of course, you are disappointed. But it’s not the end of the world and maybe, in the long-term, it will work in your favor.
aquarius,If you feel that you are being treated unfairly you must speak up about it – loudly. It’s a sad fact of life that those who make the biggest noise often get the biggest slice of the pie as well. Shout if you have to.
aquarius,You may not want to admit it but deep down you know that a relationship is not working out the way you had hoped. Do you try again? Or do you admit defeat and go your separate ways? Only you can decide, so give it some thought.
aquarius,You have powerful friends but for some reason you are reluctant to use them to help get you out of your current predicament. Maybe it’s because you don’t want to waste your trump cards on minor problems. You can deal with this one alone.
aquarius,If you feel a bit drained, physically, mentally and emotionally, then you must take it as a sign that you need to slow down. A short rest now will do wonders for your energy levels during the early part of next week. Start the weekend early.
aquarius,You hold firm opinions on lots of topics but sometimes you can be a bit too set in your ways and it prevents you from seeing other possibilities. If someone challenges your opinions today don’t hit back without thinking. They may have a point.
aquarius,Some of the ideas you have may be inspirational, but they won’t amount to much unless you find ways of using them. If you only ever make the world a better place in one small practical way that’s better than a thousand grandiose dreams.
aquarius,A disappointment of some sort may be hard to take but the pain will fade eventually, so don’t get too down. There are still plenty of things that inspire you, so pick one of them and throw yourself at it body, mind and soul.
aquarius,Over the next few days you should take any and every opportunity to rest, recuperate and recharge your batteries. When the Sun changes signs on the 23rd it will be all go again, but in a good way – so save yourself for then.
aquarius,However much you might fear the unknown you must confront it over the next few days, otherwise you may not be in the right frame of mind to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities coming your way. Show some courage – and act!,aquarius,The answers you seek are easily found, but only if you ask the right questions in the right way. It does not matter what other people say you should be thinking or saying or doing – you’re an Aquarius, so think, speak and act big.
aquarius,Things will really pick up for you when the Sun moves into one of the most positive areas of your chart on the 23rd. Between now and then though try to get as many chores and minor tasks as you can manage out of the way.
aquarius,You can make things easier for yourself this week by refusing to dwell on past mistakes. What’s done is done and cannot be undone and the sooner you accept that fact the sooner you will be able to move on. It won’t be long before you’re smiling again.
aquarius,A difficult time of year is drawing to a close and when the Sun moves in your favor tomorrow it will feel as if a load has been lifted from your back. If you need a vacation then start making plans. No one deserves it more than you.
aquarius,You have sacrificed a great deal in recent weeks and now you are wondering if you are going to get something back in return. Don’t worry, you will. The Sun’s change of signs today will open up a world of new possibilities. Take your pick.
aquarius,You seem to be in everyone’s good books at the moment and long may it continue. However, while it may be flattering to be so highly thought of make sure you can live up to what others expect of you. There must be substance as well as style.
aquarius,Uranus, your ruler, is brilliantly aligned with luck planet Jupiter today, so how can you possibly lose? The answer is you can’t, so decide what it is you most want to do then give it your best shot. You’ll make a huge success of it.
aquarius,It may not feel right that certain people have the power to force you in a certain direction but in a matter of days you will be glad it happened that way. It seems you lack the willpower to do what has to be done.
aquarius,Any doubts you may have about the direction your career is heading should disappear over the next few days. The fact is you are still on track to reach the goals you set yourself around this time last year. Be patient – it will happen.
aquarius,Massive changes are taking place around you and, with one or two minor exceptions, they are changes which will benefit you. With that knowledge in mind don’t be afraid to take a few chances over the next few days. You’re a winner.
aquarius,Things might be calm on the surface but your instincts tell you that behind the scenes major changes are taking place. Don’t worry. It is all part of the bigger plan, a plan that is designed to make your life more fulfilling.
aquarius,You have no end of talent but you need to add patience and hard work to the mix if you expect to be a success. The Sun in Libra will help you find ways to get the balance right and soon your name will be up in lights.
aquarius,Whatever else life may be at the moment it certainly isn’t dull. The Sun in your fellow Air sign of Libra makes even mundane events seem more exciting, so no way will you be bored – and no way will you put up with boring people.
aquarius,Everything is all right with your world at the moment, or should be. The Sun and Venus in one of the best areas of your chart means you can see the positive side, and the funny side, of most situations. Go on, have a laugh.
aquarius,You have so much good fortune in your celestial bank account. When are you going to start spending some of it? The weekend is almost here, so forget about what you have to do and do only what you want to do. Yes, you can afford it.
aquarius,You are under no illusions that a number of things in your life need to change and that the change must come from within. Some people may not understand why you need to move in a new direction, so explain it to them as best you can.
aquarius,You must take responsibility for your words and actions. Because so many people look up to you there is always the danger that you might give them the wrong impression, especially when you are in one of your rebellious moods.
aquarius,You are now in the middle of one of the most fortunate times of the year and even when things seem to go wrong they will come good in the end. With that thought in mind don’t be afraid to take a few risks. You’re unlikely to lose.
aquarius,You have every reason to laugh, sing and enjoy yourself, even though some people appear to be having it tough at the moment. You may not be able to help them directly but you can set a good example. Life doesn’t have to be gloomy!,aquarius,Trust your instincts if they lead you in a certain direction today but don’t expect other people to follow your lead without question. What is crystal clear to you may be difficult for a friend or family member to comprehend, so make allowances.
aquarius,Something you have been dreaming about for weeks, months, maybe even years is about to become a reality. Lucky you. Not everyone will be pleased with what happens over the next 24 hours, but not everyone has as much to gain from it as you.
aquarius,If you are smart you will take it easy this weekend. Why? Because there are some seriously big changes coming up and you will need all your mental, emotional and physical energy to deal with them. Others will need you on top of your game too.
aquarius,A work colleague or a business partner may not be trying to cheat you as such but neither will they race to your rescue if things go wrong. You might like to think the best of your fellow human beings but you need to be more realistic for the time being.
aquarius,Whatever else you do over the next 24 hours make sure you stay on good terms with people in positions of authority. You may be a rebel by nature but there are times when even an Aquarius must play the game and this is one of them.
aquarius,You should be wonderfully happy today, and if you are not then clearly you are doing something wrong. This is one of the best times of the year for you but it won’t last much longer, so cheer up and love your life for what it is.
aquarius,Today’s Sun-Mars link encourages you to be more outgoing, both on a one-to-one level with people you know intimately and with people you meet socially or at work. You may have plenty of friends already but a few more won’t hurt.
aquarius,You know what is and is not possible and have no intention of letting daydreams and wishful thinking lead you astray. That’s good. Other people can believe in all sorts of airy-fairy nonsense if they want but you must deal only in facts.
aquarius,There is no point complaining that things are not going the way you want them to go. Wherever you happen to be and whatever you happen to be doing at this precise moment of time is exactly right for you, so lighten up and make it work.
aquarius,Say what you have to say and don’t worry about the consequences. Friends and work colleagues may be stunned by your unexpected outburst but they will also secretly admire your passion and your determination to change things for the better. ,aquarius,Don’t listen to those who say you should be different in some way, You don’t need to play a role to make your mark. Act in a way that feels natural to you, not in a way you feel is expected of you. Be yourself – only more so!,aquarius,You don’t have to throw everything out and start again from scratch with nothing. On the contrary, what you need to make your life happier and more fulfilling is right there in front of you – you just need to use it in a more positive way.
aquarius,This is the ideal time to remind an employer or someone else in a position of authority that you are special, that you are on a different, and higher, level than most of your contemporaries. Don’t let them overlook your many talents.
aquarius,A great opportunity will arrive at just the right time, in just the right place and in just the right way over the next few days, so make sure you are ready for it. You don’t need permission to act – seize the initiative and make things happen.
aquarius,The Sun in the area of your chart that governs your social and professional reputation makes this one of the most important times of the year. Whatever goals or objectives you have it’s time to get serious about them. Now. Immediately. This very moment.
aquarius,Your mind may be full of big ideas but common sense should tell you that you cannot do everything at once, so choose an aim that excites you and focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Can it work? It can if you make it.
aquarius,What happens over the next few days may not seem like something you should be grateful for but later on you will look back and realize how fortunate you were to be forced to move in a new direction. Try not to be so set in your ways.
aquarius,Don’t let money worries detract from what promises to be an excellent week. The simple fact is there is nothing you can do to change the situation at the moment, so put it out of your mind. There’s more to life than dollars and cents.
aquarius,You must deliver on a promise you made a while ago, even if it means you have to change your plans or miss out on a social event you were looking forward to. Your reputation could nosedive if you fail to deliver.
aquarius,Try not to be so driven in your pursuit of success. Be ambitious by all means but don’t lose your sense of perspective. You of all people should know there are more important things in life than fame and fortune.
aquarius,Your mind may be bursting with big ideas but what use are they if you don’t get round to knitting them together into a coherent and workable plan? Your task for the day is to bring those big ideas down to a human level.
aquarius,It’s okay to plan for the future in general terms but don’t try to see every step of the way ahead. Not only is it impossible but it will limit your options and make you unnecessarily anxious when, inevitably, plans have to change.
aquarius,It may be wiser to pretend to agree with someone than to stir up trouble by pointing out the flaws in their argument. Even if you disagree with them in a friendly way they are unlikely to be happy about it. You really don’t need another argument.
aquarius,The planets warn you have been pushing yourself too hard and need to slow down a bit. That won’t be easy with power planet Pluto so strong at the start of the week but it can and must be done. Learn to say “no” – and mean it. ,aquarius,Certain things are going out of your life and, if you are sensible, you will speed them on their way. You of all people should know that nothing stays the same forever – and that the new is invariably more rewarding than the old. ,aquarius,You can sense that a friend is not very happy but what can you do about it? The first thing, of course, is to find out why they are so ill at ease, and the only way to do that is to ask them. Be prepared for some tears!,aquarius,You know there is something missing from you life but you are having trouble discovering exactly what it is. Maybe you should revisit beliefs that you are rejected as being “old-fashioned”. Maybe there is something to them after all.
aquarius,You may feel that you have lost control over certain aspects of your lifestyle, and maybe you have, but is it such a big deal? The fact that other people are determined to take decisions for you frees up time to pursue more interesting ambitions.
aquarius,Some sort of offer will come your way over the next 24 hours but you may seem reluctant to take advantage of it. Even if it involves more work than you feel able to handle you won’t know for certain until you give it a try. ,aquarius,Sometimes you have to take center stage when the cosmic script calls for it, and it is calling for it today. Don’t stay in the shadows: let everyone see who you are, what you believe in and what you can do – that’s just about anything!,aquarius,The tension that has been a feature of your emotional life of late will ease somewhat over the next 24 hours. Even routine tasks will seem less of a chore now you know you are not being asked to do more than your share. ,aquarius,You may be inclined to throw caution to the wind and take a gamble of some sort but the planets indicate it could go badly wrong. You don’t have to take risks to get what you need – just stick to your present course. It’s boring, but effective. ,aquarius,Have faith in your own abilities and believe that you are destined to do something special. What happens this weekend and into the early part of next week will clarify exactly what your special destiny might be, so pay attention.
aquarius,This is no time to be modest. In fact the current cosmic picture urges you to shout your talents from the rooftops, to let everyone know who you are and what you can do. The higher you aim this week, the more you will achieve.
aquarius,Under no circumstances should you push yourself beyond your natural limits today. Saturn, planet of limitation, warns if you take on too much you may end up further from your long-term goal than when you started. There’s no rush.
aquarius,A rival will try to intimidate you into doing things their way but their overly assertive attitude will annoy you and make you determined to do the opposite. Can you be sure though that it isn’t a double bluff? Maybe it’s best to do nothing at all. ,aquarius,A certain amount of caution is needed today when dealing with employers and people in positions of authority. But that does not mean you have to put up and shut up. Be subtle in your criticisms – they’re not smart enough to “get it”.
aquarius,Keep telling yourself that you will succeed, no matter how difficult the tasks ahead of you may appear to be. The Sun’s change of signs over the weekend will make it easier to get on top of things without working yourself into the ground.
aquarius,Your feelings for someone will surge from one extreme to the other over the next 48 hours. Try not to make any hasty decisions, otherwise you may find yourself having to backtrack madly later on, which could be rather embarrassing. ,aquarius,Don’t waste time on little things when there is one huge thing that needs your attention. You may think that by avoiding what appears to be an unpleasant duty you can put it off indefinitely but you can’t. Tackle it now and get it over with.
aquarius,There are plenty of reasons why it might be wise to keep your head down and stay quiet but opportunities to have your say come all too rarely and you are not going to let this one pass by. Say your piece and say it loud. ,aquarius,Although Mars and Jupiter form a somewhat tense link today it could also be a useful link. It will certainly help you deal with any difficulties quickly and efficiently. You have no intention of wasting time on trivial events or trivial people. ,aquarius,If you feel the need to express yourself forcefully today then by all means do so. You have an important message to get across and if the only way to make yourself heard is to shout then do it. You have been quiet long enough. ,aquarius,A work or financial issue may be giving you problems but if you stay calm and listen to your inner voice it will guide you to the correct solution. Find a place where you can be alone with your thoughts for an hour or two.
aquarius,There is no point dwelling on events you have no way of changing. Aquarius is supposed to be a forward-looking sign, so focus on what might be rather than on what has been. Each day is a new beginning and each day is perfect in it’s own way.
aquarius,You may not fully understand why certain changes have to occur but your inner voice tells you that everything will work out for the best. Go with the flow over the next 48 hours – there is no danger at all that you will be swept away. ,aquarius,Mars in your birth sign from Thursday onwards will endow you with the courage and the confidence you need to try something new. You may be a free thinker by nature but how often do you actually put your thoughts into effect?,aquarius,There is a job to be done and you know that you won’t be able to move on in your life until it is finished. Yes, of course, you don’t like to feel you are being coerced but according to the planets it’s for your own benefit. ,aquarius,You will have to make a choice between two equally desirable things today – and, no, you cannot have them both. Once you have decided what benefit you are going to embrace you must let go of the other one completely. ,aquarius,Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moves into your sign tomorrow, so start thinking about what you would like to change in your life because you will soon get the chance. What would you do if you knew you could not fail? So do it.
aquarius,What seems such a major issue to some people is no more than an interesting sideshow to you. You’re in one of those moods when you just can’t take anything too seriously. What will be will be, and you’re happy with that.
aquarius,You have no choice but to accept that something you have been working on is not going to be the success you envisaged. Chances are though you will be quite happy to call it a day as it frees up time for more enjoyable pursuits. ,aquarius,This should be an eventful weekend, and for all the right reasons. Creative matters are under excellent stars, so get to work on something that inspires you and trust that, when finished, it will inspire other people as well.
aquarius,Do you stick with what you know you can make a success of or do you attempt something that will stretch you talent to the limit? Only you can answer that question but the planets dourge you to be more adventurous. ,aquarius,As Jupiter begins one of its retrograde phases today you are advised not to take anything for granted. Someone you think of as a friend may be harboring a secret grudge, so don’t go giving away secrets they could use against you. ,aquarius,Today may not be the most exciting day of your life but it will be important, not least because the motives of someone you have important dealings with will at last be clear to see. Looks like you can trust them after all. ,aquarius,For someone who is usually so confident you seem strangely thin-skinned at the moment. Could it be because you realize that some of the criticisms being leveled at you are true? Why not just admit you were wrong? It’s not the end of the world. ,aquarius,If others have power over you it is only because you have given them that power – and it is always in your power to take it back. Be forceful today but don’t be emotional about it. No one is going to say “no” to you. ,aquarius,You will hear something to your advantage today but because it is something you were not supposed to know you may be reluctant to make use of it. Don’t be. If others were stupid enough to let it slip that’s their problem, not yours.
aquarius,You need to get back on good terms with someone you recently clashed with. Even if you believe the problem is largely their fault you must swallow your pride and say sorry. It’s a small price to pay for what you’ll get in return.
aquarius,Disagreements are likely over the next few days and the atmosphere could turn nasty if you take what others say too seriously or too personally. Just because someone sees things from a different perspective does not make them your enemy.
aquarius,You are determined to finish that long list of chores that has been holding you back from doing more interesting things. And that’s good because the planets indicate that the next few days are potentially some of the most creative of the year.
aquarius,The atmosphere will be a bit tense today and that could spell trouble if you are the type of person who relieves tension by spending money. Make sure you keep all your receipts – you may want to return your more extravagant purchases tomorrow!,aquarius,Your imaginative powers are at their height at the moment and over the next 24 hours your head will be all over the place, but in a nice way. Don’t dismiss an idea because it sounds too outrageous to be true. For you all things are possible. ,aquarius,Focus on something of a creative or artistic nature today, preferably something that you can do on your own. You may be sociable by nature but sometimes you need to spend time alone to get the best from your abilities. ,aquarius,If someone you have feelings for spends more time with others than they do with you today there is no need to get uptight. Yes, maybe they are trying to make you feel jealous, but it’s not as if you have not done it yourself.
aquarius,To the world at large you may appear to be your usual happy-go-lucky self but deep down you are having a few doubts. That’s okay – in fact it is perfectly natural. At this time of year you tend to be negative for no good reason. It will pass. ,aquarius,Act as if you are super-confident, even if deep down you fear the worst. Most likely you are being far too negative about your prospects, so keep smiling and keep planning and keep believing that better days will come – and they will.
aquarius,Someone you are close to emotionally is likely to do something that shocks you but you should have seen it coming. You can condemn them if you like but why not show how much they mean to you by supporting them unconditionally?,aquarius,Don’t let others pressure you into accepting an offer you have no way of knowing is right for you. According to the planets it may sound good but could mean a lot more work for little return. Money doesn’t mean everything anyway.
aquarius,Make the most of Mars in your sign to try something new and maybe take a few risks. You have always been the adventurous sort and now you are determined to show you have absolutely no fear. Take on the world and win. ,aquarius,Take time out today to stand back from what you are doing and see it from a wider and a higher perspective. How does it fit in to your long-term goals? How will it benefit not only yourself but other people too? Think about it, then act. ,aquarius,You like to be controversial but watch out you don’t push it a little too far today and annoy someone you should try to stay on good terms with. Don’t say things just because you know it will provoke a reaction. ,aquarius,Pay attention to what friends and family members say this weekend, even if their words are not entirely to your liking. You don’t always know best and it could be that if you take their advice you will save yourself some embarrassment. ,aquarius,There is no point being too assertive now because you will achieve more in the long-term if you co-operate rather than compete. Despite what some people may say it is not really a dog-eat-dog world – most people still prefer to be nice.
aquarius,Be on your guard today and take nothing for granted. Yes, it’s possible you could read too much into a perfectly normal situation but rather that than you push ahead with no thought for what could go wrong. Better safe than sorry today. ,aquarius,There have been times of late when it seemed as if Lady Luck has deserted you but don’t despair because better days are coming. Stay on good terms with those you live and work with and go out and meet as many new people as possible. ,aquarius,Anyone who approaches you with a plan they insist will make you rich and famous must be politely but firmly shown the door. You don’t need other people’s plans, you have got plenty of your own – the sort of plans that mean something.
aquarius,Whatever it is you wish for as the new year begins there is every possibility that you will get it. Your thoughts are more powerful than you realize and if you focus them on a single target it won’t be long before you reach it. ,aquarius,You don’t usually spend much time on self-analysis but today you are likely to go right the other way and shut yourself away so you can contemplate the meaning of your existence. Don’t worry, you will be back to normal soon.
aquarius,Venus, planet of balance and harmony, moves into your birth sign today, so no matter how challenging the events of the next few weeks may be you will sail through them with the greatest of ease. Always look for the simplest solution. ,aquarius,Monday’s full moon is likely to make you rather impatient, especially on the work front where others seem unable or unwilling to act as fast as you can. Maybe though it is you who needs to slow down. Ask yourself honestly: what is the rush? ,aquarius,Do something exciting over the next 24 hours, something that makes you smile. Usually you don’t have to force it but today’s full moon means it may take a little more effort than usual. As always, it’s an effort worth making.
aquarius,Anyone who tries to tell you what to do today will soon be wishing they had kept out of your way. You don’t want or need advice, you just want others to leave you alone – and if they have any sense that’s exactly what they will do. ,aquarius,You might be tempted to argue with someone whose opinions you find offensive but chances are they are deliberately trying to provoke you into overreacting. The best way to deal with such people is to pretend they do not exist. ,aquarius,Today’s Mercury-Neptune link warns you need to be careful with money, so keep your cash in your pocket no matter how much others insist this is the ideal time to spend. It may be for them but it isn’t for you.
aquarius,If someone older or wiser than you offers advice today you must listen and you must think seriously about doing what they say, because it could save you a fortune. You know a lot but you cannot possibly know it all. ,aquarius,Try not to judge people whose values you do not share. With expansive Jupiter moving through your opposite sign you should find it easy to accept that people are different, although that does not mean you have to admire them.
aquarius,Your mind is so sharp at the moment that nothing escapes its attention. Which should be useful if you are looking for ways to make money. Don’t just be the first to see new possibilities, be the first to exploit them as well. ,aquarius,Make sure you get the going rate for whatever it is you are working on at the moment. Under no circumstances sell yourself short this coming week, because the moment you do is the moment everyone starts taking advantage of you. ,aquarius,Someone who does not approve of your desire to come and go as you please will try to clip your wings today. They will only succeed if you allow them to convince you that it’s for your own good. You’re not a fool, so don’t believe it.
aquarius,By all means have fun today but don’t go too far and put your wellbeing at risk. Even an Aquarius has limits and though your mind may think you are up to it your body may not agree. Always leave a little something in reserve. ,aquarius,Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours – in fact don’t push yourself at all. Some days were made for taking it easy and the planets indicate that this is one of them. You will be busy again come the weekend. ,aquarius,Don’t feel bad about it if you gain from someone else’s loss over the next 24 hours. According to the planets it is your turn to get lucky, so take advantage of the situation and make sure what you gain is well invested.
aquarius,Annoying people will do trivial things this weekend and you may have to hold your breath and count to ten so you don’t lose your temper. Stay calm but stay focused too. Unlike them, you have important issues to deal with.
aquarius,As the Sun moves into your birth sign on Tuesday you must put all the negative things that have happened behind you and focus on a new start. Each day is a new beginning and any day can be the best day ever.
aquarius,You won’t care in the slightest what anyone thinks about you today – in fact you will be quite pleased if they think the worst! You are determined to show that you will follow your own path through life, even if no one supports you. ,aquarius,A little bit of effort will go a long way over the next 24 hours, not least because with the Sun moving into your birth sign you will be extremely positive in your outlook. All things are possible if you desire them enough. ,aquarius,Sometimes it’s okay to be suspicious and this is one of those occasions. If your sixth sense tells you to take care then you should be smart and listen to them. Yes, maybe your mind is playing tricks on you but why take the chance? ,aquarius,If you want someone to do you a favor then you are going to have to flatter them, even though you know they don’t deserve it. Some days you can speak your mind but today you should keep your real thoughts to yourself.
aquarius,You don’t have to fight to get what you need. On the contrary, you will get everything you desire over the next two or three days simply by appealing to other people’s generosity. You’re the kind of person others want to do favors for.
aquarius,Don’t try too hard to please other people over the next 48 hours. The simple fact is they should be trying to please you, seeing as you are the one with the ideas and the energy and the vision of the future that inspires. ,aquarius,Venus, planet of love, leaves your sign on Tuesday, so if you need to let someone know how you feel then tell them right now. Also, a friend’s money-making idea may sound too good to be true but look into it anyway. ,aquarius,The message of the stars this week is simple and to the point: don’t get carried away by your own enthusiasms. You will get your chance to shine – in fact you will get several – but pushing too hard could be counter-productive. ,aquarius,You will get more than one opportunity to shine today, and you could make some money too. The only danger is you could be too trusting and agree to back someone financially when there are no guarantees you will see your cash again.
aquarius,According to the planets you are wasting time and energy fantasizing about things that are never going to happen. Today’s Mercury-Uranus link demands that you bring your dreams down to earth. Not even an Aquarius can do the impossible. ,aquarius,The world is full of possibilities and each and every one of those possibilities is there for you to make use of. Others may say that certain things cannot be done but you must ignore them all and follow your dream. ,aquarius,You may feel unprepared for the challenges that are coming your way but when it’s time to act you will do so with courage and confidence. You may be a nice guy by nature but you can be decisive, even ruthless, when the need arises.
aquarius,Don’t let other people hurry you along this weekend. Keep moving ahead at your own sweet pace and everything that has to get done will get done. More importantly, it will get done correctly. Someone has to keep standards high. ,aquarius,No effort will be too much for you over the next few days. Whatever goal you have in your sights now will be reached by the end of the week. If anyone is foolish enough to stand in your way they won’t be standing for long!,aquarius,There is nothing you cannot do, no challenge you cannot handle. If you are a typical Aquarius you will seek out situations that test you to the limit over the next few days. You don’t need to prove yourself but you will do so anyway. ,aquarius,You cannot expect loved ones to help with the things you want to do today – in fact they are likely to be downright obstructive. But don’t get upset because tomorrow they will make it up to you and do whatever you ask of them. ,aquarius,You are in a determined and dynamic mood at the moment and anyone who thinks they are tough enough to take you on is making a big mistake. You know what you want and there is not the slightest doubt that you will get it.
aquarius,There are some thoughts that should always be kept to yourself. The danger today is that you could say something on the spur of the moment and get yourself in a whole load of trouble with people in positions of power. ,aquarius,You may find it hard to get along with people in positions of authority today but if you take them on you are likely to lose. There are times when it is better to back down gracefully and this is one of them.
aquarius,If you need to change certain methods or routines you can do so quite easily over the next 48 hours. But don’t make a big deal of it and don’t try to do it all in one go. Think evolution, not revolution.
aquarius,You won’t need anyone’s advice or assistance this week – you know exactly what you should be doing and when Mercury turns direct again on Wednesday you will waste no time getting on with it. Success is now within touching distance. ,aquarius,If the plans you made a month or two back don’t seem to be working out the way you intended, junk them today and start again. The sooner you start making changes the sooner your confidence will grow. You have got to be bold. ,aquarius,Someone’s dishonesty may shock you today but you only have yourself to blame. The signs have been there for quite some time but you chose to ignore them. Now the question is: what are you going to do about it? ,aquarius,Something that has gone wrong on several occasions over the past two or three weeks will start going right again as from today, which in turn will lead to a much improved outlook on your part. It’s all good.
aquarius,This is a good time for all forms of communication, and whether you pick up a pen or pick up a phone others will be delighted to hear from you. An old friend you have not talked to in a while will have some remarkable news. ,aquarius,Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is moving in your favor again your head should be full of ideas. Take the initiative and start something new but make sure it is sensible and pragmatic, something that is likely to work.
aquarius,Someone you think the world of will say or do something that disappoints you this weekend but don’t let it undermine your friendship. Let them know you are not amused but let them know too that you forgive them – this time.
aquarius,You’ve had a lot of fun in recent weeks while the Sun has been transiting your birth sign, and there is no reason why the fun should not continue after the Sun moves on in midweek. Keep track though of how much it costs you. ,aquarius,You readily come to the aid of individuals who need help but if you are serious about making a difference in the world you should join with others in some kind of social or political cause. You can do more together than you do alone. ,aquarius,Take care you don’t waste money on things you don’t really need. It’s up to you what you do with your cash, of course, but surely you can find something better to spend it on, something that brings long-term benefits to you and yours. ,aquarius,It will pay you to be friendly to everyone you meet today, even those who have not always been friendly to you in the past. Your most pressing concern now is to make some extra money, so you need to get along with people. ,aquarius,Be careful what you wish for over the next 24 hours because you may get more than you expected. You may decide later that you don’t want what you wished for after all – but you won’t be allowed to change your mind. ,aquarius,Social activities will be a lot of fun over the next few days but there will be challenges too. Someone you meet while on the move could rub you up the wrong way over something trivial but it’s really no big deal, so don’t overreact.
aquarius,You will find it ridiculously easy to get what you want this weekend – you have rarely been so persuasive. But remember that if someone does you a favor there will come a time when you have to do something for them in return.
aquarius,Chances are you will want to relax and not take life too seriously this week, so make sure your affairs are in order so you don’t have to keep checking up on them. Then you can enjoy yourself with a clear conscience. ,aquarius,Stay out of a dispute today, even if you think you can bring the two sides together. Chances are you will bring them together but it is likely to be in opposition to you! There’s only one side that matters – your own side. ,aquarius,According to the planets you are desperate to make an impression and will do just about anything to make the world sit up and take notice. But don’t break the rules or, worse, break the law. The impression must be positive, not negative.
aquarius,Don’t let money worries stop you from doing what you find enjoyable today. There are times when you should watch what you spend and times when you should splash out and have some fun – and this is one of the latter. ,aquarius,The only danger today is that you might say too much and tip off a rival about what you are up to. Be wary if they try to engage you in personal conversation as it suggests they are looking for ways to undermine your efforts.
aquarius,A friend or relative will tell you something you don’t want to hear today, not least because it involves bad things about a person you like. Most likely their motive is to drive a wedge between you. They will only succeed if you let them.
aquarius,You have to decide whether to continue with a project you have invested a lot of time and energy in or whether to ditch it and start something new. Only you can make that decision but there can be no going back, so give it some serious thought.
aquarius,If you let others do things for you this week there is a good chance they will mess it up, so get your act together and do it yourself. What you have to do may be a chore but it still has to be done, and done well. ,aquarius,You need to make your peace with someone you fell out with a week or two ago. There is no point ignoring each other, not when your lives are so closely entwined, so get over your disagreement and focus on what is important. ,aquarius,Someone wants to repay you for all the kindness you have shown. It was no big deal as far as you are concerned but it will make them feel good to do you a favor, so drop a few hints as to how they can help you.
aquarius,Yes, you can turn your dreams into realities – all you have to do is believe in yourself. With Uranus, your ruler, linked to values planet Venus today you only have to put a name to your desires to see them come true.
aquarius,You may have some amazing ideas running through your head at the moment but don’t be too eager to do anything with them. This is more a time for thinking than doing, both in your private life and in your work.
aquarius,You want to do something one way but everyone else wants to do it another way – yes, you have been here before. Just get on and do what you feel is right and most people will come round to your way of thinking.
aquarius,It may annoy you that a friend seems to be taking too deep an interest in your personal affairs but it is from the best of intentions. If you really don’t want their advice then fine, let them know, but don’t let it come between you.
aquarius,You will say something this week that sounds scandalous to those who are not used to being talked to in such an abrupt way. They will soon learn that they should only come to you for advice if they are prepared to hear the unvarnished truth.
aquarius,Your mind will have to work hard this week, so don’t do anything too strenuous physically. Having said that, you will need to take a break from your mental gymnastics once in a while and a brisk walk will help. But don’t run! ,aquarius,Do something today that takes others by surprise. It does not have to be shocking or outrageous but it does have to remind those you live, work and do business with that you should never be taken for granted – not without consequences, anyway.
aquarius,You can get almost anything you desire now. Your charm levels are such that few people will be able to deny you, no matter how outrageous some of your demands might be. It won’t be this good again for a while, so take advantage!,aquarius,You will have to re-think certain ambitions over the next two or three days. New information will come to light that makes you realize there is a lot more work involved than you imagined. But that’s okay because no one works harder than you.
aquarius,The message of the stars today is that happiness comes from wanting what you have, not having what you want. You have more than enough to satisfy your basic needs, so be thankful and look for ways to help those less fortunate than yourself. ,aquarius,You must keep your thoughts positive this weekend, even though a series of negative events makes it easy to worry. Most likely you personally have nothing to fear, so approach life in a light-hearted manner and expect the best, not the worst. ,aquarius,Someone in a position of power will make you an offer during the first half of the week but you are advised not to commit yourself to anything new until the Sun changes signs on the 20th. What’s the rush? You’re the one in demand.
aquarius,You feel remarkably confident at the moment and that’s good, but don’t go too far and say or do something that risks making an enemy of people who are way beyond you in the power stakes. You want them on your side, not against you. ,aquarius,You have been unusually quiet of late but when the Sun changes signs on the 20th you will find your voice again. You certainly don’t lack for opinions, and you will have a few more to add to them by the end of the week.
aquarius,If there is something you don’t want the world to know about you must keep it strictly to yourself – don’t let even your best friend in on the secret. Once you tell one person it won’t be long before everyone knows about it.
aquarius,You may be disappointed to discover that something of value is moving out of your life but don’t feel too sorry for yourself. The planets suggest that something even better will soon be along to fill the gap. Be ready for it.
aquarius,Now that the Sun is moving into one of the more sociable, and talkative, areas of your chart you won’t have any problems putting across your point of view. The only danger is you may say it all today and have nothing left for tomorrow. ,aquarius,The more you are on the move this weekend the more you will learn. The Sun in Aries at this time of year is good for all kinds of communication, so let others know what you are thinking and encourage them to be honest with you too. ,aquarius,You will learn something to your advantage today, but whether or not you actually make use of it remains to be seen. If you don’t then someone else will and one day you may look back and wish you had taken the risk. ,aquarius,You may be adventurous by nature but others are reluctant to take risks at the moment and if you are smart you will follow their example. Try not to expose yourself to situations that could become difficult, or even dangerous. ,aquarius,Venus in the domestic area of your chart means that family affairs will go remarkably smoothly over the next few days. If there have been any minor disputes or disagreements now is the time to sit down together and sort them out.
aquarius,You may be in a fun-loving mood at the moment but you also have serious things to consider, things that must be dealt with now. Focus all your attention and energy on them today – and tomorrow you can party with a clear conscience. ,aquarius,You may like to pretend that you are self-sufficient and don’t need assistance but you need to be honest with yourself today. If you don’t get help with what is bothering you it will get worse, so forget about your ego for a while.
aquarius,This is a good day to patch up disputes with loved ones. You will find it much easier than usual to admit that you were at least partly to blame for what went wrong – and that will make it easier for others to admit their failings as well.
aquarius,You will get the chance to do a good deed for someone this week but it is the kind of good deed that only you will know about. That warm feeling you get inside is more than enough reward – you don’t need public recognition. ,aquarius,If you don’t tell the absolute truth about yourself today you will regret it later in the week when your evasive tactics are revealed for the world to see. Why should you worry what others know about you? Put everything in the public domain.
aquarius,You may have to get tough with friends and colleagues today but if it is the only way to get things done then what choice do you have? Talk the talk, walk the walk and make sure others do their fair share as well.  ,aquarius,Don’t stick your nose in someone else’s business today unless they expressly ask you to do so. Partners and colleagues are a bit touchy at the moment, so even if your intentions are noble don’t try to run their affairs for them.
aquarius,Your confidence in your own abilities has always been high but today it will be on a different level to everyone else. The Sun’s link with Jupiter means you no longer know what the word “cannot” means. You can do anything.
aquarius,There will be times over the next few days when you feel like giving up on something but you must overcome that negativity and carry on. One big push will take you over the finishing line, so take a deep breath and get on with it.
aquarius,A difference of opinion over something trivial could escalate into a full-blown war of words and that would be a shame because this is a great time for having fun socially. Don’t take anything too seriously over the next 48 hours.
aquarius,The Sun’s link with Uranus, your ruler, on Monday means you will have plenty to say this week. And no one will be able to claim they cannot understand what it is you are trying to tell them – your message will be short and to the point!,aquarius,You are in one of your generous moods at the moment, which is nice, but make sure it is only those who deserve your largesse who get it. Hangers-on will happily enjoy themselves at your expense if you let them – so don’t let them!,aquarius,You may have a right to be angry that someone has let you down but try not to go over the top about it. The most important thing you have is your reputation for fairness and logical thinking – don’t risk it over something trivial.
aquarius,You have no option now but to accept that partners and colleagues have the upper hand. But you can plan ahead and you can look forward to a time when you are back in control. That time may be closer than you think.
aquarius,You won’t find it difficult to get what you want today but don’t forget if someone makes you a loan there will come a time when you have to pay it back. Think ahead before you risk getting yourself further in debt.
aquarius,You may be sad that something, or someone, is going out of your life but don’t shed too many tears. The good news is that once you have made a space then something, or someone, even better will come along to fill it.
aquarius,You may have been a bit cold romantically of late but with Venus moving into the most dynamic area of your chart this weekend your true feelings will come to the surface. You will leave certain people in no doubt that you love them.
aquarius,This is an excellent time to communicate your feelings, especially if you are the kind of Aquarius who values emotional self-control. You will find the right words to get your message across without running the risk of getting excitable.
aquarius,Your attitude towards a belief or opinion you had previously dismissed as ridiculous will change over the next 24 hours. Something will happen to make you wonder if maybe it was you who got it wrong. You’re not infallible after all. ,aquarius,A domestic issue that has been bugging you for some time can and must be dealt with today. The answer to the problem will appear in your mind seemingly out of nowhere and once it does don’t wait or think about it – just act.
aquarius,Venus in your fellow Air sign of Gemini will do wonders for your confidence over the next few days but with Saturn strong at the moment as well you there will still be challenges. Remember, it’s about intelligence, not brute strength.
aquarius,Don’t let anyone tell you that certain things cannot be done. What seems difficult, maybe even impossible, at this moment in time will become much easier when the Sun changes signs on Monday. Life never stands still and neither should you. ,aquarius,Let yourself go and have some fun over the next 48 hours. You have been far too self-controlled in recent weeks and it has begun to have a less than positive effect on your behavior. In a nutshell: stop taking life so seriously.
aquarius,A certain individual has annoyed you once too often and now you intend to cut them out of your life. Don’t let your tender heart change your mind yet again – be ruthless about it and make sure they know your relationship is finally over. ,aquarius,Something will grab your attention today and you will be focused on it to the exclusion of everything else. Remember though that other people exist as well. Weigh up what your actions might mean to friends and loves ones.
aquarius,Friends may know you need assistance but they won’t lift a finger to help you unless you ask them to. That may annoy you a bit but most likely it’s your own fault. They’ve been told off before for interfering in your affairs.
aquarius,You will have words with a friend today and those words may have to be harsh. The fact is they have stepped over the line and need to be reminded they have obligations that cannot be ignored. Make sure they do the right thing.
aquarius,Don’t be surprised if you feel a bit moody today, even though most things in your life appear to be going well at the moment. Come the weekend you will be back to your best: lively, loving and laughing hugely at the absurdities of life.
aquarius,You won’t be content to sit back and watch the world go by today – you will be out there doing things that get you noticed. However, make sure you get noticed for the right reasons – you don’t want the powers that be on your case. ,aquarius,You will find it easy to persuade others to see things your way this weekend: you have a way with words that few can resist. But use this talent sparingly. Think of it as finite in nature – the more you use the less you have left. ,aquarius,Be careful what you say over the next few days because your words may come across as unnecessarily harsh, even if that is not your intention. People tend to respond better to kind words and encouragement than to threats and slurs. ,aquarius,If someone promises you the world and fails to deliver today you will no doubt be angry, but you should be at least as angry with yourself as you are with them. You knew they were aiming too high and you should have told them.
aquarius,The fact that you seem to be the odd one out is not cause for concern. More than any other sign Aquarius likes to think and act against the grain – it’s what makes you special. It’s when you think and act like everyone else you need to worry.
aquarius,Your thoughts may be mainly on your work at the moment but you must not neglect matters closer to home. Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart means you must make time for those you love. Lots of time!,aquarius,It does not matter how many things have gone wrong in the past, the things that really matter will start to go right as from tomorrow when mind planet Mercury moves in your favor. Believe that life is worth living – and it will be.
aquarius,Don’t worry if your confidence has been a bit low in recent weeks because as from today you will be much more positive about your long-term prospects. It’s always a great time to be you, but now more so than ever.
aquarius,No matter how exciting colleagues and employers make something sound this weekend the planets warn you should give it a miss. If they manage to persuade you to help them out you could find yourself doing most of the work. ,aquarius,You are in no mood to play safe and that’s good because cosmic activity in the early part of the week will shake things up and, in doing so, create new opportunities. Keep your ideas simple – you don’t have to be a genius every day. ,aquarius,Don’t sit back and wait for good things to happen – get out into the world and make them happen. The fact that you feel dissatisfied with your lot means that changes need to be made, and ultimately only you can make them. ,aquarius,You will clash with someone today who is as different to you as it is possible to get. Don’t waste time trying to find some common ground between you – it does not exist – just say or do what you must and then move on.
aquarius,You may be thinking of starting something new but would it not make more sense to finish what you started a while back first? Today’s powerful Sun-Pluto link will help you knuckle down and get the job done – finally! ,aquarius,You won’t hesitate to help someone in need today but the planets warn that the tale of woe you hear is only half of the story. Be that as it may you are not the sort to let them suffer, not even if they brought it on themselves.
aquarius,You of all people should know that personal feelings should never be allowed to interfere with the facts, and the fact of the matter now is that the person who is giving you so much grief is more foolish than malicious. Don’t be too hard on them.
aquarius,You don’t have to be pushy to get ahead. You have natural charm and a wonderful ability to make people seem special and if you make use of that ability this weekend you will get everything you desire, and make others feel good as well. ,aquarius,There can be no half measures now: you must go all out to get whatever it is you desire. With Mars moving into the most dynamic area of your chart this week few will dare stand against you – and they won’t be standing for long! ,aquarius,This is an excellent time for partnerships and affairs of the heart. Let those who mean something to you know how much you respect and care for them. If you have not been emotionally expressive of late you will make up for it today. ,aquarius,All things are possible now that Mars, planet of ambition, is moving through the most decisive area of your chart. But just because all things are possible does not mean you have to try everything. Be selective in your endeavors.
aquarius,You can quite easily turn a setback into something more positive, simply by asking other people to help you out. What looks like a disaster to you may look quite different to them, so ask them what they see and act on what they tell you.
aquarius,Family and financial issues need to be dealt with fast, before they get even more tangled. The Sun’s move into your fellow Air sign of Gemini next week suggests fun times – but only if you are free of unnecessary commitments.
aquarius,With Jupiter moving through the partnership area of your chart you need only click your fingers for others to come running. What have you done to deserve being treated so well? Who knows, but make the most of it – it won’t last.
aquarius,Be careful what you say over the next 48 hours because if your words are anything less than 100 percent accurate it could cause you a lot of trouble. There is no point bending the truth, not even to spare the feelings of a friend or colleague.
aquarius,The upcoming new moon urges you to focus on home and family matters over the next few days. If there have been disputes or disagreements of any kind they can now be resolved with the minimum of fuss. Get to it. ,aquarius,If you need to resolve a crisis of some sort on the home front now is the time to bring everyone together to discuss what needs to be done. Don’t let things get overheated emotionally. Keep a cool head at all times. ,aquarius,It will pay you to keep a low profile today. Nothing bad is likely to happen if you stick your head above the parapet but the planets warn that calling attention to yourself could result in extra chores you really don’t want to do.
aquarius,One of the best times of the year is about to begin and when the Sun changes signs tomorrow there will be no stopping you. Just remember to pause and enjoy the moment once in a while. Live in the present, not the past or the future.
aquarius,The negative frame of mind you have been laboring under in recent weeks will disappear either today or tomorrow and everything will be sweetness and light again. Well, almost. You will still have to deal with one or two annoying people.
aquarius,The planets indicate you could fall for someone today or over the weekend who, to say the least, is not really suitable. Have a fling if you must but don’t expect the relationship to last – chances are it will end as quickly as it began. ,aquarius,You will find it hard to decide if your glass is half full or half empty this weekend. You are more likely to look on the bright side if you focus on the things you are going to do, rather than the things you should not have done! ,aquarius,Your mind will be full of big ideas over the next few days but are they as good as you claim they are? With mind planet Mercury moving retrograde now you are advised to be careful – don’t get carried away by your own sense of genius.
aquarius,Take it slow and easy as the new week begins. Things will generally go well for you but they will go even better if you make it a priority to patch up your differences with someone you work with. Laugh with each other, not at each other.
aquarius,Can you believe what a friend or relative says? It may sound outrageous but according to the planets they could be telling you the truth. What do your instincts tell you? Your immediate gut reaction is likely to be the right one. ,aquarius,What you fear the most is the one thing you least need to fear. You may find it hard to understand why but with mind planet Mercury moving retrograde things are sure to get jumbled up. Stay calm – it will all come right in the end.
aquarius,No matter what interesting events you have lined up for the day you will have to postpone at least one of them so you can help a friend or family member who desperately needs your assistance. You’re one of life’s good guys.
aquarius,Opinions won’t be in short supply over the next 24 hours but the only advice you need is what your conscience tells you. In other words, ignore what others say and do what you think is right – and most likely it will be.
aquarius,Is there something you have missed? According to the planets there is and while it may be just a tiny detail it could have huge repercussions, so go back over the ground you have covered and find where you made your mistake.
aquarius,Try not to worry about how others might react to what you say or do. The only thing that matters now is that you follow your dream and the best way to do that is to let your instincts guide you. Other people’s opinions don’t count. ,aquarius,You are in one of your serious moods at the moment and anyone who tries to play games today or tomorrow is likely to regret it. But don’t go too far and say things you should not or you could turn a friend into an enemy. ,aquarius,Focus on the big picture over the next 24 hours and don’t let little things annoy you. No matter what goes wrong, either in your personal life or at work, in the greater scheme of things everything is progressing exactly as it should.
aquarius,You will encounter opposition in some shape or form today and somehow you are going to have to find a way to balance your domestic responsibilities and your career ambitions. It won’t be easy but it can be done – so do it!,aquarius,You will find yourself drawn to a person who is strong and powerful and the planets indicate you are a good fit creatively. Get together to work on a project that you both find inspiring. You’ll be more than the sum of your parts.
aquarius,There is a lot you can accomplish alone but there is so much more you can accomplish if you join forces with people whose objectives mirror your own. Venus in your opposite sign will encourage you not to be such a lone wolf.
aquarius,If someone upsets you this weekend you would be wise to let the incident pass. It could be they are hoping you will react and give them an excuse to take you down a peg or two. Smile sweetly and let them know you’re unfazed. ,aquarius,If there is a change you would like to make in your life, a change you know won’t be popular with friends, loved ones and work colleagues, then make it now. There will be so much confusion this coming week that you might just get away with it.
aquarius,What does not destroy you will surely make you stronger, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and start standing up for your principles and beliefs. Your rivals may be powerful but you have right on your side, and that matters more. ,aquarius,What does not destroy you will surely make you stronger, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and start standing up for your principles and beliefs. Your rivals may be powerful but you have right on your side, and that matters more.
aquarius,Avoid making any promises until Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, turns direct tomorrow when you will have a far better chance of delivering on them. You can still be enthusiastic but don’t get carried away.
aquarius,There is no point arguing with people whose opinions are so different to your own that there is no middle ground on which you can meet. On the other hand, the world would be a boring place if everyone agreed about everything.
aquarius,You won’t hesitate to help anyone who needs assistance or guidance today. However, think twice about giving away any of your hard-earned cash because other aspects warn it is likely to be wasted on things you won’t approve of.
aquarius,There is so much excitement in the air now and with the Sun and Mars joining forces in the most dynamic area of your chart you won’t be short of chances to shine. Anyone who thinks you are too serious will be proved spectacularly wrong.
aquarius,Your workload is likely to increase during the early part of the new week but there is no need for concern. You will be able to deal with it and you will still have time left over to do the things that make you happy.
aquarius,You should find it easier to come and go as you please over the next few days. However, you still need to be sensible and stay away from places where tensions are running high. There are some areas where the people just don’t agree with you.
aquarius,A creative or artistic endeavor will go well for you thanks to a new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart, not least because any doubts and fears you had are now firmly behind you. You know you’re the best, so prove it.
aquarius,Following on from yesterday’s new moon you will be in a highly creative mood and whatever you work on over the next 24 hours will bring you a great deal of joy and a great deal of success. Follow your dream wherever it takes you.
aquarius,So many good things have happened of late that you may be inclined to believe that you will be lucky forever. You should know from past experience that is unlikely to be true. Life moves in cycles, so enjoy the highs but look out for the next low.
aquarius,How much can you accomplish in a single day? If you are a typical Aquarian you can do more in 24 hours than most people manage in 24 hours and that’s good because it will be non-stop today. Your energy levels are so high it’s not real.
aquarius,Keep things simple this weekend. If you allow yourself to get bogged down in details you will lose sight of what it is you are trying to achieve and waste time and energy trying to get back on course again. Simplicity equals success.
aquarius,Few things in life happen purely by chance and if you keep that thought in mind over the next few days you should find it easy to work out why certain things are occurring. Also, don’t ever think it is too late to change the future.
aquarius,You need to get organized and devote different parts of the day to different tasks and chores, because if you allow things to overlap you will confuse yourself and not get much done. Remember: work expands to fill the time allotted to it. ,aquarius,Because mind planet Mercury squares up to Neptune, planet of illusion, today you are strongly advised to think before you act. Do not – repeat, not – take a gamble unless you are sure it will pay off. Then, of course, it won’t be a gamble!,aquarius,If you make major changes now you may want to change back again in a few days or a few weeks and that won’t be easy. Before you do anything silly ask yourself: are things really so bad as they seem? Probably not. ,aquarius,Don’t let your pride get in the way of asking for advice or assistance today. No one expects you to be good at everything so there is no need to expect it of yourself. A little bit of honesty now could save a lot of embarrassment later on. ,aquarius,Nothing is beyond you. All things are possible. According to the planets you will make even the most difficult of tasks look easy. There is though a danger that you will take on too much and spread yourself too thin. Stay focused on your number one aim.
aquarius,Don’t push yourself too hard this weekend. The planets indicate in no uncertain terms that you should be taking it easy now. Rest assured that everything which is meant to happen will happen when the time is right. Let life come to you.
aquarius,Don’t let your suspicions get the better of you over the next few days because you will most likely overreact and say things and do things you come to regret. So what if others are talking behind your back? Since when have you cared what other people say?,aquarius,Big things won’t worry you in the slightest this week but little things are likely to annoy you a lot. The thing to remember is that the approaching full moon will tend to exaggerate the importance of what’s going on. Stay calm and carry on. ,aquarius,Someone will rub you up the wrong way and you could lose your temper in a big way. Be careful you don’t take your anger out on someone who may one day be in a position of power over you – there WILL be payback.
aquarius,This is potentially a great day for affairs of the heart, but you have got to be positive and you have got to be decisive. Don’t sit there hoping that the object of your affection will come to you, get up and approach them first.
aquarius,Don’t waste time solving other people’s problems this weekend because you have a few of your own you should be dealing with. Mars in the work area of your chart will give you the get-up-and-go you need to get things done. ,aquarius,If you have overdone it recently then you must now slow down before you burn yourself out. You don’t have to stop completely but you do have to cut back on your workload and get plenty of rest. You can’t keep up this pace forever.
aquarius,No matter how persuasive you happen to be and no matter how logical your arguments may be, almost certainly friends and colleagues will oppose what you want to do today. But you should do it anyway. You don’t need their assistance. ,aquarius,One-to-one relationships, both at home and at work, are going very well for you now and if you are smart you will make the most of it. In all situations you will know just what to say or do to get the outcome you require. ,aquarius,Something in your life is clearly not working and needs to be changed but you find it difficult to admit that fact to yourself. Mercury, planet of the mind, changes signs today and that’s good because it will help you change your mind too.
aquarius,Be wary of anyone whose attitude towards you goes from one extreme to the other over the next 24 hours. If they are that changeable in their affections then maybe it’s best to keep them at arm’s length, at least for a while.
aquarius,You may be tempted to lay down the law to someone who has done a poor job or in some other way let you down but is that really the best approach? Find out why they failed when they should have succeeded. Maybe they need help.
aquarius,Let where you are going, not where you are coming from, be your guide. What’s done is done and cannot be undone, so forget the past and think only of the future. The choices you make this weekend will influence your life for years to come.
aquarius,You must speak your mind this week, no matter how much you might shock and offend. What you have to say may be hugely controversial but so what? If free speech means anything it means the right to say what you please.
aquarius,The harder you work the more work there seems still to do but don’t let it worry you because you will get there in the end. Keep moving along at a steady pace and in a matter of days you will be on top of it all.
aquarius,You must spend some time planning what you are going to do. If you don’t look ahead at the steps you will have to take there is a chance you will stray off course, and that could be costly in terms of both time and money.
aquarius,You may be tempted to crawl back into your shell and pretend that the world outside does not exist but you won’t do it. You are smart enough to know that ignoring your problems will only make them worse. Get out there and fight. ,aquarius,You must be pragmatic and deal with each situation as it arises and on its own terms. There is no point complaining about those who are dragging their feet or doing things the wrong way – that will encourage them to do it still more.
aquarius,One day soon you will look back and laugh at the things you allowed yourself to get worked up about. That day will come quicker if you refuse to give in to the emotional side of your nature, because it lets others manipulate your feelings. ,aquarius,You will be made the proverbial offer you cannot refuse this weekend. Is it on the level? Can you trust the person making it? Yes and yes again are the answers to those questions, so don’t hesitate: take what is on offer before someone else does.
aquarius,There appear to be a lot of small but annoying obstacles blocking your path at the moment but come the latter part of the week any and all obstructions will be swept away. Affairs of the heart will be even more fun than usual, especially next weekend. ,aquarius,The Sun moves into your opposite sign this week, making it a good time to look back over the past six months and see how far you have come. It’s likely to be further than you imagined. You’re not just doing well, you’re doing great! ,aquarius,Don’t be afraid to put across your point of view, even if it is seriously at odds with what majority opinion believes. It’s not about quantity, it’s about quality, and your arguments are on a much higher level than most. ,aquarius,You will find it so much easier to put your thoughts into words when Mercury moves into your opposite sign tomorrow. In all one-to-one relationships, be they romantic or professional, your head must rule your heart – no exceptions.
aquarius,If you want to succeed then you must co-operate more. Stop looking for ways you can put one over on your rivals and start looking for ways you can help each other to thrive. There is safety in numbers, and profit too. ,aquarius,Consider your options carefully, then act quickly and decisively. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to matters of a financial nature. Is an offer too good to be true? Maybe, or maybe it could be even better.
aquarius,Consider your options carefully, then act quickly and decisively. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to matters of a financial nature. Is an offer too good to be true? Maybe, or maybe it could be even better.
aquarius,Common sense should tell you that you cannot keep up your current frenetic pace for much longer. In fact, with your ruler Uranus beginning one of its retrograde phases if you don’t slow down soon something could bring you down. ,aquarius,What goes right today will be wonderful and what goes wrong won’t hurt you in the slightest. With Neptune, planet of inspiration, strong in your chart at the moment you will know instinctively if a gamble is worth taking – and most will be.
aquarius,Certain people may not deserve your support but you will give it anyway. Maybe you can sense that later in the week, when the moon is full in your sign, it is you who will need assistance. Think of good deeds as an investment.
aquarius,Friday’s full moon in your sign could herald a new beginning, but only if you are ready to let go of the past. Remember too that only one individual is responsible for what happens in your life and that individual is you. Take control. ,aquarius,The time has come to end some kind of partnership. It won’t be easy but you know it must be done and the planets will help you find the right words and the right approach. In the long-term it will be good for you both.
aquarius,The full moon in your sign urges you to make a name for yourself. Get yourself in the right frame of mind, then do something that others say is impossible. It’s the kind of challenge that brings out the best in you.
aquarius,Your emotions run deeper than most people realize and over the course of the weekend there is a danger that you will disguise your feelings to such an extent that you come across as a bit of a cold fish. Stop taking life so seriously.
aquarius,Your power to change things may be limited, which makes you angry and frustrated, but you are getting yourself worked up for no good reason. Do you really need to change that much? Maybe it is only your perspective that is wrong?,aquarius,Be realistic about what you can hope to achieve but don’t give up on your dreams just yet because you realize it is going to be tougher than you expected. Always look on the bright side but always stay in touch with reality too. ,aquarius,No matter how many upheavals there have been in your life what happens today will put everything in perspective and put the smile back on your face. The fact is you have precious little to worry about. In the greater scheme of things you’re flying.
aquarius,You may have missed out on a chance to move up in the world but don’t worry because there will be more opportunities in the near future. People in positions of power want you to impress them, so choose your moment and make an impact.
aquarius,Your doubts about certain relationships will be laid to rest today. Loved ones will go out of their way to put you at ease and reassure you that you are always in their hearts and thoughts, no matter how far apart you may be.
aquarius,Strive to stay on good terms with partners and colleagues today because if you fall out it may be a long time before you get the chance to patch things up. Yes, they can be rather annoying at times but it’s up to you how you choose to react.
aquarius,Relationship problems will come to a head this weekend but that’s good because it is time to deal with them and then move on. If someone says or does something that annoys you, don’t avoid the issue. A bit of confrontation is what you need.
aquarius,Make whatever decisions you feel most comfortable with this week and don’t worry too much that others may not approve. The only thing that matters is that you follow your instincts and act decisively when the opportunity to do so arises. ,aquarius,Don’t let financial worries limit your horizons. You may think that you cannot afford to go out and have fun but you can if you use your imagination. Jupiter’s change of signs tomorrow will bring something good you had not expected.
aquarius,You need to admit to yourself that you have taken a turning that you did not intend. Then you need to go back and do something about it. Unless, of course, you are enjoying this unexpected diversion, in which case . . . carry on.
aquarius,You have so many options to choose from now it may be a bit confusing. You are strongly advised to go with the option that provides you with the greatest amount of freedom, even though it may not be so financially rewarding. ,aquarius,Your patience may be wearing thin with a certain individual but don’t lose your temper. It could be the case that they have serious problems of their own to deal with, problems they are trying to hide behind a brave face.
aquarius,Partners and colleagues seem determined to focus on your bad points rather than your good points but you must not let it provoke you. Chances are they want to start a fight because they think it will benefit them. You don’t have to play that game.
aquarius,It may at times feel as if the world is against you but over the next 48 hours the opposite will occur: it will feel as if everyone is for you. Can you believe everything you hear? Probably not, but you’re not the sort to be easily fooled. ,aquarius,If you need to make some money then you will surely get the chance over the coming week. Don’t think for a moment that by putting financial matters first you are betraying your principles – even an Aquarius has to pay the bills. ,aquarius,Do everything in your power to get along with partners, colleagues and employers today. That does not mean you have to be a doormat but you do have to be willing to compromise more, even if it means you get slightly less while they get slightly more.
aquarius,Everything you say and do affects the world around you and if you bear that thought in mind today you will influence events far beyond your immediate environment. Whether that is for “good” or for “bad” remains to be seen.
aquarius,Just when everything was beginning to go right your plans have been thrown into confusion again. It may be immensely frustrating but don’t get angry with people who let you down because chances are they are victims too. Grin and bear it.
aquarius,You are holding on too tightly and strangling the life out of a situation that needs a lighter touch. Your main aim today must be to convince yourself that you don’t have to be master of all you survey. You only have to master yourself. ,aquarius,Say what you mean and mean what you say today and don’t worry in the slightest if certain people don’t like it. Yes, there may be a backlash of some sort, but you are big enough and tough enough to ride out the storm. Don’t back down.
aquarius,Timing is everything and according to the planets the right time to tackle money matters and business issues is now while the planets make it easy for you to get your way. You are strongly advised to pay all your debts and collect all you are owed.
aquarius,You need to keep all channels of communication open over the next few days, not least because misunderstandings are sure to occur and they will only be resolved by talking things through plainly and honestly. Make more of an effort to be sociable.
aquarius,You may be under pressure to get one task finished so you can start on another but you would be unwise to rush. If you make a mistake you will have to go back to the beginning and start all over again, so take your time and get it right. ,aquarius,Try to be a bit more laid-back about money matters today – but not so laid-back that it seems as if you no longer care. If you have any bright ideas about how to increase profits you must speak up and let partners and colleagues know.
aquarius,Do you spend more quality time with family and friends or do you focus on making a name for yourself on the work front? Only you can decide but don’t think it has to be one or the other. With a bit of planning it can be both. ,aquarius,You seem to be doing a lot of self-analysis of late. You keep asking yourself why you allowed yourself to feel the way you did about issues that you know are of no real importance. Whatever the reason, let it go – don’t torture yourself. ,aquarius,Some things matter and some things don’t and the planets warn there is a danger that you could get fixated on something that in the greater scheme of things is of only minor importance. Strive to keep things in perspective today.
aquarius,You are trying too hard to be a success. You are trying too hard to be better than your rivals. Your only task this weekend should be to relax and let life come to you. Just do what feels right and your name will soon be up in lights.
aquarius,There is someone you want to know better but because you fear rejection you don’t want to make the first approach. According to the planets there is every chance they feel the same way about you, so be brave and flirt a bit. ,aquarius,Someone in your social circle has been taking a lot of liberties of late and now it is time to let them know that enough is enough. Will it put your friendship at risk? Maybe, but rather that than they keep using you as a doormat. ,aquarius,The planets suggest that you will come out ahead in most things but that does not mean you have to do everything. Choose your tasks carefully and know when to call it a day. What you don’t do may be as important as what you do do.
aquarius,What you have to do today may be important but what really matters is the way in which you choose to do it. Act as if you have no doubts. Once others see your confident air they will respect you and do whatever you ask of them.
aquarius,You are taking certain things too seriously and need to look at life from a more detached point of view. Then you will see that some of the things you have allowed yourself to get worked up about are simply not worth the bother.
aquarius,Cosmic activity in the wealth area of your chart means you need to tighten your belt now so you can enjoy the benefits later on. The good news is that the less you spend today the more cash will be available to spend tomorrow.
aquarius,You will be compelled to act this weekend, even though you don’t want to. In the short-term you will be annoyed that you had to dance to someone else’s tune but in the long-term you will be glad you were forced to follow a new course.
aquarius,As love planet Venus moves in your favor again over the next few days affairs of the heart will bring you a great deal of joy. But don’t spread your affections too thin. Save them for those who deserve them, not those you want to impress. ,aquarius,You must fight the urge to spend your way out of trouble. Your resources are stretched enough as it is – if you start throwing your cash around you will only make matters worse in the long-term. What you need most can be had for free.
aquarius,You seem to be on the receiving end of other people’s criticisms quite a lot of late. There is not much you can do about it but ride out the storm – and look forward to the time when you can point out that you were right and they were wrong. ,aquarius,You may be tempted to speak harshly about someone today, especially if they have been saying harsh things about you, but the planets suggest you will hurt them more if you ignore them. Pretend they don’t exist. Living well is the best revenge. ,aquarius,The most important thing over the next few days is that you face up to what you fear the most. Trying to ignore what scares you won’t work, so look it in the eye and refuse to be intimidated. Soon you will realize just how powerless it is.
aquarius,Some of the things that happen over the next few days may be hard to understand but be assured there is a reason for them, so play along and don’t doubt for a moment that everything will come right in the end. Somehow it always does. ,aquarius,You may be tempted to bet against the odds but it is unlikely that you will come out ahead, so keep your money in your pocket. If you are thinking of starting a new business venture it is essential that you commit yourself for the long-term.
aquarius,You will be in an extremely dominant mood over the next few days. Yes, you are entitled to do your own thing, in your own way, but you are not entitled to expect others to follow your lead. Some people just don’t like being told.
aquarius,Try not to be too judgmental of people whose beliefs and lifestyles differ so much from your own. Yes, maybe the world would be a better place if everyone was just like you but that isn’t going to happen, so get over it.
aquarius,A disappointment of some sort may be hard to take but the pain will fade eventually, so don’t get too down. There are still plenty of things that inspire you, so pick one of them and throw yourself at it body, mind and soul. ,aquarius,Over the next few days you should take any and every opportunity to rest, recuperate and recharge your batteries. When the Sun changes signs on the 23rd it will be all go again, but in a good way – so save yourself for then.
aquarius,The answers you seek are easily found, but only if you ask the right questions in the right way. It does not matter what other people say you should be thinking or saying or doing – you’re an Aquarius, so think, speak and act big.
aquarius,Things will really pick up for you when the Sun moves into one of the most positive areas of your chart on the 23rd. Between now and then though try to get as many chores and minor tasks as you can manage out of the way.
aquarius,You can make things easier for yourself this week by refusing to dwell on past mistakes. What’s done is done and cannot be undone and the sooner you accept that fact the sooner you will be able to move on. It won’t be long before you’re smiling again.
aquarius,Your best course of action now is to be as open and honest as you possibly can be, even if your first instinct is to clam up completely and keep what you know to yourself. What have you got to worry about? You’ve done nothing wrong. ,aquarius,The harder you try to change things the more stubbornly they stay the same, so take the hint and leave well alone. If you swap things around too quickly you may later wish you had not been so hasty, so take your time and get it right.
aquarius,You are under no obligation to explain your actions to anyone, no matter what their position may be. You are who you are and you do what you do and if that isn’t good enough for them then too bad. No one commands an Aquarius. ,aquarius,The planets suggest that something is about to happen that forces you to question your view of the world, especially if that view is ultra rational and materialistic. Don’t fight against it. Let it happen. The world is a stranger place than you know.
aquarius,If you make a mistake today it is sure to be a big one. Don’t try to cover it up or shift the blame on to somebody else as that will make matters worse. Everyone gets it wrong now and again, even an Aquarius. It’s no big deal.
aquarius,You will need to do some serious thinking over the next few days about where you are going and what you are doing. Monday’s lunar eclipse in the mind area of your chart will narrow your focus and make it easy to decide what needs to be done. ,aquarius,Travel opportunities and social invitations will come thick and fast over the next few days and you will have a lot of fun while on the move with friends. You can always squeeze a bit more enjoyment out of life if you try.
aquarius,You may be hugely enthusiastic about what you are working on but in a perverse sort of way it could count against you, especially if it tempts you to take on too many tasks. People won’t be amused if you fail to deliver what you promised.
aquarius,You are about to be made an offer you won’t want to refuse but your suspicions could easily get the better of you and cause you to hold back. If so you are likely to regret it before the end of the year. Be bold.
aquarius,It does not matter if you know you are in the right, the fact is you don’t have your hands on the levers of power and that means you need to be careful. Don’t pick fights with people you know you can’t beat — it’s not brave, it’s stupid. ,aquarius,Try not to let others know too much about what you are doing. You may want to believe that everyone is a friend but that is naive. Knowledge is power and the more knowledge you give away the less power you have for yourself.
aquarius,It is important that you end the week in a positive frame of mind because then you will accomplish great things over the weekend. Remember, it’s not what happens that matters so much – it’s the way you choose to react to what happens.
aquarius,You won’t be content with the same old answers: you want to know what is really going on. Start by opening your eyes and by taking the opposite view to whatever the so-called experts tell you. Most of them don’t have a clue.
aquarius,You need to focus on your long-term financial security. What you start this coming week could pay large dividends, so don’t be afraid to get involved and don’t think for a moment that you won’t enjoy the good things in life. You will.
aquarius,If a friend or colleague proposes that you do something different don’t dismiss the idea out of hand. If you are too cautious now you may kick yourself later in the week when you are standing still while others are moving ahead fast.
aquarius,The harder you work the more there seems still to be done. Does that describe your current situation? If so you should take the hint and slow down a bit – or even a lot. Whatever deadlines you are working to are unnecessary and should be ignored. ,aquarius,You need to let certain people know that you no longer care what they say or what they do. That might sound a bit extreme but if you don’t do it now they will keep annoying you and make an even bigger falling-out more likely later on. ,aquarius,Over the next few days you will find yourself thinking deeply about the Big questions of life: the Where, When, Who, What and How type of questions that most people tend to ignore. Does life have meaning? If so, what is it? ,aquarius,Nothing truly happens by chance and if you keep that thought in mind today and over the weekend you will find it easier to deal with events. It may seem as if you are being forced in a direction you don’t want to go but go anyway. ,aquarius,Reach out and make contact with someone in a position of authority. They may not be able to do much for you now but later in the month they will remember how eager you were and offer you a chance to move up in the world. ,aquarius,You will have to deal with some rather unusual people and you will quite enjoy the experience. Maybe it’s because opposites attract or maybe it’s because you admire the fact that they are deliberately different. Either way, an interesting week. ,aquarius,New information will come to light that forces you to reconsider the way you look at the world. It won’t be too traumatic, in fact it may even be enjoyable, so don’t try to evade what it tells you – it’s all for your benefit.
aquarius,Yesterday’s Sun-Uranus link broke up something that once seemed so solid and stable and today’s new moon will show you what is going to replace it. Chances are you will be delighted with this new state of affairs. This change is good for you. ,aquarius,Employers and other authority figures will look on you kindly today and encourage you to make more of your talents. Don’t be too modest to take center stage, because you will find that being in the spotlight actually feels good. ,aquarius,You may not change the way you do things often but once you do you go all the way and that’s what will happen today. Once you try something new you will be amazed how quickly it becomes an accepted part of your life.
aquarius,Any doubts you had about what you should be doing with your life will completely disappear today and over the weekend. Keep telling yourself that you are who you are for a reason and keep listening to your inner voice. Let it guide you.
aquarius,Don’t make any rash decisions about money matters over the next 48 hours. No matter how confident you may be it’s unlikely you will be thinking clearly, so keep your money in your pocket, at least until the start of next week. ,aquarius,As the Sun approaches the career area of your chart over the next few days you will want to prove yourself to those in positions of power. The thing they most want to know, of course, is if you are ready to shoulder more responsibility. ,aquarius,What is it that you really want? The message of the stars today is that you will never be truly happy unless you do your own thing, but first you must be clear in your mind exactly what that is. Think deeply about your life – then act.
aquarius,The most important thing today is that you control your temper, no matter how much others may try to provoke you. The best way to keep your cool is to keep reminding yourself what could be at stake in the long-term – your professional status.
aquarius,Keep things simple today, both at home and at work, and don’t look for difficult answers when easy answers will do. Sometimes you can tie yourself in knots trying to understand things that cannot be understood, at least not by rational people. ,aquarius,This is no time to be cautious. Don’t sit back waiting for opportunities to come to you: get up and get into the world and make things happen. With your persuasive talents you can easily get people in positions of power to favor you. ,aquarius,There can be no half measures today, or over the next few weeks. Both in your personal life and in your work you are determined to get ahead and will do whatever it takes to realize your ambitions. Aim high – then go higher still.
aquarius,Both at home and at work you will act in ways that are completely out of character over the next 48 hours, but no harm will come of it. Take nothing too seriously and nothing too serious is likely to happen, at least not to you.
aquarius,There will be some tension between your professional life and your private life over the next few days. There is no point trying to reach a compromise because others are not in the mood to give ground. Just choose a course and stick with it.
aquarius,A change of some kind is clearly necessary and although it won’t be easy to make you know it must be done. Don’t feel bad that others are not as committed to change as you are. In the long-term it will be good for them too. ,aquarius,You must play by the rules today, because what happens later in the week will not be pleasant if important people discover that you have been cutting corners. You really don’t need to cheat – just play the game and you are sure to win. ,aquarius,The Sun in Scorpio at this time of year can either make or break your reputation, depending on how focused and hard-working you choose to be. There will be plenty of time for fun and games later – for now you need to get serious. ,aquarius,The Sun in the career area of your chart will make it easier for you to take center stage. But once you have made a good impression with the public you must keep it going. It is not enough to be a star just for a day or two.
aquarius,What you are offered today may be tempting but are the likely returns worth the time and the energy you will have to put in? If the answer is in doubt it might be wise to pass up the offer. There will be plenty of others.
aquarius,You have been a bit too free and easy with your cash of late and now you must tighten up and make sure that the money coming in covers the money that is going out. If you don’t, a day of financial reckoning won’t be far away. ,aquarius,What happens next will make you realize that you have been taking too much for granted. Recent successes have done wonders for your confidence but you also need to be aware of your limits. You are good but you are not invincible. ,aquarius,It may seem as if you are losing ground to your rivals but it isn’t true, so don’t panic. Cosmic activity in one of the more confrontational areas of your chart is making things look worse than they actually are, so stay calm and relaxed.
aquarius,Keep telling yourself that there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Of course, it is easier to say that than to actually believe it, but if you face each challenge calmly you may be surprised by how easily you cope.
aquarius,You are entitled to your opinions and you are entitled to express them in any way you see fit. If freedom means anything it means the right to disagree, for whatever reason, and the right to be heard. Just remember it works both ways.
aquarius,Be on your guard today and don’t take what others tell you at face value. There may be no logical reason why you should be suspicious but on a deeper level you seem to know that all is not as it seems. Above all, don’t commit yourself.
aquarius,Put yourself about today, socially and professionally, and get yourself noticed. If you are a typical Aquarius you don’t really care what other people think of you but it’s in your interests now to at least look as if you do.
aquarius,What happens over the next 48 hours will shake you up a bit and that’s good because things were beginning to get a bit too cozy and settled. Everyone needs to be challenged, so don’t complain if life suddenly gets tougher – it’s what you need. ,aquarius,It is important that you do not allow your standards to slip. Powerful people are watching you closely and if you cut corners or leave things undone they won’t be impressed. Make an effort and make it a bigger and better effort than before.
aquarius,Something of a creative nature that you have been working on will hit a wall today or tomorrow and you may be tempted to give up on it. That would be a big mistake. If you stick it out you will eventually find a way through.
aquarius,Lady Luck will come knocking over the next 48 hours and you should grab what she has to offer with both hands. You may be tempted to wait a while for an even better deal but if it doesn’t come you will hate yourself. Go for it now.
aquarius,Your destiny is in your own hands now and it is entirely up to you which direction you choose to travel. That does not mean you should not listen to advice from those who are more experienced than you but, ultimately, only you can decide. ,aquarius,The only thing that can hold you back is if you put a limit on your imagination – so don’t. If you can dream it you can be it and with Mars in Libra between now and the end of the year those dreams will soon be realities.
aquarius,You have put up with a lot in recent weeks and although there were times when you almost gave up you kept battling on – and very soon you will get your reward. Always believe that better days are around the next corner.
aquarius,Sometimes you can be a bit too outspoken for your own good and such a time is now. The planets warn there is a danger that someone will lure you into saying too much about feelings it might be wise to keep to yourself. ,aquarius,Anyone who tries to give you advice will regret it – you don’t want to be told. You are, of course, entitled to take that attitude but you will have only yourself to blame if you get it wrong. Try not to be quite so sure of yourself.
aquarius,No matter how impatient you may be to get started on a new project you are advised to wait a while and to double check each and every detail. Neptune’s influence could make you rather careless over the next few days, so take nothing for granted.
aquarius,All routes lead to your ultimate destination, so don’t think you have to change direction if you are not making as much progress as you would like. Remember, it’s not where you go but what you learn about yourself on the journey that matters.
aquarius,It may annoy you that some people are stuck in their own way of seeing things and that logic and common sense seem alien to them, but that’s life. Make allowances for those who do not share your ability to see both sides of the story.
aquarius,The planets warn that if you let your feelings get the better of you over the next 24 hours it will cause more than a few problems further down the line. Aquarius is one of the zodiac’s Air signs – so aim to put logic ahead of emotion. ,aquarius,You may be a recluse by nature but you need to get engaged with the world over the next few days. If you approach someone in a position of power with a request there is every chance it will be granted, so what are you waiting for?,aquarius,This is a great time to start something new, especially if it is something you do with friends or colleagues who share your values and goals. It is also a good time to impress employers and other important people with your ideas about how things can be improved.
aquarius,If you are at a loss as to what to do with yourself, get together with some friends and get involved in an activity that means something to you all. The Sun in Sagittarius is good for group activities of all kinds but especially those which help other people.
aquarius,What happens today will remind you that in the greater scheme of things material matters are of secondary importance. What gives life it’s real value is how you relate to other people. Try to see the best in everyone – it’s there if you look hard enough.
aquarius,This is potentially one of the best times of the year for you and if you want to make a name for yourself it won’t be too difficult. Today’s Mars-Saturn link will bring out your ambitious side. You’re on your way to the top. ,aquarius,If you have an urge to meddle in other people’s affairs you must resist. The planets warn that even if you are successful in changing things you will have to change them back again later and it will cost you time, energy and maybe money too. ,aquarius,You will do something today that turns heads and gets tongues wagging – and you will love every moment of it. Just make sure you don’t neglect friends and family members who have stood by you during the bad times. Give them some attention too.
aquarius,You need to bring problems and worries into the open where they can be discussed and dealt with. So long as you don’t go looking to blame other people for what has gone wrong you will find it easy to reach a compromise that everyone is happy with. ,aquarius,This weekend’s Sun-Neptune link may be a bit frustrating in that it holds you back from doing what you desire. But maybe that is no bad thing. Maybe you are not meant to move in that direction just yet. Try not to be so rigid in your thinking. ,aquarius,You should be making plans now, and the bigger they are the better. It may be a while before you can put your ideas into effect but don’t get impatient – the more you look ahead now the more successful you will be later on.
aquarius,This is an important time for your work and career and over the coming week you will get the chance to make an impression on employers and other authority figures. If you think your talents are being overlooked now is the time to speak up. ,aquarius,The more someone promises you riches and rewards for just a small investment today the more certain you can be that they are lying and hoping to get rich at your expense. You have never been the gullible sort, so why change now? ,aquarius,Keep your ideas to yourself because if you let slip what you are planning you may lose out in a big way. You may be friendly by nature but in some situations it can be your undoing. Don’t give too much away over the next 24 hours. ,aquarius,You know you have got a lot of routine chores to get through and, of course, you are not looking forward to them, but if you knuckle down and get serious you may be surprised by how quickly you get them finished. Start now. ,aquarius,Usually you don’t care in the slightest if others disapprove of what you are doing but if you are smart you will make an effort to care today. No matter how self­ reliant you may be you must make an effort to work with others.
aquarius,As Venus enters the career area of your chart this weekend you should find ways to make a good impression on employers and other important people. Do something that shows you have passion and commitment, but do it with ease and with style.
aquarius,You don’t suffer fools at the best of times and you certainly won’t suffer them this week. Mars in your fellow Air sign of Libra endows you with total self-belief, and also total disdain for people who seem unable to tell fact from fiction and right from wrong. ,aquarius,If someone tries to abuse their authority today you must not let them get away with it. Having said which, it is unlikely you will get far if you tackle them head on. Find ways to let them see that they have let themselves down. Shame is a powerful weapon.
aquarius,You will do something so strange today that even those who know you well may wonder if you are losing your mind. Maybe you are and maybe you are not but either way it’s good to keep them on their toes. Don’t ever be taken for granted. ,aquarius,Today’s Sun-Uranus link means you are at your best and almost anything you turn your hand to will work out well. Make sure people in positions of power know who you are and what you can do. Your star is very much in the ascendant now. ,aquarius,This is a good time for friendships and group activities but don’t spread yourself too thin. Also, where your work and creative activities are concerned don’t start anything new today because what happens tomorrow will require all your attention and energy.
aquarius,You will be in demand over the next 48 hours, so promise yourself now that you will not accept each and every invitation that comes your way. On the work front, too, you need to remember that quality work impresses more than quantity work.
aquarius,If the recent new moon did not convince you that life is good and getting better by the moment then what happens over the next few days surely will. Just be careful you don’t go to the other extreme and start taking too much for granted.
aquarius,If you try to live up to other people’s image of you then you are likely to exhaust yourself for no good reason. The planets indicate that your health should be your main concern, so don’t try to do it all on your own. You’ve got nothing to prove.
aquarius,It may seem as if what is coming into your life is something you have not earned but that is the wrong way to look at it. If you are being favored it can only be because you have done something in the past that has helped others. So enjoy it! ,aquarius,Because you are not as ego-driven as some signs you tend to hang back when you should be pushing your way to the front of the queue. Today’s cosmic picture will make it easier for you to get noticed and make a good impression – so make the effort. ,aquarius,Resist the urge to point out other people’s faults and failings. And under no circumstances try to cut corners or do anything underhand over the next few days – or it could be your faults and failings that come under the spotlight. ,aquarius,Steer clear of other people’s fights and feuds today and over the weekend because there is nothing you can gain from them. If you stick your nose in where it is not wanted you are inviting someone, maybe several someones, to take a poke at it! ,aquarius,You want nothing more than to be left alone with your thoughts and those who know you well will give you the space you require. Those who don’t know you well will soon discover why it’s a good idea to stay out of your way.
aquarius,Although the Sun’s entry into the most sensitive area of your chart marks the start of a more thoughtful phase, it won’t stop you being active and ambitious. You will also be on the move a lot over the next few days. Travel light.
aquarius,What happens over the next two or three days will see your opinions on one particular issue go through a complete about-face. You are not the sort to admit that you got it wrong but on this occasion you may have no choice. ,aquarius,You will get yet another opportunity to overcome a fear that has been holding you back and this time you must take it. Stop worrying about your life and start living it and enjoying it. There are so many good things in the world. ,aquarius,Don’t worry too much if you seem to be falling behind in your everyday routine because it isn’t that important. What really matters now is that you give some thought to the overall direction your life is heading. A change of course may be necessary.
aquarius,This is a time more for thinking than for doing, so resist the urge to start something new and instead of wasting time on trivial and frivolous people, spend some quality time with your thoughts. What you think today will be your reality tomorrow.
aquarius,You may be tempted to use what you know about a certain person to further your own interests but is that such a good idea? Only you can decide, of course, but ask yourself first if the potential gain is worth the loss in trust it results in.
aquarius,Don’t be disappointed if something or someone stops you from moving in the direction of your choosing between now and the turn of the year. Instead, look at other possibilities and be ready to take advantage of new opportunities. There will be plenty of them.
aquarius,You will be immensely popular over the next few days – everyone wants to get close to you. Having said which, watch what you say and do when people in positions of authority are around as they could turn against you very easily.
aquarius,Give your imagination permission to roam and don’t reject ideas just because they seem too far fetched to come true. You have the power to make things happen but they won’t just happen as if by magic. Visualize your goals then act decisively.
aquarius,You seem to be looking for hidden meanings in everything you see and hear. Is it right that you are this suspicious? Maybe, but more likely there is no great conspiracy, so try to think rationally and in all situations deal only in facts. ,aquarius,No matter how badly someone has behaved and no matter how much they have let you down you will find it impossible to get angry with them. It’s good that you can be so forgiving but don’t let your rivals think you are going soft in the head! ,aquarius,Although the Sun is moving through one of the more sensitive areas of your chart Mars, planet of action and energy, is very much on your side. But only until Sunday, so make the most of it and do something creative, maybe even a little crazy. ,aquarius,You are well aware that success comes about largely through our own efforts but the current cosmic set-up suggests you will be the beneficiary of a stroke of good fortune, either in your personal life or at work. Don’t think about it, just enjoy it. ,aquarius,As Mercury moves into your sign today so your powers of persuasion will get a boost. However, almost immediately Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases, so be careful what you ask for. As for making demands, that’s not a good idea at all.
aquarius,Because action planet Mars is now moving into the area of your chart that governs your professional status it is important that you convince authority figures that you have what it takes to succeed. Don’t leave it any longer – let them know now.
aquarius,A friend is going through a hard time at the moment and, of course, you want to help them in some way. The planets indicate that your best course of action is to keep your distance. Give them the space they need to work things out for themselves. ,aquarius,You need to let partners and loved ones know what you think of them today, even though it may be less than flattering. Don’t worry that you might hurt their feelings – they are not nearly as sensitive as they like to make out. The truth is important.
aquarius,You will need to use all your powers of persuasion today and over the weekend to get done what needs to be done. It may be annoying having to rely on other people but the planets warn you won’t get far on your own. Flatter friends shamelessly. ,aquarius,You must be true to your principles today. Nothing is more important than doing the right thing and your reputation will surely head south if you cut corners or in some other way try to get round the rules. There is much more than money at stake. ,aquarius,You seem to be anxious about something that just a short while ago you would not have wasted a moment’s time on. Overrule your anxiety and tell yourself that only good things will be coming your way over the next few days. Yes, it’s true!,aquarius,Make sure friends and family members know what you are up to and make sure they know they still have a part to play in your life. Sometimes you can be so aloof that you give the impression you no longer care. Nothing could be further from the truth. ,aquarius,You will enjoy life more if you stop trying to force things. Also, it is a universal truth that the more you give the more you get in return, so bestow good things on other people this week – and good things will come back to you.
aquarius,Try not to be so intense over the next few days. Rest assured that everything that is meant to happen will happen when the time is right – you don’t have to fret about it. The most important thing now is to relax and let life come to you.
aquarius,Try not to let your fears get out of hand. Take your mind off your worries by focusing on the many things you have to be thankful for. By the time you get through them all the day will be over – and tomorrow will be more to your liking. ,aquarius,You seem to have a lot of negative feelings at the moment and you need to do something about them. Find a way you can be alone with your thoughts today, for an hour or two at least, so you can get your head back in shape. ,aquarius,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart suggests that your behavior will come in for criticism today. Yes, of course, you can ignore it and carry on as before but if you are smart you will heed the protests and change your ways. ,aquarius,You can afford to be optimistic and you can afford to take risks, so forget about the past and think only of the future. A money-making opportunity will come your way today or over the weekend. Don’t waste time thinking about it – take action! ,aquarius,You seem a bit fearful at the moment, scared to speak or act in case you get it wrong, and that’s not like you at all. Whatever the reason may be, listen to what your inner voice tells you. Never doubt what you already know. ,aquarius,The most important thing now is that you don’t do anything rash. The past few weeks have not been easy but now you are just days away from the Sun moving into your sign, so stay calm and don’t be impulsive. The good times are coming your way.
aquarius,No matter how reserved an Aquarius you may be usually, over the coming week you will go the right the other way and leave those around you, both at home and at work, in no doubt about what you think and feel. It could get emotional! ,aquarius,The next few days mark not just the start of a new solar year for you but also the beginning of a major new phase. Forget everything that has gone before, be it good, bad or indifferent. The only thing that matters is what comes next.
aquarius,The Sun’s move into your birth sign today makes this the ideal time to start new projects, but first you must give up on something that, deep down, you know is never going to work. What you accomplish over the next few weeks will more than make up for it.
aquarius,You must keep dreaming, even if so many of your dreams have failed to come true. Now that the Sun is moving through your birth sign there is every chance that what earlier seemed like a fantasy will quickly become a reality. Lucky you! ,aquarius,You will be concerned with ideas and their practical application today but don’t get so bogged down in your own thoughts that you miss what is taking place in the world around you. Keep your eyes and ears open – and keep your mind open too.
aquarius,Now that the Sun is moving in your favor you should be more optimistic and that’s great. But don’t lose sight of the fact that, in certain areas, there is still a lot of work to be done. Don’t try to do it all on your own.
aquarius,A full moon in your opposite sign warns that if someone makes a mistake this week they may try to put the blame on you. Don’t let that happen. Look out for your own interests and make sure the powers that be know who you are and what you can do.
aquarius,There is always something to be thankful for and there is always something to look forward to, so do what you have to do today with a smile on your face. Your positive attitude is sure to cheer up those who are feeling sad.
aquarius,There is no need to worry and there is no need to hurry. The Sun in your birth sign promises wonderful things and all you have to do is sit back and let it happen. Will it really be as easy as that? Try it and see.
aquarius,If there is an important decision you need to make then make it now, otherwise the matter will be taken out of your hands and given to someone who may not be sympathetic to your needs. Make a choice, believe in it and stick to it. ,aquarius,Your head is full of great ideas but for the time being they must stay in your head because you won’t have the chance to follow up on them for a while. But what’s the rush? Even if you miss one opportunity there will always be another. ,aquarius,If each step forward you take results in you having to take two steps back it might be wise to take the hint and stay put. You don’t have to be on the go every hour of every day, so slow down and enjoy where you are. ,aquarius,A friend or relative will give you some priceless advice this weekend and you would be a fool not to take it. The only problem is your pride: can you admit that they know better than you? Never mind your ego, think about the money!,aquarius,Try to stay on the good side of people in positions of authority. If you say or do something they could take exception to you will be marking yourself out as a troublemaker, and you wouldn’t want that sort of reputation would you Aquarius?! ,aquarius,You need to get away from the daily grind and recharge your batteries in a more tranquil environment. This would be a great time to take a short vacation but if that is not possible at least don’t tax yourself with new chores and responsibilities. ,aquarius,Don’t expect everything to come easy to you on the work front today or tomorrow. Mars in the career area of your chart may make it look as if others are being obstructive but only because they see you as a threat. You can be rather intimidating!,aquarius,More than most signs you realize that change is necessary and you will need that positive attitude today as certain people upset the status quo for no apparent reason. You cannot change what they are doing but you can find ways to benefit from it. ,aquarius,You will have lots of fun today but you may feel a bit guilty about it because not everyone is as happy or fortunate as you. Do what you can to help others get over whatever it is that is bothering them but don’t let their mood bring you down.
aquarius,There will rarely be a better time to start moving in a new direction. Not only is the Sun highlighting your sign but the approaching new moon is encouraging you to leave old ways behind and explore uncharted territory. You are blessed with the spirit of adventure. ,aquarius,Keep telling yourself that there is nothing to fear and that whatever concerns you the most will work itself out for the best over time. Make a conscious effort to focus your mind on the good things in life – there are still plenty of them.
aquarius,Tomorrow’s new moon in your sign promises great things, for you at least. If there is some way you wish you could improve your life now is the time to stop wishing and start making it happen. Look back to the past only to learn for the future.
aquarius,Today’s new moon in your birth sign will give you the boost of confidence you need to start believing that greatness is within your reach. Anything is possible for you now – yes anything – so aim as high as you can and then go higher still.
aquarius,Is there some kind of conspiracy that is stopping you from reaching your goal? Maybe there is but more likely it’s just your mind playing tricks on you. By all means be wary but don’t make accusations that are almost certainly wrong. ,aquarius,The sooner you start believing that Lady Luck is on your side the sooner good things will start happening in your life. Actually they are happening already but for some reason you seem determined not to notice them. You’re letting golden opportunities pass you by.
aquarius,No matter what happens over the next 24 hours try to stay calm, because if you lose your head just a little bit you will very quickly go all the way. You are not always the logical, practical sort others think you are. You have emotions too. ,aquarius,There is a major luck factor working in your favor and if you take advantage of it there is no end to what you can accomplish. Don’t listen to those who say there are limits to what can be done. For you those limits no longer exist! ,aquarius,You need to come to terms with the fact that you alone are responsible for the events of your life. Ultimately there is no such thing as coincidence – everything happens for a reason. Accept that fact and find ways to make it work for you. ,aquarius,Even if you are the kind of Aquarius who plays your cards close to your chest there is a danger you will give too much away this week. If you let slip important information it could give your rivals an advantage they do not deserve. Talk less!,aquarius,There is a very real danger as the new week begins that you will overreact to criticism and say or do something that comes back to haunt you. Both at home and at work you must think carefully before replying to what others say. Control your emotions.
aquarius,Identify what it is you want most out of life, then focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. Others may try to distract you but there is a stubborn side to your nature and when you have a goal in mind you don’t stop until it is reached. ,aquarius,A dispute of some kind will break out today but you have been through this kind of scene before, so don’t worry. The people and places may be different but the emotions involved are the same. That’s good: it means you won’t make the same mistakes twice. ,aquarius,Don’t worry if your cashflow situation is not as strong as you would like it to be, because when the Sun changes signs tomorrow you will find new ways to make money. Of course, that will only be of benefit if you don’t immediately spend it! ,aquarius,The focus of your life is about to change, maybe a little, maybe a lot. One thing that will change is your money situation which, you would be the first to admit, has been less than healthy of late. No more luxuries – essentials only from now on! ,aquarius,You may think you know what’s been going on but the fact is there is still a lot that is being concealed from you, so resist the urge to jump to conclusions. As the full moon gets stronger so the chances of getting it wrong will increase.
aquarius,You may be shocked by what happens this week but the signs have been there for quite some time. How did you miss them? Because you chose not to see them. You of all people should know that the truth will reveal itself eventually.
aquarius,Today’s full moon will force you to take the kind of drastic action you usually prefer to avoid. The most important thing you must realize is that, as far as your finances are concerned, nothing can be taken for granted any more. ,aquarius,Something needs to be brought into the open where it can be discussed. Face up to what has come between you and a friend or family member and find ways to deal with it. There may be a few tears but it will all come right in the end.
aquarius,You may be tempted to retreat into your shell and refuse to join in with social activities over the next 24 hours, and maybe that’s no bad thing, but don’t cut yourself off completely. The planets indicate there could also be a new love attachment today! ,aquarius,Anything and everything is possible for you today but that is not an invitation to ignore common sense and attempt something that is clearly not worth the time and energy that will be required to make it work. Be selective in your enthusiasms. ,aquarius,The Sun left your birth sign a week ago but that does not mean your luck has changed. On the contrary, where money matters are concerned everything seems to be going right for you now. Don’t spend it all though – put some aside for a rainy day.
aquarius,The Sun in the financial area of your chart will help your cashflow situation and with Neptune, planet of imagination, on your side too this weekend you should be thinking “outside the box” about ways to make money. Time to get rich.
aquarius,You must be positive. You must believe in yourself. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your work and career. The planets will make it easy to impress employers and other important people, so what are you waiting for?,aquarius,The planets are trying to warn you that if you don’t slow down over the next two or three days you could end up falling down! Your emotional and intellectual energy may be unlimited but your physical energy is not. Don’t burn yourself out.
aquarius,Something needs to be brought into the open where it can be discussed. Face up to what has come between you and a friend or family member and find ways to deal with it. There may be a few tears but it will all come right in the end.
aquarius,Don’t feel too bad if you have not yet accomplished what you set out to do. There is no time limit to your ambitions and the fact is you have already done a great deal, certainly more than others expected of you. You’re moving in the right direction.
aquarius,Don’t waste time arguing with people whose views are clearly wrong. It is highly unlikely you will convince them, today or any other day, so let them keep on making mistakes while you keep on having fun. Living well is the best revenge.
aquarius,If you find it hard to live within your means that is a sure sign you are doing too many things for too many people – and paying too much for the privilege. How many of your so-called “friends” really care for you? Be ruthless with them today. ,aquarius,Money problems may have receded but that is not an excuse to go on a spree. If you spend more than you can afford this weekend you may end up right back where you started: in debt with no way to pay off what you owe.
aquarius,Upheavals of one kind or another are to be expected over the next few weeks but they are of the sort you will most likely enjoy. A little bit of mayhem is not always a bad thing – it can even throw up unexpected opportunities.
aquarius,Today’s Sun-Pluto link means the best, and maybe the only, way to get results is to transform your current situation. Drastic decisions will have to be made but, having made them, your life will never be the same again – better but not the same.
aquarius,This is not a good day to take chances with money, so keep your cash in your pocket. Tomorrow’s solar eclipse will in some way or other transform your financial fortunes but for the next 24 hours you must not spend a penny.
aquarius,You will discover a new source of income over the next two or three days and that’s good because you were beginning to think you might have to sell something to make ends meet. You are not as poor as you seem to think you are.
aquarius,Life moves in cycles and the cycle you are going through at the moment may be a bit disruptive, but it’s really no big deal. You have handled far bigger challenges in the past and will do so again in the future. You’re a survivor. ,aquarius,You are worrying too much about what you are planning to do. The planets suggest that once the ball starts rolling most problems will take care of themselves. And don’t try to do it all on your own. There is always someone you can turn to.
aquarius,According to the planets you are about to become a lot more serious about a relationship, even more so if there are financial links involved. To put it bluntly: if you have a good thing going don’t do anything that might put it at risk.
aquarius,You don’t seem to be in the right frame of mind to deal with money matters, but there is no need to anyway as everything will work out fine in the long-term. If you feel under pressure it is because you are putting yourself under pressure. ,aquarius,The coming week will throw up not one but several opportunities and you must stay alert if you want to make the most of them. Wherever possible, find out as much as you can about the situations you find yourself in. Forewarned is forearmed.
aquarius,Listen to advice today, even if it comes from people whose opinions you don’t always agree with. If they say you are wasting your time on a project that is close to your heart they may be right. Don’t hold on to what is no longer useful to you. ,aquarius,You must not let anyone persuade you that your goals are not legitimate. According to the planets you are heading in exactly the right direction, so ignore what others say and follow your dream. You are closer to success than you realize. ,aquarius,You may have a lot of tedious tasks to take care of but they won’t be quite such a chore if you share the load with other people. Call in a few favors and get what has to be done out of the way as quickly as possible. ,aquarius,The past few weeks have not been easy but you stuck at your task and very soon you will get your reward. The pendulum is about to swing in your favor and before you know it you will be laughing, dancing and singing again.
aquarius,When the Sun changes signs tomorrow the world will look a happier, sunnier place. Actually, the world has always been a happy, sunny place but for some reason you have not been able to see it that way recently. Remember: your mind creates your reality.
aquarius,Honesty is by far the best policy, even if it means you have to tell a friend what they don’t want to hear. They should be thankful you are the kind of person who can be relied on to point out what is fact and what is fiction.
aquarius,Something is nagging at your conscience and until you deal with it you won’t be able to enjoy the new opportunities that are coming your way. If you have to make an apology to someone then so be it. You were in the wrong after all.
aquarius,With Mercury moving into the communications area of your chart today there is no doubt that you will speak your mind, but will you speak wisely? Make sure that you fully engage your brain before you give your tongue permission to wag. ,aquarius,You may be tempted to make changes today but the planets warn that may not be such a good idea. Stick with what you know and trust, because it may be the case that you don’t have to make changes at all – others will make them for you. ,aquarius,As an Aquarius you have very high standards, but you need to realize that not everyone shares your sense of duty or fair play. Don’t try to hit back at your enemies with the same kind of underhand tactics they use against you. You’re better than that. ,aquarius,Your sixth sense should be warning you that if you make your move too soon you may regret it. Others may demand that you get with the program but their insistence that you act now should set alarm bells ringing. Take your time and get it right. ,aquarius,Someone will try to embarrass you this weekend but they won’t succeed. You don’t have to make excuses for the things you have done. Whatever it is they accuse you of own up to it with a smile and let them know you will do it again. ,aquarius,Everyone has their own way of looking at the world and everyone creates their own reality by what they choose to focus on. If you bear that thought in mind this weekend you won’t worry so much that so many seem to be getting it so wrong.
aquarius,Don’t worry that what you are planning may not meet with the approval of other people because there is nothing they can do to stop you. Be daring and force through the changes you believe are needed, both at home and at work.
aquarius,If you put personal feelings before common sense today you will lose out in some way. You may not want to ask a certain individual for assistance but the fact is only they can help you, so push your pride to one side and ask away. ,aquarius,You will have another go at something that has gone wrong for you on more than one occasion already, and this time it should come right. It’s not about luck, it’s about staying power and refusing to give up. You possess a winning state of mind.
aquarius,By all means make your point of view known but don’t push it if others are reluctant to see things your way. Just lay out the facts as you see them and let them make up their own minds. Don’t make it more complicated than that. ,aquarius,Be careful what you say, and who you say it to, this weekend because the results could be more explosive than you expected. If you want to make the world a better place – and you do – then you should emphasize the positive, not the negative.
aquarius,You will have noticed by now that fate is trying to push you in a new direction. Do you take the hint and go with the flow? Or do you resist and hold yourself back? Only you can decide, but don’t choose the past purely out of habit. ,aquarius,There is no point brooding over things you should have done but for one reason or another did not. All you can do is set yourself new targets and, this time, make sure that you keep those promises you made to yourself.
aquarius,Slow down and listen to what your inner voice tells you. And if it tells you that you would be better off going your own way and doing your own thing then get yourself up and get yourself gone. You’re not in the mood to share.
aquarius,Don’t give up on what you are working on just because it does not seem to be going so smoothly any more. Today’s Sun-Uranus link suggests that something unexpected is about to happen, something which changes the game in your favor. ,aquarius,Keep yourself busy over the next 24 hours, because the more time you have to think about your circumstances the more likely it is you will make unnecessary changes. Give it a bit more time and things will work themselves out just fine. ,aquarius,Don’t give up on what you are working on just because it does not seem to be going so smoothly any more. Today’s Sun-Uranus link suggests that something unexpected is about to happen, something which changes the game in your favor.
aquarius,The coming week should be hugely enjoyable but it will be more enjoyable still if you get over the idea that you need lots of money to have fun. The best things in life really are free, including the love of family and the company of friends.
aquarius,Your attitude may be a bit too aggressive as the new week begins. You may get away with it in the short-term but if you rub people up the wrong way for no good reason they will undoubtedly hold a grudge. Calm down. Make friends, not enemies.
aquarius,You can get more done in a day now than most people get done in a week – you have rarely been more productive. However, there are some really big challenges coming your way later in the month, so don’t use up all your energy.
aquarius,Anyone who drags their feet or makes a mess of what you see as a simple task will feel the rough edge of your tongue today. Just be careful you don’t say or do anything to upset someone whose power might one day eclipse your own. ,aquarius,What happens today will do wonders for your self-belief, not least because it would appear that other people are at last beginning to take notice of your special talents. Now that you have got their attention, make sure you keep it. ,aquarius,Focus your mind on what it is you most desire and don’t let go of it. Imagination is an immensely powerful tool and what you think now will be your reality later on. Strive to be positive and always believe you will eventually succeed.
aquarius,As is so often the case you will choose to go your own way this weekend rather than follow the herd. That’s fine, of course, but don’t reject what others do simply because it isn’t unique. It’s okay to be social sometimes Aquarius! ,aquarius,With so much change taking place in the heavens at the moment your senses are no doubt on red alert. You will take what happens in your stride, as always, but others won’t be so fortunate. Be ready to hold a few hands and calm a few fears.
aquarius,You may find that you are a bit more emotional than usual today, and for the rest of the week, but that’s no bad thing. You don’t have to drown yourself in floods of tears, of course, but you do need to use your heart more often.
aquarius,Someone who is getting on your nerves must be told to tone down their act or stay out of your way. You don’t have to be tactful about it – let them know in words of two syllables or less that you won’t put up with their unacceptable behavior.
aquarius,The last few weeks have been busy to say the least and now you need a period of rest and recovery. Cut back on your social commitments and spend more time at home with those you love. Their calming influence will do you good. ,aquarius,The times are changing and deep down you know that you must change with them. That does not mean you must sign up for the latest fad or fashion, but it does mean you need to leave behind some of your more outdated ideas.
aquarius,Whatever is worrying you right at this moment will be gone by the time the new week begins, so put it out of your mind and concentrate on something that brings a smile to your face. When your mood changes your luck will change too.
aquarius,Someone will demand more of your time and attention this week than you would normally be willing to give, but because you can sense they need your guidance you will make time for them. Let them know it won’t be a regular thing though. ,aquarius,It might be wise to keep your thoughts to yourself today, as friends and colleagues are unlikely to take kindly to criticism, no matter how well-meaning it may be. Honesty is not always the best policy, especially when egos are so fragile. ,aquarius,What happens over the next two or three days may come as a bit of a shock but it will also be quite exciting. Someone new who comes into your life will in some way or other turn your world upside down – and you will love it! ,aquarius,A friend or relative is being emotionally demanding and you have to decide whether to give in and do what they ask of you or whether to say no and disappoint them. It’s a tough decision but it must be one way or the other.
aquarius,If you try to get out of something you previously agreed to take part in your reputation may crash. A promise is a promise, so do what is expected of you and do it with a smile – it won’t be as tough or as boring as you fear.
aquarius,According to the planets you are being far too critical of your own performance. You need to stand back and see what you are working on from a broader perspective. Better still, forget about it for a day or two. It will look better when you return. ,aquarius,This is the ideal time to let loved ones know that you still care for them. Not that you have done anything to make them doubt you, of course, but you can be a bit emotionally detached at times. It won’t hurt you to get passionate.
aquarius,No matter how passionate you may be about certain causes it will pay you to come on a little less strong over the next few days. They may mean a lot to you but not everyone is so enthused, so make allowances – and preach less!,aquarius,Find ways to let partners and loved ones know how much you care for them. Yes, of course, it makes you vulnerable when you reveal your true feelings but human relationships are like that. Don’t be afraid to share your emotions.
aquarius,No matter how difficult the past few days have been you will soon be on top of your game again. Life moves in cycles and the phase you are going through at the moment, while testing, cannot do you any lasting damage. So smile. ,aquarius,You are no doubt eager to get busy on all those chores that have built up but don’t push yourself too hard or your health may suffer. Your mind always moves fast but your body sometimes finds it hard to keep up. Know your limits.
aquarius,It may be tempting to opt for the easy life by giving in to someone’s demands but that will surely make matters worse in the long-term. This is one of those occasions when you need to fight back – if you don’t, they will own you. ,aquarius,Someone who has been difficult to get along with will go out of their way to assist you today and you are sure to be suspicious. The good news is they are not up to any tricks, they genuinely want to be a friend. Respond in kind.
aquarius,Yes, you can trust someone whose ways of thinking and ways of doing things are so very different from your own. Don’t give them control over your affairs but don’t think they have to be watched every minute either. They won’t let you down.
aquarius,You are tougher than most people give you credit for and something will happen that proves it. Chances are you will surprise even those who thought they knew you well by how shrewd an operator you are. You may even surprise yourself!,aquarius,As much as you would like to help a friend in need it may be better to stand back and let the situation work itself out. Saving them from the consequences of their actions could actually be the worst thing to do. Experience is the best teacher.
aquarius,There are some people you will never agree with – you are just too different in your outlook. But that does not mean you cannot be nice to them when your paths cross, as they will today. Ideas and beliefs don’t have to harm human relationships. ,aquarius,Your mind is buzzing with all sorts of interesting ideas at the moment, any one of which could make you rich and famous. But don’t get carried away and think that your ideas are the only ones that count. Get together with your fellow big brains. ,aquarius,Although you are quite open about your opinions you can get touchy if people criticize what you believe. If you react to provocation today a rival will work out where your weak spot is, so act as if you just don’t care. ,aquarius,This may not be the best time to start a new project, so if you are planning something that is important to you try to put it off for a week or so. The Sun’s change of signs on the 20th will give you the green light to act. ,aquarius,You may be reserved by nature, emotionally at least, but you have feelings like everyone else and will find it easier to express them over the next 48 hours. You may also rediscover your passion for a project that has been neglected for a while.
aquarius,You will get lots of opportunities to make your mark when the Sun moves in your favor towards the end of the week. Anything of a creative or artistic nature will be well starred, so look ahead and decide how best to put on a show. ,aquarius,What happens today may seem unfair but if you stand back and look at the situation from a higher perspective you will see it was fated to happen. The world always turns and causes always have effects. What goes around comes around sooner or later.
aquarius,If you feel that someone is challenging you in a way that isn’t fair then you have every right to fight back. Few people are as principled in their actions as you and you don’t have to take it if your rivals start using questionable tactics. ,aquarius,The more you try to resolve a difficult situation, the tougher and more complicated it seems to get. You may not be the sort who gives up easily but, on this occasion, it may be the case that it’s just not worth the effort.
aquarius,As from tomorrow you will be able to do what you want to do, as opposed to what family and friends expect you to do. Find ways to carve out your own little space so you can devote more time to a creative project of some kind.
aquarius,Your confidence will soar over the next 72 hours and you will start to believe once again that all things are possible. Set your sights high and refuse to settle for second best, either in your private life or in your career. Be amazing Aquarius! ,aquarius,The Sun in Gemini will make you more assertive than usual, and that’s a good thing, but other aspects warn you could find yourself on the losing side if you get too aggressive. Don’t annoy people whose goodwill you may have to rely on.
aquarius,You may think you have the power to force through the changes you want to see but a difficult Sun-Mars link warns the costs could be higher than you expected. Persuasion is always better than compulsion. Remind yourself of that fact this week.
aquarius,Your mood will lighten considerably over the next few days, thanks to Venus joining the Sun in your fellow Air sign of Gemini tomorrow. Creatively and romantically this is the best time of year for you, so go on, be extraordinary.
aquarius,The planets are urging you to reach out to someone you have not always got along with in the past. It won’t take much of an effort and the results may surprise you. It could be you have more in common than either of you realized.
aquarius,Certain people need to be kept apart. You know who they are and you know what will happen if they get too close to each other, so do what you can to guide them in different directions. Above all, don’t get caught in the middle. ,aquarius,Negotiations of all kinds will go well today IF you know your own worth and IF you refuse to settle for less. Far from being put off by your inflexibility, others will admire your determination and will agree to meet your demands. ,aquarius,According to the planets you have bitten off more than you can chew and what happens today and over the weekend will make you aware of that fact in no uncertain fashion. You may have to scale back on your ambitions, at least for a while. ,aquarius,Don’t let anyone tell you that you are aiming too high or expecting too much of yourself. The Sun in Gemini at this time of year means you should be expecting more than ever before, so ignore the doubters and go all out for glory. ,aquarius,The Sun in Gemini will make it ridiculously easy for you to get your own way. Both at home and at work people will make extra efforts to provide what you need. Do you take advantage of the situation? You would be a fool not to!,aquarius,This is one of the best times of the year for trying new things, so don’t hold back. Act on the assumption that you only live once and that if you don’t take a few risks you may one day look back and wish you had been more adventurous. ,aquarius,You are not the sort to give up on a project just because it turns out to be tougher than you anticipated. The planets indicate you will make a success of it and the pride you feel will be magnified because of the effort it took. ,aquarius,You will find yourself at odds with a friend over a creative issue today but don’t let it come between you. By all means go your own ways for a while but be ready to get back to working together when the moon is new on the 5th.
aquarius,You won’t stand for any kind of interference in your personal affairs today and anyone who attempts to stick their nose where it isn’t wanted is going to look silly minus the central feature of their face. Make sure they know that well in advance.
aquarius,The power of persuasion is upon you at the moment and you can get almost anyone to believe what you say, no matter how outrageous it might sound. Don’t misuse that power though. What good cause can your way with words assist?,aquarius,The power of persuasion is upon you at the moment and you can get almost anyone to believe what you say, no matter how outrageous it might sound. Don’t misuse that power though. What good cause can your way with words assist?,aquarius,A little bit of extra effort now could bring amazing rewards later in the month, so forget about trivial things and devote yourself to whatever creative or artistic activity means the most to you. Don’t just be good at it – be brilliant.
aquarius,The Sun linked to Venus in your fellow Air sign of Gemini means that creative activities and affairs of the heart are sure to go well. Be confident and courageous and take a few risks – they will pay off many times more than you expected.
aquarius,There is no point being envious of people whose skills outshine your own. Yes, they are better than you in some ways, but in other ways you are the one who stands out from the crowd. You can’t be best at everything Aquarius!,aquarius,You are doing too much – it’s as simple as that. You need to get past the belief that you must work harder and faster and focus on one task at a time. If you don’t you could end the day further away from your goals than when you started.
aquarius,Why are you so fearful of things you have no way of knowing will work out for the best or the worst? Experience should have taught you by now that the only wise course is to be positive at all times. Your mind creates your reality. ,aquarius,Over the next few days you will find that both your energy levels and your enthusiasm reach new heights, making it possible to do things that were beyond you before. Strive for excellence in everything you do. Always aim to be the best. ,aquarius,Everything seems to be coming easier for you now, thanks to the Sun in the most dynamic and creative area of your chart. But don’t take too much for granted because the world never stops turning and circumstances never stop changing.
aquarius,Don’t let other people’s doubts and fears hold you back. If there is something that needs to be done then get on and do it and don’t for a moment think it is beyond your capabilities. All things are possible for those who dare. ,aquarius,You will get the chance to change something that should have been changed a long time ago. This time there are no excuses for opting out: you must be brave and cut the ties that are holding you back and holding you down – you don’t need them.
aquarius,Despite what some might say your life is perfect as it is, so don’t be tempted to change things for the sake of it. On the other hand, with your ruler Uranus so strong now, if you do need to make changes you will go all the way. ,aquarius,The more your critics, of whom there are many, complain that you are going about something the wrong way the more you should be doing it that way. Make such a good job of it that they have no choice but to eat their words. ,aquarius,Steer clear of people whose outlook on life is unnecessarily negative, because almost certainly they will drag you down to their level. You have an important task to take care of and you won’t make a good job of it if you feel depressed. ,aquarius,You need to take life at a more relaxed pace today, not least because you are in danger of working yourself into the ground. Put your ambitions on hold for a while and relax as much as you can. Isn’t it time you started planning your next vacation?,aquarius,You seem determined to take risks, and the bigger the better. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing remains to be seen but you can increase the odds in your favor by acting on your instincts rather than on what other people tell you.
aquarius,It may seem like a good idea to you to change your plans at the last minute but others won’t be impressed. If you value your reputation as someone who can be relied on you will think before you act – and maybe not act at all.
aquarius,If you have faith in your abilities then you will accomplish great things over the coming week. If, however, you let a worm of doubt creep into your mind you may fall short of your true potential. Yes, you have the power to make things happen.
aquarius,Don’t exaggerate your words or actions just to get yourself noticed. Others are aware of what you can do, so why waste time trying to prove yourself? The most important thing is not that others feel good about you but that you feel good about yourself. ,aquarius,You may have got away with breaking the rules in recent weeks while the Sun was moving in your favor but it won’t be so easy now. On the work front especially both your words and your actions must be beyond reproach. Integrity is essential. ,aquarius,Colleagues and employers may be a bit of a pain over the next 24 hours. However, if you stay calm and do what is expected of you then by next week your name will be up in lights. They want to see how you act under pressure. ,aquarius,The most important thing today is that you listen to your conscience, even if it puts you at odds with everyone else. If your inner voice tells you that a certain course of action is wrong you must not ignore it. Be true to yourself.
aquarius,You may be tempted to cut corners and ignore the rule book, and you will most likely get away with it, but you must still know where to stop. If you push the boundaries of what is permissible too far this weekend you could make some powerful enemies.
aquarius,You have been trying too hard to impress people in authority and your efforts have in fact been having a negative effect. As from Wednesday, when Mars moves in your favor again, make it your policy to let other people impress you.
aquarius,You will be extremely busy over the next few days and it may be a while before you get the chance to catch your breath again. But what you achieve will be truly remarkable, so forget about the easy life and push yourself harder than ever. ,aquarius,You may think you can break the rules and get away with it but the fact is you are kidding no one but yourself. People in positions of power will come down on you hard if you stray from the straight and narrow. Play by the book.
aquarius,Don’t be suspicious if someone in a position of authority treats you like a close friend today. Yes, maybe they are being nice towards you because they are after something but it’s also possible they admire you for your skills and dedication.
aquarius,You may fall out with a friend today, most likely over something trivial, but no lasting harm will come of it. Even the best of mates have days when they don’t get along. You will be back on good terms again very soon.
aquarius,There seems to be a lot of disruption and distrust in your life at the moment but it is your own pessimistic attitude that is attracting negative people and negative events. Stop looking over your shoulder and start striding forward to the future.
aquarius,You seem to believe that it is wrong to have fun when people around you are so sad. Nonsense. Unless you are the one who is responsible for their despair – and you are not – there is no reason why you should let their mood affect you. Be happy!,aquarius,Others may think you are too impractical to succeed but the planets suggest you can and will be a success IF you focus your mind on one aim at a time. What is it that inspires you most? Make it the centerpiece of your existence. ,aquarius,A task you don’t much care for has to be done and if you are smart you will do it to the best of your abilities. Not only will it do your reputation a world of good but you won’t have to go back and do it again later on.
aquarius,If you don’t make a conscious effort to slow down today you could end up in a heap. That applies as much to the speed of your mind as it does to your physical activities. Try living in the moment for a change. Tomorrow will take care of itself. ,aquarius,Honesty is, of course, the best policy but it might be wise to bend the truth a bit now to spare a friend or loved one from unnecessary worry. Just this once, tell them what they want to hear. It’s unlikely to do any harm.
aquarius,Let where you are going, not where you come from, be your guide. The choices you make over the next 24 hours will influence your life for a long time to come, so make them wisely and refuse to be weighed down by the past. ,aquarius,A project you are working on would benefit from advice from someone whose experience is way beyond your own. It’s not that you are on the wrong track – you are heading in exactly the right direction – but your methods leave something to be desired.
aquarius,You need to be more consistent. It does not matter how much talent you possess, if you do not apply yourself again and again you won’t reach the heights you are capable of. Do what has to be done and ignore all distractions.
aquarius,There is nothing, no nothing, that you cannot do at the moment. But that does not mean you must do everything. Identify the two or three aims that mean most to you personally, then focus on them to the exclusion of everything else.
aquarius,Don’t worry if your cashflow situation is a bit unstable at the moment, because what happens over the next few days will help you find new ways to make money. That will only benefit you though if you don’t find new ways to spend it as well.
aquarius,Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your opposite sign of Capricorn today, a sign that partnerships and relationships are about to enter a more relaxed phase. But don’t be too forgiving and let people get away with things they don’t deserve.
aquarius,Opportunities to be of assistance will be all around you today and the good deeds you do for others will in some way, shape or form come back to you later. You will also get that wonderful inner glow from knowing you did the right thing. ,aquarius,The most important thing now is that you actively look for ways to co-operate with other people. Remember, too, that everyone has a good side and a bad side but the good side is always much stronger, especially if given encouragement.
aquarius,It may annoy you that a colleague is making life tough for you but there is not a lot you can do about it. Go along with their way of doing things, at least for the moment. At least you won’t get the blame when things go wrong.
aquarius,The Sun at odds with your ruler Uranus means almost anything can happen, so don’t waste time making plans because almost certainly they will have to be changed. The good news is that upheavals in the career sphere will work in your favor.
aquarius,You are being sent certain warning signals and if you take notice of them and what they are trying to tell you then the coming week should be a lot of fun. However, if you ignore them you may make a mistake that is both embarrassing and costly.
aquarius,Just because you cannot work out why a friend or family member is behaving the way they are does not mean they are doing it wrong. More likely it means that you cannot see the whole picture yet. It will be clearer later in the week.
aquarius,Changes in your working routine may not be to your liking but in the long-term they will work in your favor, so don’t try to stop them. Progress will come whether you want it to or not, so be smart and work with the powers-that-be.
aquarius,You will want to explore further afield than usual today but the planets warn you must be careful not to stray into areas where you do not know your way around. Always have a back-up plan and always have an escape route planned. ,aquarius,The planets warn you need to slow down a bit, especially on the work front where you have been doing the job of three or four people. Be smart and realize that your body is giving you signals that you can’t keep up this pace forever. ,aquarius,The Sun in Leo urges you to be fair with partners and colleagues. It also urges you to realise that to get things done you must bring others into your plans. The bottom line is you won’t get very far without other people’s help. ,aquarius,If you have made up your mind what you want to do then get on with it. Don’t discuss the matter with family or friends – it has nothing to do with them. You should be confident enough to move ahead without asking for emotional support.
aquarius,Employers and other authority figures will be impressed by your ability to get on with a wide range of people, even those who don’t share your outlook on work or on life. You will make difficult tasks looks easy – and yourself look good.
aquarius,You will find yourself with your back to the wall over the next few days but that’s okay because you need to be challenged. You won’t be able to rely on other people for advice or assistance, so you will have to handle the situation yourself.
aquarius,You may be anxious to bring a feud to an end but don’t give too much away. If you are to reach a successful compromise it must come from a position of strength. If you give in too easily it will be taken as a sign of weakness.
aquarius,Do something that makes you feel good about yourself today. Don’t worry that it may not be productive – it doesn’t matter. The important thing is to have fun. You have worked long and hard to reach your current position. You deserve some down time. ,aquarius,Something will happen that catches you by surprise over the next 24 hours. It may not be the kind of surprise you enjoy very much but if you are honest you will admit, if only to yourself, that you needed a shock to your system. ,aquarius,To some people the outlook may seem rather glum at the moment but you can see the bright side in even the darkest situation. Which is just as well as Uranus, your ruler, begins one of its retrograde phases today, meaning changes will come thick and fast. ,aquarius,If you have fallen out with someone you are usually on good terms with you can quite easily get back together around the time of Tuesday’s new moon. Let them know you want to be friends again and they will gladly meet you halfway.
aquarius,If you have fallen out with someone you are usually on good terms with you can quite easily get back together around the time of Tuesday’s new moon. Let them know you want to be friends again and they will gladly meet you halfway.
aquarius,Someone will place an obstacle in your path today and your first reaction will be to smash it out of the way. But the planets warn such an extreme reaction could have negative long-term consequences. Look for a compromise solution instead.
aquarius,It may be easy to get irritated, even angry, with people who waste your time on trivialities but you won’t change their ways. Accept them for what they are and find ways you can work together that don’t test your patience.
aquarius,This is a good time to start something new. It is also a good time to impress important people with your views and ideas. But be selective about who you approach. Not everyone, it seems, wants to hear how and why you want to change the world. ,aquarius,Focus on your cashflow situation and put that to rights before turning your attention to more interesting pursuits. Once you feel more secure financially you will find it easier to get done many other things that are not directly money-related. ,aquarius,The position of Venus, planet of affection, in your chart suggests you have developed a crush on someone who, for one reason or another, you cannot have. You need to get over your feelings for them quickly, otherwise it will eat you up inside.
aquarius,Someone in a position of authority will look kindly on you this weekend and you are advised to make the most of it. No matter how talented and intelligent an Aquarius you may be you won’t reach the top without the right connections.
aquarius,Avoid people who talk you down and try to make you feel like a failure. If you want to feel good about yourself today spend time with those friends who like you for who and what you are, not some idealized vision of what you should be.
aquarius,Don’t bother explaining your motives to other people this week because they won’t understand. Do what you want to do and forget about trying to court approval. They will finally “get it” when they see how much you have achieved without them.
aquarius,If you get something you think you do not deserve today don’t hand it back. Most likely the cosmos is rewarding you up front for a good deed you are going to do over the next few days. It knows you never turn down calls for assistance.
aquarius,You need to make a mental effort to stand outside yourself and see how other people perceive you. The Sun in your opposite sign of Leo makes it relatively easy to view yourself through the eyes of those you live with and work alongside.
aquarius,You won’t be much in the mood for work today but that’s okay. Until you have got certain aspects of your personal life sorted you won’t be able to focus on your job or career, so do what has to be done – and do it now.
aquarius,By all means say and do things that other people do not agree with. By all means say and do things that stir it up a bit. A large part of your role in life is to champion the kind of issues that others prefer to avoid or ignore. ,aquarius,If you feel a bit down at the moment try getting involved in an activity that means something not only to you but to the people you care for the most as well. Doing things together this weekend will quickly drive those blues away.
aquarius,The approaching full moon is sure to make you increasingly emotional, even if you are the kind of Aquarius who usually manages to keep control your feelings. By all means scream and shout a bit – you will feel better for it in the long-term. ,aquarius,You must stay focused today. If you let your attention wander, even for a moment, you will end up wasting both your time and your energy on things of no consequence. Also, don’t let loved ones treat you like you are their personal servant.
aquarius,So many changes are taking place in your world at the moment but there is no need to be alarmed. On the contrary, no matter how great the upheavals may be over the coming week you have nothing to fear – and lots to look forward to.
aquarius,If you get the impression that a colleague or a friend is not being honest with you then by all means confront them with your suspicions. It may well be that they have been keeping information from you and you MUST find out what it is. ,aquarius,What happens today will in some way or other remind you that in the greater scheme of things how much you earn and what your social or professional standing may be does not matter in the slightest. It’s love that makes the world go round – always.
aquarius,If you need to make a new start on something, either at home or at work, get busy making it happen this weekend. Once the Sun changes signs on Monday you may find you no longer have the time to spare to get serious about it.
aquarius,The only thing that is holding you back at the moment is your fear of failing and making a fool of yourself. But you will look a bigger fool in the long-term if you fail to act and miss out on something huge. You’ve got to go for it.
aquarius,You need to weigh your options carefully before making a decision to do with your long-term finances. If you act on impulse over the next few days you will most likely regret it later on when you realize how much you have wasted or lost.
aquarius,Why are you so suspicious of those you work and do business with? Why do you find it so hard to trust them? There is a danger that you will start reading all kinds of bad intent into what they are doing. Try not to be so distrustful.
aquarius,Don’t be too hard on someone who lets you down or makes a simple task look difficult. Not everyone can be as talented as you, so make allowances for those who will always be second class. Praise them even when you don’t really mean it.
aquarius,You may have a particular goal in mind for the next few weeks but don’t hold on to it too rigidly. You need to be flexible if you are to make the most of the opportunities coming your way. Happiness and success can be found in many directions. ,aquarius,There is a lot of tension in your life at the moment and you must find ways to get rid of it that don’t result in you starting a war. Physical activity of all kinds is good but team sports are better. Pain shared is pain halved.
aquarius,You know what needs to be done and you won’t hesitate to do it, no matter how many people say you are barking up the wrong tree. Your self-confidence means you don’t need other people’s permission or even their support. Do what you know to be right.
aquarius,Keep your schemes and dreams to yourself over the next few days because if the wrong person gets to hear what you are planning they may try to sabotage your efforts. There is no copyright on ideas, so don’t give too much away.
aquarius,The harder you have been pushing yourself in recent weeks the more you must slow down now. You don’t have to do anything special over the next few days because fate will bring you the right opportunities at the right time. Why work up a sweat?,aquarius,At some stage today you will have to admit, if only to yourself, that something you have always taken for granted is in fact completely wrong. It won’t be a comfortable experience but you certainly need to change your worldview a bit.
aquarius,What happens over the next 48 hours may shock you to the core but you should have seen it coming. What you are required to do may seem like a backward step but later in the year you will realize it was for your own benefit.
aquarius,Make an effort to tie up loose ends today. And make an even bigger effort to get back on good terms with people you have fallen out with over the past few weeks. Whatever your differences may be, they are no longer worth the hassle. ,aquarius,If you are having doubts about some kind of deal there is still time to back out of it, but you have got to be quick. After today you will be expected to uphold your end of the agreement. There will be penalties if you do not.
aquarius,What you thought was bad news earlier in the week may turn out to be good news over the next few days. But don’t go to the opposite extreme and believe that nothing can possibly go wrong – that is just asking for trouble.
aquarius,A partnership that has been on the rocks may not survive the stresses and strains of the next few days but that’s okay. The planets indicate it is time for a change, as you have been putting more into certain relationships than you have been taking out. ,aquarius,Get out and about today and make sure everyone knows what you can do and how ambitious you are to succeed. Important people are watching you closely and if they like what they see there is no limit to how high you can fly.
aquarius,You have always been good at seeing patterns and what you see today will convince you that recent events are not random but part of a greater cosmic design. Your big task is to find ways to make that design work for you. ,aquarius,Stop cursing fate that you have not got the breaks you think you deserve and start taking the kind of practical steps that will bring you long-term success. Everyone is born with a talent, so identify your own and find ways to make it pay. ,aquarius,With Jupiter about to move into one of the more positive areas of your chart you should be feeling quietly confident that your luck is about to change for the better. The change could be dramatic if you resolve to be more adventurous. ,aquarius,You will do something out of the ordinary this weekend, something that gets you noticed and talked about. But be careful when dealing with people in positions of power as they may resent you getting so much attention. Make them look good too.
aquarius,No matter how independent an Aquarius you happen to be you would be wise to work closely with other people over the next few days. Your latest creative venture is more likely to be a success if you get family and friends involved too.
aquarius,Don’t be surprised if someone you thought you could count on decides not to go along with your plans today. If you are smart you will ask them why they are so reluctant – you could learn something that saves you from yourself.
aquarius,There is a danger that you will overreact to the kind of provocation that usually would not bother you in the slightest. If you let your temper get the better of you it could cost you dearly, professionally, financially and maybe even romantically too.
aquarius,You seem to be rather suspicious of late and it most likely has something to do with the upcoming eclipse. In reality you have little to worry about – and even if you did do you really want to spend your life looking over your shoulder? ,aquarius,It has taken you a long time to face up to reality about your cashflow situation but you can no longer deny that something needs to be done. Don’t turn down an offer of some kind – it may not be great but something is better than nothing. ,aquarius,You may find big displays of emotion embarrassing but even so you will be unusually affectionate over the next 48 hours. Anyone who is fortunate enough to be in your good books will be left in no doubt at all how special they are.
aquarius,If someone in a position of authority uses their power to get an unfair advantage today you are advised to make note of the fact but not say or do anything about it just yet. Your chance to get your own back will come later in the week. ,aquarius,No matter how bad things may look at the moment they will look much better when the Sun moves in your favor on Thursday, so keep your head and keep telling yourself that life isn’t as terrible as some people are trying to convince you.
aquarius,Don’t worry about your rivals and enemies – act as if the whole world is your friend. That need not be far from the truth as it happens. You have a natural talent for winning over those who, for whatever reason, doubted you to begin with. ,aquarius,As the Sun joins Jupiter in your fellow Air sign of Libra today your worries about money and other material issues should fade quickly. Yes, of course, it’s still smart to watch what you spend but it’s unlikely you will be so compulsive about it.
aquarius,You will find it ridiculously easy to get your way with employers and other important people today – it’s as if you are the boss and they exist to please you. It’s unlikely this strange phase will last, so make the most of it while you can. ,aquarius,At some stage this weekend it will occur to you that you could do with a vacation – in fact you are desperate for one. Get as far away from the crowds and the chaos as you possibly can. Don’t ask anyone’s permission, just go. ,aquarius,Even an Aquarius gets it wrong occasionally, so don’t think you have to cover up a mistake of some kind. If you own up to what you have done it may surprise you how sympathetic people are. If nothing else it will remind them that you are human.
aquarius,Why are so many people being so friendly toward you? No doubt it makes you suspicious but it shouldn’t. According to the planets this is one of those times when everyone is on the same wavelength. It doesn’t happen often, so enjoy it.
aquarius,If you let slip information that can in some way or other be used against you it most likely will be, so watch what you say and watch who you say it to. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that everyone wants to see you succeed.
aquarius,What seems such a trivial issue to you may be of major importance to others, so don’t ignore it. If you want some peace today it might be wise to make it look as if you share other people’s concerns – even if you really could not care less.
aquarius,You can, if you wish, sit back and do nothing but that would be a waste. The planets indicate there is precious little you cannot do if you set your mind to it, so get your act in gear and show the world what star quality looks like. ,aquarius,You may be tempted to end a relationship that has been nothing but trouble in recent months but is that such a wise move? The planets indicate you may undergo a major change of attitude today, so give it another 24 hours or so.
aquarius,You may be tempted to get your own back on someone who has let you down or made you look foolish but is it worth the effort? Rise above petty things this weekend and forgive those you think have done you harm. Don’t pursue senseless vendettas.
aquarius,The Sun in Libra at this time of year makes you more adventurous than usual, so by all means do something out of the ordinary this week. A trip away from your usual environment would be nice. Leave the world you know behind for a while.
aquarius,The more noise you have made about how much you are going to accomplish the more you will be expected to deliver. The Sun in Libra does wonders for your confidence but try not to make claims you may not be able to keep. ,aquarius,Someone you think of as a friend is actually a rival and the fact that you are only now beginning to catch up with that fact shows how easily you have been mislead. The chances are no harm has been done, but be more careful in future.
aquarius,Someone will pull rank on you over the next 24 hours and you will have no choice but to do as they say. Keep your thoughts to yourself and don’t let them see how annoyed you are. You’ll get your own back later in the month. ,aquarius,Whatever you do over the next few days someone is sure to criticize you for it. Fortunately, you have enough self-confidence not to let their negativity get to you – you may even enjoy doing things that you know will upset them. ,aquarius,Some people are getting suspicious that your winning streak is going on so long and will start to dig into your past. You may have nothing to hide but you don’t have to make it easy for them. Make sure your affairs are as private as possible. ,aquarius,It may be that a friend has deceived you in some way but it’s no big deal, so don’t make an issue of it. Pretend you have not noticed and carry on as usual. Most likely they already feel guilty and are determined to make it up to you.
aquarius,Someone you meet on your travels will play a major role in your life over the next few months, so get out into the world and make contact with as many people as you can. The further you spread your net the more fish you will catch. ,aquarius,There seems to be something that is holding you back from taking a risk and that’s a shame because the planets indicate if you go for it you will gain in ways you had not anticipated. Thinking about it is not enough – you must do it, now.
aquarius,You will do something so out of character, so outrageous, today that even those who know you well will be shocked. Hopefully it won’t tarnish your reputation too much but it will certainly give others something to think about – and gossip about. ,aquarius,You seem to be on the verge of giving something up, something that has been a central part of your life for years, but if you are smart you will leave it a while before making a final decision. Ultimately, you may not have to let it go. ,aquarius,Just because other people expect you to be the life and soul of the party does not mean you have a duty to be so. Your first duty is, was and always will be to yourself, so by all means avoid bright lights and noisy people today. ,aquarius,Make the most of the Sun in your fellow Air sign of Libra because by the end of next week your workload will double and new duties and responsibilities, at home and at work, will be placed on your shoulders. Have fun while you can. ,aquarius,You may be tempted to give up on your current work situation and go some place where you feel more appreciated but that’s a huge overreaction. Compared to most people you have got everything going for you. Stay where you are and work it out.
aquarius,You may be a bit excitable this week but nothing bad will come of it. In fact this promises to be a rather good time for you, especially if you are planning a vacation for before the end of the year. Have something to look forward to.
aquarius,Once again you are worrying about something that is not worth the effort. Most likely someone in a position of authority has been giving you a hard time, but it’s no big deal, it’s just who and how they are, so let it wash over you.
aquarius,No matter how hard you try to keep your feelings hidden today they will burst into the open in the most spectacular of ways. Hopefully no innocent bystanders will get hurt but if they do it will be your responsibility to nurse them back to health.
aquarius,What looks like a great idea today could look like the worst idea ever come the weekend, so keep your enthusiasm within reasonable bounds. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart at the weekend will give you new targets to aim for.
aquarius,As the Sun moves into the career area of your chart over the next few days you must expect employers and others in positions of power to make demands of you. Stay calm and keep your mind free of fear. You can do what they ask of you.
aquarius,You have waited in the wings long enough – now you must step into the spotlight and accept that you are going to be the focus of attention for a while. It won’t always be a comfortable experience but it’s essential for long-term success. ,aquarius,The time has come to look seriously at your aims and ambitions. Chances are you would like to try something new, maybe even move in a different direction. If so, now is the time to think deeply about it and then act decisively. Make it happen.
aquarius,Forget about keeping a low profile – as from today you will have no alternative but to stand tall and make yourself heard. Some people may try to shout you down but the more they scream the more you will know you are saying the right things.
aquarius,The planets warn you must play by the rules. If you try to cut corners your rivals will be on you in a flash, hoping to undermine your position. That applies especially to your career. You’ve got a good thing going, so don’t spoil it.
aquarius,You may be of a mind to push ahead forcefully but the planets urge you to wait and see what fate brings your way. Almost certainly a new opportunity will arise before the end of the week, so stay loose and be ready to move fast. ,aquarius,You believe in speaking your mind, and you do it very well, but too much frankness could lead to problems today. If you must call it as you see it at least wrap what you have to say in sugar coating. Some people’s egos are extremely fragile. ,aquarius,Social activities are under excellent stars at the moment, so seek out people who think and act like you and have a good time together. If you are looking for love you could find it with someone who shares your political and ethical values. ,aquarius,You will get the chance to move up in the world over the next 48 hours – if you act quickly and if you stay calm. Uranus, your ruler, is energized by Mars, so sudden upheavals are likely, and you are perfectly placed to benefit from them.
aquarius,Important people are watching you closely and generally speaking they like what they see, but there are still doubts in some circles that you have what it takes to succeed. Make it your aim over the next few days to prove the doubters wrong. ,aquarius,You seem to believe that if you turn your back for even a moment a rival will take what you own or in some other way profit at your expense. Maybe they will but how much can they actually hurt you? Not a lot. Don’t overreact.
aquarius,You may dread what you have to do today but the more you worry about it the harder it will be. Chances are that once you get started it won’t be as difficult as you expected, so put your fears behind you and make like you mean business.
aquarius,It’s good that you believe in yourself but don’t go too far and make promises you may find hard to keep. That could be doubly dangerous if you make promises to the kind of people who have the power to make life uncomfortable for you.
aquarius,You may not entirely trust what you hear today but don’t let that stop you from acting on it. Even if the situation has been exaggerated somewhat there is still enough information there for you to work on, and hopefully profit from too. ,aquarius,Uranus, your ruler, has a tendency to make you act in haste and that will certainly be the case this weekend. Before rushing in where angels fear to tread make sure you at least know the lie of the land – and where the emergency exits are located!,aquarius,The message of the stars for the coming week is that you must set your sights higher – in fact much higher. Show employers and other important people that you are special, that you can get things done, that you were born for bigger and better things.
aquarius,The Sun in the career area of your chart encourages you to put your ideas to the test. They will undoubtedly transform your life but you will also be attacked by those who want to uphold the status quo. Your revolutionary spirit will see you through.
aquarius,You are in a bit of an extravagant mood at the moment and will most likely go over the top one way or another. Avoid the temptation to spend large sums of money on things you don’t really need – you will only hate yourself for it later on.
aquarius,Mars, planet of energy and ambition, moves into your birth sign today, starting a phase in which you will want to make your mark on the world. Just make sure it is the right sort of mark. Fame is good. Infamy most certainly is not. ,aquarius,Mars in your birth sign means that for the next few weeks at least your confidence will be amazingly high. Any task you set yourself will be completed with ease. Any goal you set yourself is as good as reached already. Be brilliant.
aquarius,You may be hugely ambitious but try not to come on too strong – if you do you could easily turn employers and other authority figures against you. Popularity may not bother you in the slightest but it does not have to be you against the world. ,aquarius,You may be generous by nature but there is a danger you will go too far this weekend. Sometimes you are so forgiving that you let people get away with things they should really be punished for. Don’t be too generous for your own good!,aquarius,The most important thing this week is that you don’t jump to conclusions. The very last thing you want to do now is to turn friends and loves ones against you, but that could easily happen if you allow yourself to get carried away. ,aquarius,If you give away too much personal information today you will almost certainly regret it tomorrow. Be wary of strangers who try to strike up a friendship – almost certainly they are looking to gain at your expense. You’re not that stupid, are you? ,aquarius,You may not get everything you desire between now and the Sun’s change of signs on the 21st but you will get enough to keep you moving toward your long-term goal. Career-wise there has rarely been a better time to make your mark. ,aquarius,Your ambitions are more likely to bear fruit if you act now – not tomorrow or next week but right now, this very minute. Don’t bother making plans, they’re a waste of time, just get on and do whatever it is that inspires you the most.
aquarius,You will get what you desire without too much trouble today but having got it you may wonder if it was worth even a small effort after all. Your mood will change drastically early next week, so hang in there – you’ll soon be smiling again.
aquarius,You need to get over the idea that making money from what you are good at is somehow immoral. On the contrary, you were born with a special gift for a cosmic reason and the only crime you can commit is if you refuse to profit from it.
aquarius,Recent events made it possible for you to move up in the world but now you must decide if that is what you truly desire. Are you hungry for success, or hungry to change the world? Maybe there is a way you can enjoy both? Think about it.
aquarius,Any doubts you’ve been having about a plan or project will disappear as from today. It’s not just a good idea, it’s a brilliant idea, and you MUST now give it your undivided attention. Some say you’re a genius – and they could be right!,aquarius,Your way with words will either help you or harm you today, depending on whether you speak up to encourage people or to criticize them. If it’s the former you will make friends. If it’s the latter you will make enemies. Words should heal, not hurt.
aquarius,Opportunity will knock loud and clear today, but will you answer? If you try to avoid taking part in what is going on around you in the world you may look back later on and wish you had not been so reticent. It’s just life, so get involved.
aquarius,You will come into contact with the right people in the right places at the right time today – but after that it is up to you to make the right impression. Look smart, talk tough and exude an air of confidence. How can they not be impressed?,aquarius,Don’t tie yourself down to tasks and chores that bore you. Mars in your sign urges you to be adventurous and that applies to the small things as well as the big things. Each and every thing you choose to do must get you noticed. ,aquarius,Be confident about your opinions and make sure you defend them courageously. Certain people are sure to kick up a fuss and complain that your views are beyond the pale but only you can decide what limits to impose on your ideas, if any. ,aquarius,Seek out people who make you think. Yes, of course, you like to think for yourself and you are good at it but there is still a lot you can learn from those whose experience of life is vastly different from your own. There is always more to discover.
aquarius,Try talking to people you would usually go out of your way to avoid. You may be surprised to discover you have much in common. If you make an effort to reach out and make contact this week you will make some interesting new friends.
aquarius,Deep down you have been having doubts about certain issues and the way that you view them and your doubts will come to the surface over the next 24 hours. Next time, try to look past superficial answers – they are rarely the right ones. ,aquarius,Nothing in life is set in stone. Even if you seem to be heading down a predestined course you can still change direction. Be aware of the forces that are shaping your life but be aware too that free will trumps everything – so use it. ,aquarius,Try not to accept things at face value, especially where affairs of the heart and other intimate contacts are concerned. What people say and what people mean are likely to be two different things today, tomorrow and over the weekend, so be careful. ,aquarius,You only have to put a name to your dream to see it come true. Can it really be that easy? Yes it can, because with Mars in your sign linked to luck planet Jupiter the cosmos is smiling on you – and all you have to do is smile back. ,aquarius,This is a special time for you and it will get even more special over the weekend. You have all the energy and self-belief you need to put on a show and make a good impression. You can still be controversial but be controversial for a reason. ,aquarius,Take your pleasures where you find them and forget about all the serious things you still have to take care of. As Venus moves into your sign this week you have every right and every reason to indulge your whims and fancies. Love, laugh and be happy. ,aquarius,Make a conscious effort to overlook other people’s faults and failings today. You won’t win friends and influence people if you keep pointing out where they are going wrong. Focus on their good points for a change, even if you need to make them up!,aquarius,You will meet someone today whose opinions are about as far away from your own as it is possible to get. You have as much chance of changing their beliefs as they have of changing yours – none – so agree to disagree and move on.
aquarius,With Mars, planet of ambition, moving through your sign you honestly believe that all things are possible – and indeed they are – but that is not an invitation to just charge ahead blindly. Think before you act or the consequences could be embarrassing.
aquarius,You should be aiming higher than you have ever aimed before. If there is something new you would like to start, something that excites you, now is the time to stop dreaming about it and start doing the things that will make it happen.
aquarius,This is the ideal time to take a trip or vacation. With the Sun in the friendship area of your chart allied to Jupiter in the travel area of your chart you are guaranteed exciting adventures wherever you go and whatever you do. The fun times start now,aquarius,You may not be much in the mood for socializing this weekend but that’s okay because you have a great deal to think about. Find a secluded spot and ponder your life and its meaning. True happiness comes from knowing yourself.
aquarius,Everything seems to be going so well for you at the moment that you may be lulled into a false sense of security. Nothing bad is likely to happen but why take the chance? Get your head together and take nothing for granted.
aquarius,Whether or not a new friendship stands the test of time remains to be seen but even if it is short-lived it will give you a lift and restore your faith in human nature – yes, of course there are still some nice people out there in the world.
pisces,Now is the time to start thinking seriously about moving in a new career direction. Don’t let fear, be it of the unknown or of failure, hold you back because the planets suggest you will love every moment of it. Dare to be different.
pisces,You may have strong opinions about something and you have every right to express them but you need to accept that not everyone agrees with you. Try not to get angry if others refuse to see things your way. It’s no big deal.
pisces,You may be dreading upheavals on the work front but the planets suggest you have little to worry about. Yes, in the short-term there will be some adjustments to make, but over time you will benefit from a change or regime.
pisces,Someone who has a lot more experience than you could be of enormous help    today, but you need to remember that they can’t ready your mind. Whatever it is you desire you must spell it out for them in plain and simple language.
pisces,Someone in a position of authority will praise you for a job well done and your confidence will go through the roof. But don’t get sloppy. The reason you did such a good job was because you planned carefully and worked hard. Keep at it. ,pisces,You need more fun in your life but you won’t get it hanging around the same old places doing the same old things with the same old people. The planets are urging you to be more adventurous. Life is a gamble or it is nothing.
pisces,Seek out people who share your values and beliefs. Not only can you change the world if you work intelligently together but you can also benefit in material ways. It’s okay to be a Good Samaritan and make a profit too.
pisces,If your reputation means anything to you then you must be careful what you say over the next few days. If you blurt out an opinion that does not sit well with the powers that be you could do your career prospects considerable harm.
pisces,You are entitled to your opinions but if you are smart you will tone down some of your more outrageous ideas today, at least while in the presence of people you need to stay on good terms with. Certain things don’t have to be said.
pisces,If you are thinking of making a trip of some kind, that’s good, but keep your plans flexible. Last minute changes are more likely than not over the next 24 hours, so be prepared and, more importantly, be open to new possibilities.
pisces,Be decisive today: think and act fast and don’t worry too much about what the consequences might be. Your forthright manner may annoy a few people but that’s okay. They need to know you’re not the sort to be messed around.
pisces,Are you making the most of your time? Chances are you have allowed hours, days, even weeks to slip by without doing anything special. That must now change. Get serious about your ambitions and do something out of the ordinary today.
pisces,Jupiter and Saturn link across the most favorable angles of your chart today and the most likely outcome is that you will be rewarded for services you have done for others in the past. Enjoy your good fortune – no one deserves it more.
pisces,You will need to read between the lines this weekend because almost certainly the real story will be nothing like the one other people are trying to sell you. Facts are important but don’t forget they can conceal as well as enlighten.
pisces,There may be a certain amount of strife over the next few days as partners and loved ones get emotional about things that don’t worry you in the slightest. Do what you can to soothe them but don’t let their negativity spoil your plans.
pisces,You must check facts and figures carefully today as Mercury linked to retrograde Jupiter warns that either someone is trying to deceive you or you will in some way deceive yourself. See what is there, not what you hope is there.
pisces,Accidents will happen but that does not mean they have to happen to you. The planets warn that if you go looking for adventure you will find it okay- which may be fun to begin with but later on it will be you who slips and falls.
pisces,You seem to have lost your way a little and the planets suggest you swallow your pride and ask someone who knows what they are doing to help you. Don’t think of it as a sign of failure if anything it’s a sign of maturity.
pisces,You need to convince those in positions of power that you deserve to be given more responsibility and the rewards that go with it. Timing is everything and the right time is now – so get a move on and move up in the world.
pisces,By all means state your case today but don’t get upset if others disagree with you and try to pick holes in your arguments. The world is a big enough place for all shades of opinion, so agree to disagree and leave it at that.
pisces,You need to take a more relaxed view of partnerships and friendships, both in your personal life and at work. Treat others as if they are allies and equals rather than rivals and enemies and life will be fun and profitable in equal measure.
pisces,Your willingness to work as part of a team will bring many benefits over the next few weeks, not least the boost it gives to your reputation. Friends will be lucky for you but employers and other authority figures will be luckier still.
pisces,What appears to be a disappointment today will have you jumping for joy later in the week, so don’t let your emotions swing too wildly one way or the other. Overall your outlook is extremely good, so don’t waste time worrying.
pisces,Try not to get too emotionally involved in other people’s problems. Life is full of ups and downs and you, and they, would be wise to accept that fact. A more light-hearted approach from you today will be an example for them to follow.
pisces,This should be a fun time for you but there is one unpleasant fact that has to be faced. The good news is that once you resolve to deal with the issue it won’t be anywhere near as bad as you fear, so be bold and take action now.
pisces,Pay attention to what friends and family members tell you over the next 24 hours because they can see something that you have missed. If you listen to what they say and act on their advice it could save you a lot of trouble.
pisces,Steer clear of subjects and situations which lead to disagreements over the next 24 hours. If you think that your opinions might be too controversial and that some individuals or groups might be offended, keep them to yourself – for now.
pisces,Sit back and take what comes your way this weekend. Almost certainly it will be pleasant and almost certainly it will be profitable. You don’t have to do anything special – just be yourself and the let the universe reward you for it.
pisces,Everyone is entitled to their opinions but that does not mean all opinions are equal. If a point of view you have held for years is shown to be lacking in some way then don’t be afraid to give up on it. Opinions evolve like everything else.
pisces,Your dreams can and will come true – if you believe in them. Make sure you share them with friends and loved ones too because your dreams and their dreams overlap in so many ways. Work together toward a long-term goal.
pisces,Stick to your principles over the next 24 hours, even if you lose out financially. Others can be underhanded and devious if they so wish, but you are made of better stuff. It’s not about money, it’s about doing the right thing. ,pisces,You will be surprised how quickly and easily you get things done, so stop telling yourself that you are too far behind to catch up, because you’re not. Get the boring stuff out of the way early, then have fun for the rest of the day.
pisces,Everyone you know may believe one thing but if your instincts tell you a different story it is your instincts youmust trust. There is such a thing as herd mentality and there’s a lot of it about at the moment. Always think for yourself.
pisces,Whatever your special talent happens to be, you must put it to good use. If an opportunity arises in your work or career grab it with both hands and don’t worry that you may not be up to the task. You’ll ace it and make a name for yourself. ,pisces,You are under no obligation to get involved in other people’s problems — in fact you are strongly advised to steer clear of them all this weekend. Yes, of course, you want to help, but some things are best left to run their natural course.
pisces,Make it your aim this week to form alliances with people who share your concerns. You don’t have to agree on every single detail about every single issue, just the overall picture. Together you can create something important.
pisces,An important arrangement may have to be changed at the last moment today but don’t get angry or uptight because most likely it will work in your favor. Strange as it may seem your friends really do know what is best for you.
pisces,There is a great deal going on behind the scenes at the moment, so don’t make too many plans because they are sure to change. If someone asks you to take on more work, turn them down flat — it’s the last thing you need right now. ,pisces,You must let a certain person know that you have no intention of allowing them to get rich at your expense. Today’s Mars-Jupiter link will bring tensions to a head, making it the perfect time to say what’s on your mind – loudly!,pisces,If someone wants to rant and rave and make a nuisance of themselves let them get on with it. Most likely they are hoping you will overreact. Don’t give them the satisfaction. Treat them with the contempt they deserve – ignore them completely.
pisces,It may seem to other people that you are lucky, that what you have got you have not really earned, but it isn’t true. The cosmos always rewards those who deserve it and no one deserves it more than you. Why? Because you’re so nice.
pisces,Be careful what information you choose to trust this week, even if it comes from a reliable source. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to romantic matters. It could be that someone is deliberately stirring up trouble.
pisces,You will leave what you have to do to the very last minute today – and because you have to act fast and without thinking will most likely make a good job of it. There’s a lot to be said for living on the edge – but not all the time.
pisces,Try not to come on too strong today or you may scare away the people you most need to connect with. Remember too that not everyone wants to change the world – in fact some people like it just the way it is. Respect that fact.
pisces,It will pay you to steer clear of touchy subjects over the next 48 hours. Yes, of course, there are things going on in the world that you disapprove of but will getting involved on an emotional level change anything? Of course not.
pisces,You may find it hard to stay focused today and if that is the case you are advised to stop trying and let the cosmic winds blow you where they will. Ultimately all roads lead to where you are destined to be, so why struggle?,pisces,Sometimes things go wrong for a reason and sometimes things go wrong for no reason at all. What goes wrong today will most likely fall in the latter category but it’s really no big deal. Come Monday you will have forgotten all about it.
pisces,It may feel as if a stage or cycle in your life is coming to an end, and maybe it is, but there is no reason why you should feel sad about it. By all means spend some time thinking about what it all means, but have fun too.
pisces,You will be happier working behind the scenes over the next few days. In fact, as the Sun moves into the most sensitive area of your chart on Monday you will avoid the limelight at all costs. Being noticed does not appeal to you at all.
pisces,What happens over the next few days, and especially towards the end of the week, will toughen you up and make you less likely to crack under pressure in the future. On this occasion, short-term difficulties will lead to long-term gains.
pisces,This may be a difficult time for you and you are certainly more sensitive than usual, but it is also a time when you can learn a great deal about yourself, which in turn makes success in the long-term more likely. Self-knowledge is the key.
pisces,Don’t worry if the party spirit seems to have passed you by because it is the inner spirit, the real you, that matters. The planets indicate that the deeper you think about your life and its meaning today the more you will enjoy it tomorrow.
pisces,Be careful who you confide in today because if you reveal your secrets to the wrong person they won’t remain secret for long! Even with friends you can trust it might be wise not to let them in on potentially embarrassing information.
pisces,You need to rediscover your passion for a project that started off well but then tailed away as other things demanded your time and attention. It doesn’t have to be a fantasy that remains forever unfulfilled. There is still time to make a success of it.
pisces,Take care that your emotions don’t sweep you away over the next 48 hours. That applies not only to affairs of the heart but also to situations where you feel sorry for someone who is not as fortunate as you. It’s not your fault.
pisces,A lot may be going on in the world at the moment but the only thing that should matter to you is what is going on inside your head. Think deeply about your life and the direction it seems to be taking. Then make a decision. Then act.
pisces,A quick decision is not always the best decision, so stop worrying that you are being left behind and need to do some catching up. According to the planets you are precisely where you are supposed to be and don’t need to change a thing.
pisces,This is one of the most important times of the year for you, especially if you are fed-up with who you are and what you are doing and wish to transform your existence. So, who do you want to be and where do you want to be it?,pisces,Listen to advice, and don’t be afraid to act on what you hear. Not everyone is trying to trick you or steal from you, so play down your suspicions and play up to the kind of important people who can help you. They’re on your side.
pisces,Why do you have so many doubts? And why do you let those doubts hold you back? You’ve got to be more ambitious. You’ve got to be more adventurous. This could be the day when your life changes for the better – but only you can make it happen.
pisces,Your future has rarely looked brighter. So why so glum? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it and recognize that, compared to most people, you are on easy street. All you really have to worry about is staying there.
pisces,Whatever has been worrying you in recent weeks will fade to nothing this weekend, leaving you feeling as if anything is possible again. But be careful. Don’t go to extremes and take on a task that is clearly too much for you.
pisces,Make sure you are aware of what is going on around you today. Most importantly of all make sure you can see how other people’s decisions might affect your own aims and ambitions. On the work front especially, take nothing for granted.
pisces,You are so supremely self-confident at the moment that you can’t see the huge obstacle that is just a little way ahead of you on the path you have taken. You will see it in a day or two but, in the meantime, ignorance is bliss!,pisces,Whatever you start today will most likely be a success, maybe even a huge success, but as from tomorrow you won’t be quite so lucky, so if there is something that simply has to be done, you are advised to get on with it — now. ,pisces,You are hardly the most decisive person at the best of times and with Mercury, planet of communication and the mind, turning retrograde in your sign today you will change your mind yet again. Others won’t like it but you are who you are.
pisces,What society tells you is important and what your inner voice tells you is important are likely to be two entirely different things. It does not matter how well qualified some people may be, you should never go against your instincts.
pisces,You will be in a remarkably forgiving mood over the next few days, and that’s good because there’s a lot to forgive. The thing to remember is that you are not just forgiving for other people’s benefit but also for your own.
pisces,You may be tempted to bend rules and cut corners but if you do you will be found out around the time of the full moon on the 14th. You don’t need to give yourself an unfair advantage – your luck will change for the better very soon.
pisces,You may be tempted to act first and justify your actions later, but if you do, you will have a lot of explaining to do. Today’s Sun-Saturn link warns that the consequences of misguided action could be severe, so tread carefully. ,pisces,Stop selling yourself short and start making the kind of moves that will get you noticed. Even if you are the kind of Pisces who prefers to stay in the background you will have to give part of yourself over to the public domain.
pisces,You may not be as ambitious as some people but you have no end of dreams you would like to see come true. One dream more than most has your attention now, but is it a realistic dream or is it a fantasy dream? You need to decide.
pisces,What you have been doing is good but the way you have been doing it is bad and today’s full moon will in some way or other highlight that fact. It’s not too late to learn that the ends do not, as some fools claim, justify the means.
pisces,Stop blaming yourself for events over which you have no control. Because you are such an emotional person you tend to dwell on situations where people get hurt, even if it isn’t your fault. Instead or worrying, try helping in practical ways.
pisces,Your self-confidence may have taken a dive in recent weeks but when the Sun moves into your sign tomorrow you will get the lift you need and soon you will be soaring again. Think, feel and act positive in everything you do.
pisces,The Sun moves into your sign today and even if your birthday is not for some weeks yet you should go out and celebrate. The next few weeks will be extra special, so start making plans and believe, really believe, that your dreams will come true.
pisces,The Sun is moving through your sign and you’re feeling on top of the world, but today’s Mercury-Saturn link could dampen your mood a bit with some negative news. In the greater scheme of things, it’s of no real importance, so keep smiling. ,pisces,It may be true that the higher you climb the further you have to fall but don’t let that stop you aiming for the top of the mountain, or even the stars. Life is supposed to be an adventure, so put fear and doubt behind you and be who you were meant to be.
pisces,Most things are going your way at the moment but Saturn, planet of restriction, is still holding you back from following your dream. Take it as a sign that you are not yet ready to make that dream a reality. It will happen when the time is right.
pisces,The Sun joins forces with Neptune, your ruler, in your sign this weekend, which means that all your best Pisces qualities will come to the fore. You may not always be a saint but you have the potential to be one. Do good deeds for everyone.
pisces,Don’t listen to the doubters and the cynics – if there is something you want to do then just do it, no matter how foolhardy it seems to the world at large. This is a time for taking risks and pushing limits. You may find there are no limits.
pisces,This is very much your time of year – and a time to take risks. What happens around the time of the new moon on the 1st is sure to delight you but it will be so much better if you start making creative and romantic things happen now.
pisces,Success is yours if you want it enough but that begs the question: DO you want it enough? Pisces is often a laidback sort of sign, so maybe you are happy taking each day as it comes. If so, that’s okay – you are who you are.
pisces,You like to make bold decisions but with Jupiter and Uranus at odds today almost any decision you make is likely to have unforeseen consequences. With that fact in mind maybe you should just leave things alone for the next 24 hours.
pisces,Be assertive and let partners and colleagues and even employers know that you intend to put your own needs first. This is your time of year and you have every right and every reason to be a little bit selfish. It’s in a good cause!,pisces,Now that Mercury, planet of the mind, is ending its retrograde phase your self-belief will soar. And with both a new moon and a wonderful Sun-Jupiter link over the next 48 hours this really could be one of the weekends of the year. Enjoy!,pisces,A new moon in your birth sign promises a new beginning, and with Jupiter on your side too there is no way you can be anything less than amazing this weekend. There are no limits to what you can dream and what you can do. So do it!,pisces,Saturn, planet of limitation, will encourage you to think about your long-term plans. Are they realistic? Are they what you truly desire? Give it some thought and recognize that you don’t have to make a final decision any time soon. Take each day as it comes.
pisces,Pluto, planet of power, will help you not just change your life but transform it over the next 12 months. What is it you dream of doing? Who is it you dream of being? There is no excuse for leaving things as they are. Change yourself and change the world.
pisces,Your powers of persuasion will move to a higher level this year, enabling you to convince others that you know what you are talking about. Sooner or later, of course, your words will be put to the test, so don’t go making claims that may not be true.
pisces,If someone is in trouble today you will ride to their rescue with no questions asked. However, while it’s good of you to be generous with your time you must be careful about how you use your money. And remember, it is YOUR money.
pisces,You will get a fresh burst of energy today, enabling you to finish something you started a long time ago. Some people believe that Pisceans are lazy, that they don’t like to push themselves too hard. Time to prove them wrong.
pisces,Someone you are fond of has made a silly mistake and is feeling bad about it. They know what they did wrong, so don’t labor the point. Instead, give them an uplifting pep-talk and tell them to get on with it. It’s what they do next that counts.
pisces,Anyone who thinks you are too easygoing to get things done will be amazed by how dynamic you are over the next 48 hours. You won’t have time for or patience with those who drag their feet. The world turned upside-down!,pisces,Some of the risks you took recently were aimless and without meaning. Now you need to balance things out by being more responsible. Does that sound boring? Don’t worry, it won’t be – in fact you’ll have more fun than you know what to do with!,pisces,For best results over the coming 12 months plan well ahead and leave as few things as possible to chance. That might not sound like a recipe for fun but in a strange way you will enjoy being in control of your impulses. Maybe it’s because it’s all so unusual!,pisces,Be careful what you agree to over the next 24 hours because the planets warn you don’t have all the facts. Don’t accept what other people tell you simply because they look good and sound honest – it’s most likely part of the act.
pisces,Do something big and exciting with your life over the next 12 months. Time waits for no man and if you carry on drifting as you have been of late you may one day look back and regret not being more adventurous. What have you got to lose? Only your fear.
pisces,The Sun in your sign is protecting you from harm and with Saturn on your side as well today it’s as if you have some kind of force field around keeping negative ideas, and negative people, at bay. Think only good things about the world.
pisces,There are so many positive influences on your birthday this year that you can’t help but do something out of the ordinary over the next 12 months. It may or may not mean you make a million dollars but you will certainly make waves, and lots of new friends.
pisces,Because tomorrow’s full moon occurs in your opposite sign partners and loved ones and work colleagues may be a bit touchy over the next few days. Make sure you don’t react in kind. The moment you do it means they have won.
pisces,A full moon on your birthday means you will have to make the effort, each and every day, to keep your feelings on an even keel. For best results, take up meditation or some other activity that helps you keep your body, mind and emotions in harmony.
pisces,Now is the time to be open about your opinions. Now is the time to be ruthlessly honest. If you have things to say you must let everyone know what is on your mind. If you don’t speak up now you’ll be sorry about it later on.
pisces,Listen to your intuition and act on what it tells you. The more certain ideas insinuate their way into your mind the more likely it is they are pointing you in the direction that is uniquely right for you. You already know the answers, so listen to yourself.
pisces,The planets indicate that good news concerning your money situation will be coming your way over the next few days. You won’t, of course, get something for nothing but you will at least have more cash in your pocket. Spend it wisely.
pisces,This is a milestone birthday for you. You may or may not be at a significant age but the planets indicate that the next 12 months will be special, so special in fact that your life will change in ways that delight you. You’ll change too and very much for the better.
pisces,A question that has been nagging at your brain for such a long time will finally be answered today. It may surprise you how simple the solution is but isn’t that often the way? Next time, try not to make such a big deal of it.
pisces,What happens over the next few days will determine whether your dreams come true or whether they remain in the realms of wishful thinking. By all means plan long-term but act and react on a daily, hourly, even a minute-by-minute basis.
pisces,Let your heart rule your head over the next few days. Mercury in your sign makes you want to rationalize your feelings but sometimes it’s better to trust what comes from within, even if you can’t explain it in any rational way. ,pisces,You will most likely make a number of small gains over the next few days – which are then cancelled out by a number of small losses. Overall you won’t be out of pocket, so take the rough with the smooth and enjoy the journey.
pisces,It will pay you to be secretive about money matters today. According to the planets your rivals are on the lookout for opportunities to grow rich and if they can do so at your expense then so much the better. Stay sharp and don’t let it happen.
pisces,This is the perfect day to make promises and resolutions. Mercury, planet of the mind, is totally on your side at the moment, so decide what it is you desire and commit to making it yours. The universe will hear your pledge and respond favorably.
pisces,Something will happen today that makes you wonder if there is more going on behind the scenes than you suspected. Make it your business to find out why certain people are acting so strangely – and use what you discover for your own advantage.
pisces,Even if you are the kind of Pisces who does not like to rock the boat you will let certain people know where they have been going wrong. But don’t just say the words – show them in practical ways how they can make things right again.
pisces,There is no point getting worked up about your financial situation. The planets indicate that if you stay calm and think straight this weekend you can quite easily find a way out of the mess you are in. You may even end up making a profit.
pisces,You must be even-handed when dealing with loved ones this week. If you give even the slightest impression that you favor one person over another you could cause all sorts of emotional upsets. If you’ve got a favorite, don’t let it show. ,pisces,A little cooperation will go a long way today, especially as so many people seem to be looking for excuses to start a fight. Victory does not always go to the bravest or the brightest – sometimes it goes to those who get themselves organized.
pisces,You have some important personal issues to deal with, issues that won’t wait, so let your friends know they may be seeing less of you for a while. Get your emotional life in order first, then go out and have fun with your mates.
pisces,If you made a promise of some kind you must keep it. If you try to wriggle out of it now you will damage your reputation, maybe not beyond repair but certainly to the extent that certain people won’t trust you so easily again.
pisces,If you want something today there is every chance that someone will give it to you – but you have got to ask them directly. If you try dropping hints chances are they won’t understand, so spell it out for them in plain and simple language.
pisces,You will find it easy to see the good in other people today – and they in turn will realize what a special friend they have in you. You can’t love the whole world, of course, but the world has a special place in its heart for you.
pisces,You won’t find it hard to show your feelings this weekend. As Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign you will go out of your way to let others know how much you appreciate their efforts. Your love life is looking good too.
pisces,Someone you think of as a rival will take a tumble this week and you are perfectly placed to benefit. Being the nice person you are you may feel a bit sorry for them but don’t let that stop you from cashing in. You deserve some success.
pisces,Good news about your money situation will improve your mood no end today. That does not, however, mean you have an excuse to go on a spree. If you do come into extra cash you must use it to pay off what you still owe.
pisces,If someone needs your help today you will give it with no questions asked. However, after you have saved them yet again you should let them know you are tired of riding to the rescue all the time. They need to take responsibility for themselves.
pisces,If someone changes their plans at the very last moment today you may not be happy about it but you must not let it show. Breath deeply, count to twenty, then give them a big smile and say “no problem”. And never trust them again.
pisces,Try not to get angry or frustrated if a goal you are aiming to reach seems to be further away than ever. Just as there is a reason for everything that happens in life so too is there a reason for everything that does not happen.
pisces,You may have to take a detour of some kind today but that’s okay – you will reach your chosen destination eventually, so don’t be impatient. It’s what you see and hear and feel along the way that makes the journey worth taking.
pisces,If you have any skeletons in your closet – and you do, you do – the surest way to draw attention to them is to try to change the subject when the conversation gets too close to the truth for comfort. Be bold and brazen it out.
pisces,Use your intuition as well as your intellect this week, especially where money matters are concerned. No matter what the facts and figures might say if your sixth sense tells you something is not right you would be a fool not to listen.
pisces,No matter how self-reliant a Pisces you may be you must make an effort to work hand-in-hand with other people over the next few days. Not only will you get more done but you will create a lot of useful goodwill as well.
pisces,You may not be dishonest by nature but you will be tempted to cut corners in some way today – and that could be a big mistake. Any small gains you make by using underhand methods will be wiped out by big losses later on.
pisces,You seem to be a bit reckless of late and if yesterday’s eclipse somehow failed to remind you that’s not a good thing to be then today’s Mars-Mercury link most certainly will. Don’t ignore warnings from your subconscious mind.
pisces,Try not to commit yourself to anything new over the next 24 hours. A range of possibilities will open up for you between now and the start of next week, so conserve your energy and don’t get snowed under by even more responsibilities.
pisces,Sometimes you can be too much of a perfectionist and if you demand the best of other people today you may end up being disappointed. Everyone is different and everyone has their own way of doing things – but, of course, your way is best.
pisces,You are now perfectly placed to put the pressure on those who have been putting so much pressure on you. But that does not mean you should spend all your time getting your own back. The best revenge is being seen to have fun.
pisces,There may be a thousand and one things going on in your world but you should focus only on what makes you smile. Some people think life is so serious but you know it is nothing more than a big cosmic game – and games should be fun.
pisces,Decide what it is that you want to do today, then get on and do it. Chances are you’ll get a few dirty looks, and maybe a few bad words as well, from those who disagree with your aims but there’s nothing they can do to stop you.
pisces,It’s good that you like to work with other people but that does not mean they have the right to dictate to you what you should do and how you should do it. If you are part of a team there must be equality – make sure they know that.
pisces,Sometimes it’s good to get away from your duties and chores and lose yourself in activities you really enjoy. Such a time is now. Mind planet Mercury will make it easy for you to have a good time – not least because you no longer feel guilty about it.
pisces,Someone you meet socially will also attract you romantically but think carefully before you send out signals of love because the planets warn it may not be the right thing to do. Keep it on a friendly level, at least for the moment.
pisces,You will feel good about yourself today, thanks to the influence of Venus, planet of harmony, in your sign. Try to avoid work that may be strenuous, physically or mentally, because it’s unlikely that your heart will be in it.
pisces,You will be on the move this weekend, visiting new places and meeting new people. It’s not often you are this outgoing, so make the most of it and make sure you leave others smiling more when you say goodbye than when you say hello.
pisces,You will be extremely busy at work over the next few days and just as busy socially too and come the end of the week you will no doubt be exhausted. Know when you have reached your limits and reward yourself with a well-earned rest.
pisces,Anyone who thinks you lack the spirit of adventure will have to think again as cosmic activity in the most outgoing area of your chart inspires you to try so many new things. You may do too much but it’s better than doing too little.
pisces,The message of the stars today is that you need to stop wasting time on so many irrelevant activities. Your social life, especially, is becoming a drain on your energy, so cut back on the partying and all those unnecessary commitments.
pisces,Socially this will be a thoroughly enjoyable day but some of your friends may be angry that you are spending more time with new acquaintances than you are with them. They may have a point but you can’t help it if you’re so popular.
pisces,You will discover something about a friend or loved one that surprises you today – which just goes to show you can never be sure you really know another person. Resist the urge to pry any deeper – leave them a few secrets to enjoy.
pisces,You may be tempted to muddle through some kind of problem and hope it all comes right in the end, and maybe it will. But wouldn’t it be easier if you called on the help of an expert? Not even a Pisces can know or do it all.
pisces,You are about to embark on a more light-hearted phase, so try not to worry so much about money and, if the opportunity arises, don’t hesitate to hit the town with your friends. In a nutshell: if you’re not laughing you’re not doing it right.
pisces,If you recently made a promise, to an employer or somebody else in a position of power, then you must keep it. If you try to back out of the deal it will do your reputation a great deal of harm. Do what you said you would.
pisces,Keep your long-term goals at the forefront of your mind and don’t let anyone put you off your quest. So-called friends will come up with all sorts of reasons why you should think again but you must be true to your instincts.
pisces,You may have to give up something that means a lot to you but you won’t mind too much – in fact you may be secretly happy to see it go. You will be happier still if people just leave you alone for a while. You like your own company.
pisces,Steer clear of disputes that have nothing to do with you. The more others try to draw you into an argument the more you must keep your distance. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to friendships and money – they don’t mix.
pisces,Current cosmic activity endows you with extraordinary self-confidence but the downside is you might start thinking you cannot fail. Apply common sense to everything you do today and don’t let others pressure you into making quick decisions.
pisces,If you have something important to say you are advised to keep quiet about it until the early part of next week. The current Sun-Saturn link warns your words won’t be well received, either by loved ones or people in positions of power.
pisces,Don’t feel guilty about something you did not cause. Yes, the situation maybe a bit of an emotional train wreck but it’s not your fault certain people could not control their impulses. Do what you can to help but don’t take the blame.
pisces,You will be more inclined than usual to take risks. So long as they are calculated risks that’s fine – you will come to no harm and could even make some money – but if you act recklessly the fall could be spectacular. Your choice!,pisces,Travel is on the cards for today and tomorrow but so are hold-ups and unexpected diversions. The good news is that wherever you end up you’ll have a lot of fun, so don’t stay home and play safe – get out into the world.
pisces,Some things in life are important and some things in life are not. Do you know how to tell the difference? Today’s full moon will encourage people to get agitated about issues that are simply not worth the effort. Don’t be one of them.
pisces,Money matters and business affairs will go better today if you turn on the charm and let would-be partners know you are happy to work closely with them. There’s more than enough profit to go around, so don’t be greedy.
pisces,You must let partners and loved ones know what you will and will not put up with. One of the reasons there have been so may arguments of late is that some people have got the impression that you can be easily manipulated.
pisces,Make use of the Sun’s last few days in the most open and outgoing area of your chart to get out into the world and have some fun. No matter how many chores still need to be done they can wait. If it doesn’t make you smile then give it a miss.
pisces,Get back on good terms with someone you have drifted away from in recent months. Start by calling them up and inviting them out for a coffee. Soon you’ll be chatting away like long-lost friends – which, of course, is what you are.
pisces,You are sure to go over the top one way or another over the next 24 hours. Hopefully you will avoid the temptation to spend large sums of money on things you don’t really need. Even things you do need you may pay too much for.
pisces,You may have every right to get angry with someone who has let you down but you will make a better impression if you forgive and forget and act as if nothing important has occurred. In the greater scheme of things, it’s no big deal.
pisces,You may not be in the mood to put yourself out for other people right now but someone is desperately in need of your assistance and you’ll hate yourself in the long-term if you purposely ignore them. It’s your destiny to do good in the world.
pisces,The solution to a problem that has been causing you sleepless nights will pop into your head today and you will kick yourself mentally for not having seen it sooner. Never mind, now you know what to do – so do it.
pisces,Social activities are important, of course, but your home life is what you should be focusing on now. If there are problems in the domestic sphere it’s unlikely you will be happy in other areas, so look for solutions – you’ll find them.
pisces,Even if you are the kind of Pisces who prefers to keep a low profile you will be in the public eye over the next 48 hours – hopefully for the right reasons. This is also an excellent time for artistic activities, so let those creative juices flow.
pisces,There will be times over the next few days when it seems as if what is going on around you is illogical in the extreme. Maybe that’s true but more likely it means you are not in tune with the wider mood. It’s you who needs to adjust.
pisces,You are carrying quite a load at the moment and need to find someone who can help take the strain. The good news is there are a number of people you have done favors for who would like nothing better than to return the compliment.
pisces,Things may be a bit tense on the home front at the moment but over the next two or three days you will get the opportunity to find out why loved ones are so uptight. Once you know that it will be quite easy to restore harmony.
pisces,You need to be more open about your feelings, especially if you are the kind of Pisces who tends to keep your emotions bottled up inside. Every now and then it is good to let things out, to release the pressure so you don’t explode!,pisces,Don’t worry that others might think less of you if you ease off a bit, worry only that if you don’t take better care of yourself you might come to harm. The planets urge you to take things at a slower pace for a while.
pisces,There is a lot of gossip flying about at the moment and there is a danger it could damage your credibility. You must speak up and let others know that what is being said about you is not remotely true. You’re just not that bad.
pisces,All experience is good experience and what happens over the next 48 hours will teach you that even when things go wrong they often go right in some way too. What looks like a loss or a setback now could be a blessing in disguise later on.
pisces,You may be hurting inside but don’t let it show. Put on a brave face, go out and have fun and chances are it won’t be long before you are smiling again. What you think of as “good” and “bad” are often simply a matter of perspective.
pisces,Spell out in plain and simple language what it is you expect of other people. Both at home and at work misunderstandings are likely today, so take your time and make sure everyone knows what they are supposed to be doing.
pisces,Your feelings will be rather intense over the next 24 hours but it need not be an uncomfortable experience. If you prefer to live more through your heart than your head that’s quite all right. Nothing bad will come of it.
pisces,You may not be much in the mood for serious things at the moment but that’s okay. Do what you have to do as quickly as possible, then devote yourself to activities that bring a smile to your face. Life should be about fun, not work.
pisces,Your world will be rocked by what happens over the next few days but later you will look back and realize it was all for the best. Ultimately all change is good for you, so go with the flow and learn equally from success and failure.
pisces,You need to be a bit more adventurous when it comes to your finances. What worked for you in the past may not work as well for you now, so look ahead and find new ways to boost your earning power and your bank balance.
pisces,There is no point trying to change too much today because the upcoming full moon will most likely change them back again. All you can do is go with the flow and trust that in time you will regain the advantage you seem to have lost.
pisces,If you are having second thoughts about taking on a new responsibility you will have to explain yourself to those who thought it was all decided. You may not want to let them down but it’s becoming increasingly likely you may have to.
pisces,Don’t waste your time and energy looking for complicated solutions to what are really quite simple problems. Sometimes you read too much into what is taking place around you and that could well be the case over the next 24 hours.
pisces,You may want to come and go as you please but Saturn, planet of limitation, won’t let you. It seems there is something you need to do before you are allowed to make your getaway. What might it be? Give it some thought – then act.
pisces,The more certain people complain that you are making life difficult for them the more certain you can be that you are doing the right thing. Ultimately, of course, it’s not about making things difficult for them but making things easier for you.
pisces,There are a lot of things going on behind the scenes at the moment and with tomorrow’s new moon adding to the mix you could find yourself involved in all sorts of plots and conspiracies. Make a point of taking none of it too seriously.
pisces,Resist the temptation to tell an employer or senior colleague what you really think of them today – it won’t work out right. If you cannot say something nice then it might be wise to say nothing at all. Think of your future.
pisces,A feud that has been simmering in secret will erupt into open warfare over the weekend and you have no choice but to make it a fight to the finish. Don’t bother trying to compromise – they’ll see that as a sign of weakness.
pisces,Once the Sun moves into the sympathetic sign of Cancer on the 21st a whole new world of possibilities will open up for you, but between now and then you would be wise to relax both physically and mentally. There’s no need to rush.
pisces,You have so much to look forward to – so why are you still looking back and lamenting what might have been? Whatever the reason you need to snap out of it or you may not even notice new opportunities. Be positive – and smile more!,pisces,A friend is clearly being economical with the truth and no doubt that makes you mad. Before you snap at them ask yourself what their motive might be. Maybe they think they are protecting you. Maybe they think you can’t handle the truth.
pisces,Someone you meet on your travels today or tomorrow is destined to play a major role in your life over the next few months. Try not to be too defensive when meeting someone for the first time. Chances are your fates are somehow entwined.
pisces,Once again you are worrying about things you have no way of changing. According to the planets though what you fear the most is the one thing that is least likely to happen, so be brave and go on the attack. You’ll win.
pisces,Fate will take its chosen path no matter what you may think about it, so go with the flow and adapt to what happens rather than try to fight it. One of the best times of the year is about to begin, so you really have nothing to fear.
pisces,The Sun’s entry into the most dynamic area of your chart today is sure to bring a smile to your face. More importantly, it will make you believe that happiness and success are yours by right and not because others choose to give them to you.
pisces,Life is too short to waste time worrying about things that may never happen. Now that the Sun is moving through the most creative area of your chart you can and you must be more decisive and dynamic. Go for it – and make it happen.
pisces,You may not agree with what a friend or family member is going to do but they have made up their mind about it so you might as well give them your support. According to the planets it will all work out well in the end.
pisces,If you know what it is you want and if you act quickly and decisively you are sure to accomplish great things. Someone in a position of authority thinks you are special and they will think you are even more special after today!,pisces,Sometimes it is better to back off from a fight and with Mars opposing Uranus today this is definitely one of them. Let others argue the toss and put the world to rights – your talents are better suited to loving and laughing.
pisces,The approaching new moon falls in the most dynamic area of your chart, so you won’t hesitate to take advantage of what happens over the next few days. Just remember that some things matter and some things do not. Use your energy wisely.
pisces,Today’s new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart endows you with so much confidence and so much energy. Whatever you put your mind to will be a success. But don’t do too much and spread yourself too thin. Be selective.
pisces,The Sun in Cancer at this time of year makes you hugely creative, so do something out of the ordinary over the next 48 hours, something that cannot fail to get you noticed. It won’t be long before your name is up in lights.
pisces,If there are any doubts in your mind about what you are planning to do they will be gone by the middle of the week. The planets will get you thinking more deeply than usual about your lifestyle and, more specifically, about your relationships.
pisces,Over the next two or three days the planets will bring to a head issues that you have been trying to avoid. Once you realize you can no longer run away from them you will have to look for solutions – and there will be plenty.
pisces,It’s not often you reveal your darkest secrets but you will be tempted to do so today. Is that such a good idea? Some things are not meant to be shared, not even if you are desperate to cleanse your conscience. Forgive yourself and move on.
pisces,Your confidence seems to be making a return now that mind planet Mercury is no longer such a negative influence, and by the end of the week you will be the life and soul of the party again. Welcome back – we’ve missed you.
pisces,Feelings you have been keeping hidden inside you will burst out for the whole world to see today and, yes, it will be a bit embarrassing. But better to be embarrassed than to go on pretending you don’t care. You always care.
pisces,For some strange reason you seem to be afraid of your own shadow – even though most things in your life are going well. Don’t let fear hold you back from doing something creative today. Once you get started your confidence will return.
pisces,You need to strike a workable balance this weekend between protecting your own interests and not being too greedy. What you, and everyone else, need to understand is that there is more than enough to go around. There always is.
pisces,Don’t let fear of the unknown hold you back over the next seven days. The planets indicate you won’t have to face anything worse than you have faced before, and you’re still here and thriving, aren’t you? So why worry?,pisces,If an issue is causing you sleepless nights the best way to deal with it is to focus your mind on something else for a while. Eventually you may find that you no longer care who wins and who loses. It’s just not important.
pisces,You need to get your act together and get something started today. If you don’t you may spend the rest of the year kicking yourself for being too slow and too cautious. Don’t be afraid of change – change is your friend and ally.
pisces,The message of the stars is that you must finish what you started. If you give up on a project now you will regret it later in the year when you realize how close you were to success. You’re actually doing very well, so stay the course.
pisces,With both the Sun and Jupiter moving through the most dynamic area of your chart there is precious little you cannot do now, but you will do it better if you are part of a team. It’s always more fun when there’s more than one.
pisces,There is no point worrying about things over which you have no control. The good news is that even if the worst does happen today it won’t be as bad as you fear. Even if you lose out you will still win in some way.
pisces,The current cosmic climate will play havoc with everyone’s plans over the next 48 hours, so take life as it comes and don’t expect too much of anyone, including yourself. When little things do go right it will be a pleasant surprise.
pisces,Jupiter, planet of expansion, moves into the most practical area of your chart this week, so focus on everyday matters and make sure that each and every time you exert yourself you balance it with plenty of rest. Your health is important.
pisces,If you respect other people they will respect you – it’s as simple as that. If, however, you say or do things that others find offensive you can expect some kind of backlash. As with each and every other issue in your life, the choice is your own.
pisces,All things are possible if you want them enough and if you believe in yourself. If you can keep that thought at the forefront of your mind today you might just accomplish something out of the ordinary because you are anything but ordinary.
pisces,You will be back to your best in a matter of days but today you must make peace with anyone you have fallen out with. Maybe you were a little harsh on them. Maybe you should have been more forgiving. So forgive them now.
pisces,The cosmic omens are so good for you at the moment that you no doubt think you can do as you please. To a certain extent that is true but you should do things for other people as well. Neptune, your ruler, urges you to be charitable.
pisces,You will feel SO affectionate today – you’re in love with the whole wide world. It won’t last, of course, but while it does see how many good deeds you can do for friends, relatives and even strangers. You’ll make such a difference.
pisces,If you allow others to distract you today you will get very little done and that would be a shame. You have so much going for you now. There are so many opportunities. You cannot afford to be sidetracked by petty issues and petty people.
pisces,There are plenty of good things going on in the world around you, so why are you feeling so down? Your task for the week ahead is to get out and about and get more involved in social activities. Life is what you choose to make of it.
pisces,If someone you trust offers you advice today you would be wise to listen, even if it is not what you were hoping to hear. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to property matters, investments and other joint financial issues.
pisces,You may be a creature of habit but you are also capable of adapting to changes and that’s just as well because something is sure to disrupt your routine today. Go with the flow chances are it will take you somewhere good.
pisces,If someone says something hurtful about you today don’t take it too seriously. Most likely they are just having a bad day and need to let off steam. You will be friends again tomorrow and they will strive to make it up to you.
pisces,The cosmic powers that be will never ask you to do more than you are capable of, so don’t worry if the assignment you have taken on looks huge – you WILL find a way to ace it. You don’t know how strong you are – yet.
pisces,The more someone tries to coerce you into doing something you are not certain is in your best interests the more you must resist. If you stick to your guns and refuse to play ball they will get the message that you cannot be intimidated.
pisces,Don’t make a big issue of what you are expected to do this weekend. Yes, of course, it’s a pain but the planets promise if you make a good job of it you will do your reputation no harm at all. Take pride in your work.
pisces,You will be in a more carefree mood than you have been for quite some time, thanks in no small part to Venus, planet of affection and harmony, moving through the most positive area of your chart. In a nutshell: love more and worry less.
pisces,Money worries and career issues seem to be taking up a lot of your time and energy at the moment but you know from past experience it will all come right in the end – it almost always does. A positive attitude is a must, today and every day.
pisces,Let loved ones make their own decisions for a change. Too often in the past you have done everything for them and it has got to the stage where they expect it of you. That’s not good for you or for them, so break the cycle.
pisces,If a friend or work colleague says something hurtful don’t take it to heart. On the contrary, you should take it as a sign that you are on the right track. They obviously feel threatened, so keep doing what you’re doing, only more so!,pisces,It may annoy you that a friend or work colleague insists on everything being done their way but if you are smart you will go along with them. If it’s a success you will share in the glory. If it’s a failure it’s entirely their fault.
pisces,If you are planning a surprise for a loved one this coming weekend be careful who you confide in because this is one of those days when information could easily slip out. You don’t want to spoil what should be a fun event.
pisces,You may be tempted to retreat into your shell and refuse to join in with social activities this weekend but that would be a shame. The planets indicate you have a lot to offer and it just won’t be the same without you involved.
pisces,Believe it or not there is a large luck factor working in your favor at the moment but you won’t notice it of you keep worrying about petty issues. Details must be allowed to take care of themselves. Raise your sights and raise your game.
pisces,You will be bombarded with advice from every direction today and a lot of it will be contradictory. Chances are you can learn from what others are telling you but first you will need to filter the good advice from the garbage.
pisces,Be positive and believe in yourself – then act decisively. The current cosmic picture makes it easy for you to boost both your status and your earning power, but it won’t just happen as if by magic – the effort must come from you.
pisces,Others may say that you have got something all wrong but you must not allow them to change your opinion. Just because you are in the minority at the moment does not mean you are wrong. You’ve never been one to follow the herd.
pisces,Something will get under your skin to such an extent today that you may get a bit fanatical about it. Yes, of course, it is interesting and yes, of course, it is important but don’t shout and scream about it or you will turn people off.
pisces,You may be the sort who spends more time dreaming than doing but today the planets will inspire you to take a more hands-on approach. Anything of a practical nature will go well for you, so get your act together and get things done.
pisces,A wonderful idea will occur to you this weekend and you won’t be satisfied until you have done something with it. Don’t worry that it does not seem “logical” because you have more than five senses. Do what your inner voice tells you.
pisces,Changes in your working routine may not be to your liking but they will eventually work in your favor, so don’t try to stop them. Progress will come whether you want it to or not, so be smart and move with the forces of change.
pisces,A dispute that has been going on for as long as you can remember is getting tedious, so make this the day when you switch off from it and do something more interesting. Differences will always exist but you can pretend that they don’t.
pisces,Only you can decide if a relationship is worth carrying on with but you don’t have to decide right now. The planets indicate there are still a few twists and turns and surprises to come, so stay calm and don’t do anything rash.
pisces,Some things are worth fighting about but others are not and over the next few days you will need to get serious about where you draw the line. Fight only for what you truly believe in. Better still, find ways to win without fighting at all.
pisces,A robust set of influences will make you somewhat vocal over the next 48 hours and that’s good. You should never be shy about putting across your point of view, especially when you know it’s the right view. Speak up, loudly.
pisces,Think before you act, especially if your actions could have a knock-on effect on those around you. Cosmic activity in you opposite sign of Virgo means you must take other people’s needs and desires into account. ,pisces,You may want to back out of some kind of joint activity but if you do there are sure to be consequences. Before you make the fateful cut try to find ways you can make it work. If you can’t see any, try looking harder!,pisces,Yes, of course, you should turn the other cheek and forgive those who have spoken or acted in ways that hurt you, but you must also let them know that you won’t be so forgiving next time. Your good nature can be abused only so far.
pisces,You must be totally honest today, even if what you have to say is not what colleagues and loved ones want to hear. Don’t worry about their reactions – worry about how guilty you will feel if you keep quiet and it all goes wrong.
pisces,Focus only on things that excite you physically and emotionally over the next few days. There will, of course, be those who say you are expecting too much of yourself but, on the contrary, if anything you are not expecting enough.
pisces,Sometimes you can be rather stubborn and that could be a problem today if you refuse to abandon an idea that clearly is no longer worth defending. Times change and you should be big enough and smart enough to change with them.
pisces,Mercury, planet of the mind, links with power planet Pluto today, so whatever you focus on will go from idea to reality quicker than you expected. Make sure your thoughts are positive and make sure they are always under your control.
pisces,You now have the power to turn even negative situations to your advantage and if you are smart you will use it to the full. You will achieve even more, of course, if you partner up with like-minded people. Together you’ll sparkle.
pisces,Changes you made to your working routine will pay off over the next few days. You will certainly have more time to spend with family and friends. The Sun’s change of signs urges you to focus on the important things, not least your own happiness.
pisces,Resistance of one kind or another is to be expected now the Sun is moving through your opposite sign but Monday’s new moon will help you overcome any differences you may have with friends or colleagues. Remember, you’re on the same side.
pisces,Let family and friends know how much you care for them. With the Sun, Moon and Mercury in the relationship area of your chart youwill find it easy to say the things that bring smiles to their faces, and that’s always good to see.
pisces,You may want nothing more than to pack a bag and get away from it all for a while but the fact is you have duties and responsibilities that demand your attention. See to them now and come the weekend you can make your getaway at last.
pisces,You may feel obliged to favor one thing over another but is it really for the best? The planets indicate you have been pushed in that direction by people who have a vested interest in what you do. Make choices for yourself, not for them.
pisces,Others may say you are not being serious enough about what’s going on in the world but you are under no obligation to feel guilty about things you did not cause. The world would be a better place if others were more like you.
pisces,If you feel that certain things need changing then you must make those changes yourself. It may make you unpopular with those who want things to stay as they are but you’ve never been the type to worry about what others think.
pisces,You have so many good ideas but you can’t seem to make a serious start on any of them. Maybe that’s your problem, maybe you are trying to do too many things. Put all your energy into the one thing that matters most this week. ,pisces,Some people take it for granted that they can get what they need from you any time they want. Why? Because that’s the impression you have given them by being too soft. It’s time to get tough. Go on, you can do it if you try.
pisces,You don’t lack for confidence but just lately you seem to have been missing the essential ingredient of luck that every successful person needs. Don’t worry: what happens over the next few days will be very much to your benefit.
pisces,Make an effort to see things from another person’s point of view today. You may be surprised to find that the way they look at the world is not that far away from your own. Differences are rarely more than skin deep.
pisces,What happens today will encourage you to question something you have always taken for granted. Stand back and look at the situation with an unbiased eye and don’t be afraid to change both your thinking and your long-term plans.
pisces,Love planet Venus in your opposite sign will bring relationship issues to the fore, but in a nice way. If you are single it’s quite possible you will get together with someone compatible over the weekend. Try not to scare them away!,pisces,Don’t put all your eggs in one basket this weekend because there is a very good chance you will lose them all. Spread your time and your energy and, most importantly, your money, in several directions. Overall you’ll gain more than you lose.
pisces,Many of the decisions you make in life are based on intuition rather than reason and that’s okay because it seems to work for you. Sometimes though you need to be strictly logical and that’s where you are now. You must use your head.
pisces,A certain person may seem likable and trustworthy but if your instincts tell you to be careful you should know better than to go against them. The reason for your inner uneasiness will become clear over the next few days.
pisces,Today’s Venus-Neptune link suggests you are likely to lose focus and start wandering around with no idea what direction you should be heading. No change there then! Actually it doesn’t matter – fate will always guide you where you need to go.
pisces,You may not be in the least bit interested what someone is trying to tell you but if you are smart you will listen and nod your head wisely at the appropriate moments. You need to keep in with this person, even of they secretly bore you.
pisces,You need to give up on a personal vendetta. Even if you are 10 per cent in the right and your enemy is 100 per cent in the wrong it doesn’t matter – confrontations like this are not worth it. Let it go – you’ll feel better for it.
pisces,As Mars moves into the career area of your chart this weekend you will come under pressure from people who have a great deal of influence. Rise to the occasion and make an effort to impress them. You can never have too many powerful allies.
pisces,What seems so obvious to you is obviously difficult for someone else to grasp, so take time out of your busy schedule and help them “get it”. They will appreciate the effort you make on their behalf. Maybe one day they’ll explain something to you. ,pisces,You need to resolve a dispute with a loved one or work colleague and you need to do it right now. If you let the situation fester for even one more day it may move beyond the point where it is easily rescued. Say sorry, and move on.
pisces,There are so many serious things going on around you at the moment that others are unlikely to be in the mood for fun and games. That’s okay, you can entertain yourself well enough. You’re certainly not going to join in all the doom and gloom!,pisces,Neptune, your ruler, is linked with mind planet Mercury today, so your brain will be buzzing with big ideas. But are they practical ideas? For best results you should limit yourself to one or two objectives you know you can easily reach.
pisces,You know what you want and you know how to get it. So what are you waiting for? The time is right to make your bid for fame and fortune, so don’t hold back a moment longer: show the world you’re a force to be reckoned with.
pisces,The best way to deal with a negative situation is to ignore it. No, really. The more you focus on what’s going wrong the longer it will stick around, so starve it of the oxygen of attention and see how fast it shrinks in importance.
pisces,Be careful what you say today because certain people will take you seriously, maybe more seriously than you intended. On the work front especially don’t give rivals a stick with which they can beat you. Sometimes you’re your own worst enemy.
pisces,No doubt there are certain individuals you would like to be on better terms with but would that really change things? Probably not. The real problem is that you don’t stand up for yourself enough. It’s time to get tough. Bite back.
pisces,An issue you had either forgotten about or you thought had been resolved will return to annoy you today and this time you have got to deal with it effectively. Show those who doubt it that you can be decisive. Make your call and make it happen.
pisces,No matter what you do over the next 24 hours you are sure to tread on someone’s toes and get criticized for it. No matter. Better to be clumsy and get noticed than to make all the right moves and fail to make an impression.
pisces,No matter what problems you may have faced in recent weeks they are just about played out and after today won’t trouble you again. No doubt a celebration is in order but don’t go mad and spend all your money – keep plenty in reserve.
pisces,The planets suggest you are about to make a momentous decision, the kind that could change the whole course of your life. But are you making it for the right reasons? Make sure you answer that question honestly before taking the next step.
pisces,Someone you live or work with will be irritable in the extreme over the next 24 hours. There is no point trying to reason with them or cheer them up because the fact is they enjoy being negative. Just stay out of their way as much as you can.
pisces,It may be true that the world is changing quicker by the day but that does not mean you should slavishly follow each new fashion. Some things about the old ways are still worth keeping, so don’t be afraid to swim against the tide.
pisces,If you feel a bit down as the new week begins you should get involved in some kind of charity or social work. Seeing other people’s problems will put your own in perspective – and you’ll feel good about yourself because you can help.
pisces,Sometimes you can be too generous for your own good and cosmic activity in the wealth area of your chart warns you need to keep an eye on your finances. Help people out if you can but don’t ruin yourself in the process.
pisces,There will be moments today when you wonder if your efforts are truly appreciated but don’t let the apparent indifference of friends and loved ones get you down. Maybe they are just too busy to think about anything but their own needs.
pisces,You may not be able to make much sense of what is taking place around you but that does not matter. The important thing is that you are clear in your mind what it is you are trying to do. Outer confusion must yield to inner composure.
pisces,Act on the assumption that there is no such thing as chance. If something unusual happens today there is sure to be a reason for it and your job is to find out what it is. Why? Simply because it’s fun to be in the know.
pisces,Say what you mean over the next 24 hours but be extremely careful how you say it. With Mercury about to start one of its retrograde phases if others don’t like your tone of voice you could find you have made unnecessary enemies.
pisces,You may want to end the woes of the world but you are smart enough to realize it isn’t going to happen. What you can do though is change yourself. Change your own life for the better in some small way and others will follow your lead.
pisces,According to the planets you may be feeling a bit sorry for yourself at the moment. You need to snap out of it because there are all sorts of great opportunities heading your way and if you are drowning in tears you may miss them.
pisces,You may dislike having to admit that you were wrong about something but if you can’t bring yourself to do it now the lunar eclipse in midweek will make your error look even worse. So you made a mistake – so what? Accept it and move on.
pisces,There is no doubt at all that you will survive the stormy patch you are going through. It may at times seem as if the world is coming apart at the seams but from a higher perspective things have never been better. Trust more and smile more.
pisces,The winds of fate are blowing you in a new direction and all you have to do is relax and go with them. It may be a bit scary as you have no idea where you will end up, but wherever it is the planets indicate you’ll do okay.
pisces,Your imagination could easily run away with you today, especially if you are having second thoughts about a long-term project, but don’t let yourself get too detached from reality. Overall everything is still moving in the right direction, so lighten up.
pisces,You won’t escape a difficult situation by running away from it, so be brave and face up to whatever emotional challenge is in front of you. Chances are when you look it squarely in the face you will see there was nothing to fear in the first place.
pisces,Someone who envies your abilities has been trying to make life difficult for you in recent weeks and will be at it again over the next 48 hours. Ignore them. Pretend they don’t exist. The world will only take them seriously if you take them seriously.
pisces,The joy you get out of a relationship far outweighs the annoying things that sometimes come with it, so don’t you dare think of calling it a day. Deep down you share an almost spiritual attachment. End it and you’ll harm a part of yourself as well. ,pisces,Someone who should know you better has got it into their head that you no longer like them and that is why they are behaving so erratically at the moment. Do whatever it takes to ease their fears. You’re still friends and always will be.
pisces,Financial security may be uppermost in your mind at the moment but there are other things you need to take into consideration. One is how much extra work you will have to do for that extra cash you need. Don’t run yourself into the ground.
pisces,Money and career matters are under good stars at the moment and if there are changes you need to make now is the time to get the ball rolling. Take the initiative and make sure everyone can see you have not only talent but ambition too.
pisces,Something that has been a bit of a mystery will no longer nag at you as from today. Once the mystery has gone the fear and worry that came with it will disappear as well. Don’t be embarrassed that you made such a fuss over nothing. It happens.
pisces,The planets warn you will have to make sacrifices in your social life today and over the weekend if you are to make progress in more serious areas. On the work front especially aim to do more than your rivals – a lot more.
pisces,The Sun’s change of signs this week means you must be true to your principles, even if you are the only one who believes in them! You may be easygoing but there are some things you will never compromise, for money, love or anything else.
pisces,Life may be a bit unpredictable at the moment but that’s one of the things that makes it so interesting. The planets warn you need to embrace the unknown and accept that even unsettling events have their place in the cosmic plan.
pisces,The most important thing today is that you believe in yourself one hundred per cent. If you let any kind of doubt creep into your mind you will set up mental and emotional barriers that limit your success. All things are possible, for you anyway.
pisces,If you approach a long-standing problem from an unusual angle you will resolve it with ease. Tomorrow’s eclipse in your fellow Water sign of Scorpio encourages you to open your mind to new possibilities, which must inevitably lead to new solutions.
pisces,You may not have enjoyed the past few weeks as much as some people but you have to admit you learned some valuable lessons. Now you will get the chance to apply what you have learned in a much more favorable atmosphere. Have fun!,pisces,There were times in recent weeks when your mood was a bit gloomy but now everything is sweetness and light again and you can’t help but be delighted with life. Make it your business today to help those who are still trapped in the darkness.
pisces,Someone you are close to has had a brilliant idea but they need your input to get it off the ground. Let your mind roam freely this weekend and let them know how you think they should develop it. Together you can create a masterpiece.
pisces,Neptune, your ruler, governs insight and inspiration, and those are traits you will have plenty of during the early part of the week. You will also have more love in your life than usual, as romance planet Venus is strong as well. Enjoy! ,pisces,The reason you feel stuck at the moment is because you don’t have a clear idea what it is you are aiming for. Your first and, if necessary, your only task today is to identify your goal and draw up a plan that will take you to it.
pisces,Don’t worry too much about how you are going to do what has to be done, just greet the day with a smile and let your intuition guide you. This is one of the best times of the year for you, so try not to make it unnecessarily complicated.
pisces,If your instincts tell you not to ask too many questions then you will have no one but yourself to blame if you hear something you don’t much like. Sometimes it is better to know too little than too much and this is one of them.
pisces,Someone you have not seen for a while will come back into your life either today or tomorrow and the effect on your feelings could be quite dramatic. Don’t get carried away though – they’ve changed a lot, and so have you.
pisces,Your sixth sense is telling you that something is going on, and it’s something that you should know about. Do a little digging this weekend but keep what you find to yourself for now. You’re good at keeping secrets too.
pisces,The closer you get to Thursday’s full moon the more the emotional temperature will rose, but now you know that you can make a conscious effort not to get involved in senseless disputes. You have better things to do with your time and energy.
pisces,There are times when you take too much for granted and the planets warn this could be one of them. You may think you can get away with neglecting some kind of duty or chore but if you do the consequences could be dire. Get it done. ,pisces,The planets warn that your critical faculties are not what they should be at the moment, so try not to get too excited if certain people make you remarkable offers. It’s highly unlikely they are in a position to deliver. ,pisces,Today’s full moon indicates that you are torn between opposing options, unable to decide which is the right way to go. Toss a coin if you have to but be sure to choose a path and stick to it. Any way is better than no way at all.
pisces,Yesterday’s full moon swept away barriers and restrictions and now there is nothing to stop you surging forward again. Let your instincts guide you and don’t be afraid to move in a completely new direction. Wherever you go you’ll have loads of fun.
pisces,Don’t let a minor falling out spoil what should be an exciting week. Whatever your differences with a friend or loved one may be you can overcome them, or at least ignore them. You’re having too much fun to take life too seriously.
pisces,You will get the chance to tackle an issue that has been worrying you for months. Most likely a friend will offer to help you out and if you are smart you will accept. They know what you are going through – and what needs to be done.
pisces,What activity inspires you the most? Then why are you not doing it? At this time of year more than most you should be expanding your creative reach and moving in new directions. There are no limits, at least not for you. ,pisces,It’s okay to change your opinion in the light of new information and with mind planet Mercury strong in your chart you will find it easy to update your views. But don’t change every few hours – you’ve got to believe in something long-term.
pisces,Today’s Venus-Saturn link means you can easily patch things up with a friend or loved one. Sometimes a relationship can benefit from a dispute, especially if it clears the air. You’ll be the best of buddies again come tomorrow.
pisces,If a friend proposes something a little bit out of the ordinary today it might be wise to hold back from getting involved. This is one of those occasions when what seems like such a great idea turns out to be nothing of the sort.
pisces,You may have no reason to disbelieve what someone tells you but if you dig a little deeper you will discover that certain facts and figures do not add up. The more they urge you to trust them the more you should be on your guard.
pisces,Whatever else you do or don’t do over the next seven days you must finish what you started. Make use of the Sun’s final days in your fellow Water sign of Scorpio to bring a creative project to a successful conclusion. Get it done – now.
pisces,Your daydreams could get you into trouble today, especially if you take them too seriously. Some things are meant to be acted on and some things are meant to remain in fantasy land. Keep your imagination under control over the next 24 hours.
pisces,Be smart and introduce new methods into your daily routine. If you can do that then what you feared would take days or even weeks to complete can be dealt with in a matter of hours, leaving you more time to do what you really enjoy.
pisces,It may at times seem as if you are the only one who thinks logically but something will convince you today that you are not alone, that others share your values and opinions. Even if they don’t it doesn’t matter – you’re right and that’s it,pisces,If there is something you want to say then now is the time to say it. It does not matter how many people your words may offend, you have a duty to tell the truth as you see it – and the fact is you see it better than most.
pisces,You may feel you don’t have what it takes to fill a certain role but that isn’t true and with the Sun and moon highlighting the career area of your chart this weekend you really must have more confidence in yourself. Don’t think, just go for it. ,pisces,The best way to approach a work problem is to act as if it is not a problem at all. A confrontational attitude will only cause more discord, so pretend that everything is sweetness and light and, in time, maybe it will be.
pisces,It may be tempting to confront someone who has been giving you a hard time but the planets warn you should leave it until later in the week. Mercury’s change of signs on Friday is the signal to speak up – and answer back.
pisces,You know exactly what needs to be said or done to restore harmony at home or at work, so get on with it. The people you have fallen out with want to get things back to normal too, so make the first move and let them respond. ,pisces,You may be convinced that you are in the right about something but the planets warn you should not push your case too hard over the next 24 hours. If others can’t see the truth then they are the ones most likely to suffer for it.
pisces,Someone is clearly determined to make your life difficult but you won’t overcome them by direct confrontation. Find ways you can influence their behavior in more subtle ways. Is there something you know about them you can use as a lever? ,pisces,What happens today will give you the sense of perspective you have been lacking in recent weeks. You may have to admit, if only to yourself, that a wrong turning has been taken. It’s no big deal – the journey matters more than the destination.
pisces,You may be eager to push ahead with a new plan or project but it seems not everyone shares your enthusiasm. Should that worry you? No it should not. In fact on this occasion it is probably better if you travel alone. ,pisces,It may be the case that someone is holding back information and not letting you in on what you need to know. You are well aware who that someone is, the question is: what are you going to do about it? Find out the details from another source.
pisces,You like to do things to help other people and you will get the opportunity today. However, with mind planet Mercury at odds with your ruler Neptune make sure those you help really are in need, and not just faking it! ,pisces,The Sun in Sagittarius has a tendency to make you fret about your career but there is really no need. Whatever changes may be happening in your working environment they will be good for you in the long-term, so quit worrying.  ,pisces,What are your expectations? Are they realistic? It is important that you think about these questions because over the next few days your goals are sure to be challenged. Don’t be afraid to change them if they don’t come up to scratch.
pisces,What occurs over the next 24 hours will remind you that not everything in life is as permanent or predictable as you might like it to be. That may sound ominous but don’t worry – changes will be very much to your liking. ,pisces,Most likely you will exchange a few heated words with someone today and the bad feeling will continue through the weekend. But it’s no big deal. Full moons have a way of raising tensions and it will all be over come the start of next week. ,pisces,If it annoys you that someone seems determined to get you involved in an issue you have no real interest in then maybe you should be blunt and tell them to give it a rest. You are under no obligation to support their cause.
pisces,Honesty is not only the best policy for the upcoming week, it is the only policy if you are to earn the trust of other people. Don’t worry that what you have to say may sound harsh or ungrateful, just say it and welcome the consequences.
pisces,You may be one of the more sensitive members of the zodiac but you can be tough when the occasion calls for it, and it will call for it today. On the work front especially others will get the message that you’re not such a wimp after all. ,pisces,You need to deal with a situation that has been bothering you for several weeks. It may require you to make a decision that is in some way final (and that scares you) but what can you do when the alternative is more sleepless nights? ,pisces,Put your worries behind you and have fun with your friends. Some people, inevitably, will say you are neglecting your responsibilities but you can safely ignore them. You desperately need to take a break – and few would dispute you deserve it.
pisces,The more others say that what you are trying to do is impossible the more determined you will be to prove them wrong. Your confidence may waver a bit towards the end of the day but by then you should have reached your goal. ,pisces,You don’t have to pretend that a certain task comes easy to you when, in fact, it is a major struggle. No one expects you to get it right the first time, so do your best and be pleased with that. Others will be pleased with you too. ,pisces,Whatever you are working on this weekend you are advised to pace yourself sensibly because if you get carried away and move too fast you could run out of steam before the project is finished. There’s no rush, so don’t impose unnecessary deadlines.
pisces,The planets warn you need to be careful where money and business matters are concerned. You should be especially cautious about what profits you can expect. You know the old saying: don’t count your chickens before they have hatched.
pisces,A rival will throw down a challenge today and if you are smart you will pick it up and throw it right back at them. Most likely they will be so surprised that they immediately back off. If they don’t, you must back up your words with action. ,pisces,You may have to react to a series of minor crises today. Eventually it will dawn on you that most of them are of your own making, but will you wise up before you have wasted an entire day’s worth of time and energy? ,pisces,Anyone who dares to disagree with you today is going to wish they had kept their opinions to themselves. You are in no mood to listen to criticism, not even from those whose input you value. You know what you are doing. ,pisces,You won’t find it hard to persuade partners and colleagues to follow your lead today but make sure it is persuade – not force. If you push others in directions they don’t want to go they will drag their feet and kick up an embarrassing fuss. ,pisces,You can use your power to force someone to do your bidding today, or you can use your charm to persuade them to cooperate. It’s up to you which you choose but common sense says the latter is likely to be less problematic.
pisces,If you make a wish over the next 48 hours there is every chance that it will come true early in the new year. The cosmic vibrations are working very much in your favor at the moment, so wish away. What have you got to lose?,pisces,The more you focus on a problem the more of a problem it seems to become – so why not ignore it for a while and see what happens? Chances are you will forget all about it before the week is more than a few hours old.
pisces,You will get the red carpet treatment wherever you go today – everyone thinks you are special. But you cannot possibly accept every invitation that comes your way, so be selective and don’t worry if you have to let some people down. ,pisces,If you find it hard to discuss things in a civilized manner with certain people then the best thing to do is to stay out of their way. You may have the best arguments but they don’t want to be told, so don’t waste your time on them. ,pisces,You will find your second wind in the final few days of the year but right now you are advised to take life at a sensible pace, especially if you are hosting friends and family over the holiday period. Don’t try to do everything yourself. ,pisces,You are brimming with confidence at the moment and your rampant self-belief will make things happen as if by magic. No task is too much, no challenge is too tough. You will find yourself surrounded by admirers and wannabe new friends. ,pisces,Neptune in your birth sign means you are at your best when you let the caring, sharing side of your nature come to the fore. Don’t worry that some people might take advantage of you – that’s a problem for their conscience, not yours. ,pisces,Whatever upheavals you were forced to go through in recent weeks the worst is now definitely over and what happens over the next 48 hours will give you cause to believe that 2015 will start on a high note. It’s okay to smile. ,pisces,If your sixth sense tells you that something is not quite right over the next few days you must listen to it and take extra care. Facts and figures may tell you one thing but they should never be allowed to overrule your intuition.
pisces,You are worrying about something that on most other occasions would not bother you in the slightest. It could be you are imagining things but more likely it is your inner voice trying to tell you something important. So listen.
pisces,It’s not your way to be overtly ambitious but an event has inspired you and you are determined to make something good of it in the new year. Set your sights high and promise yourself that whatever obstacles you face you will triumph in the end. ,pisces,Don’t let friends or relatives pressure you into doing something you don’t care for today. See in the new year the way you want to see it in, even if it means turning down a party invitation that everyone else is buzzing about. ,pisces,According to the planets you need to be less forgiving today, especially when dealing with people who clearly could not care less about your feelings. Start the new year the way you mean to go on: put your own interests first on every occasion. ,pisces,A new year is a great time for starting something fresh, especially if it involves other people and in some way or other expands your understanding of the world. A new hobby will bring a great deal of pleasure over the next few weeks. ,pisces,You may find it hard to trust other people but if you let go and let friends and work colleagues guide you then the next few days will bring some nice surprises. Not even a Pisces can know it all or do it all, so lighten up. ,pisces,Someone you have worked well with on creative projects in the past may not be so easy to work with over the next few days, but don’t let it worry you. Maybe you both need to do your own thing for a while. ,pisces,Certain things in your world are changing and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Nor is there any reason why you should want to. Be positive and believe that what happens is for the best, for you and for everyone.
pisces,Mixed signals are likely today and you could find yourself laughing when others expected you to be sad. It may be embarrassing but no great harm will come of it so long as you say sorry the moment you realize you got it wrong.
pisces,The most important thing now is that you have faith in your own abilities, even if some people have made it clear they think you are taking on too much. Success depends on may things but most of all it depends on confidence. ,pisces,Even if you are the kind of Pisces who tends to keep your opinions to yourself you won’t hesitate to speak your mind today – and quite right too. The one thing you can’t stand is injustice and you won’t turn a blind eye to it.
pisces,Everyone wants to please you, everyone wants to be your friend, which is nice. But don’t let it blind you to the fact that you may have to make some unpopular calls over the next few days. “Nice” doesn’t pay the bills. ,pisces,If you find your way blocked over the next 48 hours just use your imagination and find a way to go round the obstacle. There is no set path for the journey you are on, so be bold and try something different. It will be fun.
pisces,With Mars moving into your sign on Monday you will have no trouble thinking fast and acting fast. And that’s because you don’t have time to hang around – you have important things to accomplish and the clock never stops ticking.
pisces,Something you start over the next few days is destined to be of major importance to you over the coming year. Mars in your signs means you will outshine rivals and make a name for yourself. Make sure you are famous – not infamous. ,pisces,The message of the stars today is that you should finish what you have already begun rather than start something new. That applies to all areas of your life but especially to your working environment. Call a halt to new commitments.
pisces,You will receive good news today but for some strange reason you may find it hard to believe. The planets indicate that no one is trying to deceive you, so take what you hear on trust and, more importantly, act on it. ,pisces,With Mars in your sign you refuse to accept second best, which is good, but as Mars squares up to limitations planet Saturn today you do have to recognize that people in positions of power need to be respected – and sometimes obeyed. ,pisces,If someone tries to do you a favor don’t automatically assume that it’s some kind of scam. Despite what the headlines might suggest there are still a lot of genuine people out there in the world and you will meet one of them today. ,pisces,You are determined to be useful. You are determined to make a difference. Which is great, of course, but be selective about what you do and who you help this weekend. Not every cause, or person, is worthy or your assistance. ,pisces,You will be in a thoughtful mood during the early part of the week and that’s good because the more you think things through now the more likely it is they will go right for you later. Good thoughts are never wasted.
pisces,You may not be your usual sociable self today but in a way that’s good because you need to spend some time in your own company. Think about the direction your life is going – and consider what changes may be necessary later in the year. ,pisces,You will be in a thoughtful mood today and that’s good because the more you think about certain issues now the more likely it is they will work out for you later. Good thoughts, like good deeds, are seldom wasted. ,pisces,Do you listen to someone who claims to know what is going on or do you listen to that small voice inside your head that says they are talking rubbish? You know the answer to that one already. Trust your instincts today. ,pisces,Make it your aim over the next two or three days to finish something you started a long time ago. You may have to shut yourself away and be unsociable for a while but you really do need to focus and get it done.
pisces,If you have a secret – and you do – you must keep it to yourself. It may be about someone you don’t really care about but if it becomes public knowledge you will be the one who gets blamed for the consequences.
pisces,This won’t be a wild weekend for you – in fact it will be rather sedate. That’s okay, in fact it’s good. A lot has happened in recent weeks and you need time to mentally and emotionally digest the meaning of it all. Take your time. ,pisces,The entry of Venus into your sign on Tuesday means that life is going to get a lot better over the next few weeks. Always do your best and always think the best of other people, even though they sometimes do stupid things. ,pisces,You will have to deal with someone’s negative emotions today, without getting negative or emotional yourself. Whatever happens, either at home or at work, keep smiling and keep believing that your life is charmed – because it is. ,pisces,Venus, planet of harmony, moves into your sign today and almost immediately you will feel a sense of relief. Has anything actually changed? In the physical sense, probably not, but mentally and emotionally you are far more balanced.
pisces,The course of action you are about to take won’t meet with everyone’s approval but you don’t care about that. Too many times in the past you let other people’s opinions affect your ambitions – but this time you’re doing it your way. ,pisces,Put the past behind you and start again with a more positive attitude. Get over any guilt feelings you have about the things you should have done – and the things you should not have done. Life is for love and laughs, not tears. ,pisces,Your luck is well and truly in at the moment and if you don’t believe that now you will believe it over the weekend. Ask yourself what you would attempt to do if you knew that success was guaranteed – then do it and enjoy the rewards. ,pisces,You are good at some things but not so good at others, so focus on the former and let the latter take care of themselves. No one expects you to be an expert at everything so why expect it of yourself? Delegate what you’re not good at. ,pisces,You will know instinctively this week if what you are being told is the truth or a lie. Your sixth sense is so sharp that you pick up the tiniest changes in tone and body language. No lie detector machine is as sensitive as you!,pisces,If someone annoys you today just turn your back and walk away. If you allow yourself to get drawn into an argument you will get angry and say things you might later wish you had kept to yourself. They’re not worth the hassle. ,pisces,You may be convinced that your way of looking at something is correct but someone else is equally convinced that they are right and you are wrong. If you can agree to disagree, fine. If not, stay out of their way. ,pisces,The only thing you are interested in now is the truth and you will do whatever it takes to get it. Maybe that is why certain people look so worried. Maybe they don’t want you to know what they have been up to!,pisces,You owe someone a favor and you will be expected to repay it over the next 24 hours. There may be other things you would prefer to be doing but they went out of their way for you so do the same for them. ,pisces,You may feel a bit run down today but don’t let it worry you because things are not as bad as they seem. What little things can you do to make yourself feel comfortable? Then do them. It’s the little things that matter. ,pisces,Anything to do with love or art or beauty will go well for you this weekend. Venus in your sign, allied to passion planet Pluto, will inspire you to give of your best in any and every way possible. Be amazing.
pisces,Don’t bother asking other people for their ideas this week because all you will get is a dozen or more conflicting opinions. Be brave and follow what your instincts tell you, even if it turns everyone else against you. ,pisces,You need to explain to friends and relatives why you have done certain things. What your motives were is actually of secondary importance, what matters most is that they can see it is part of some kind of plan and not just random.  ,pisces,Someone will be vocal in their criticism of you today but there is no need to get alarmed, still less to get angry, because they mean well. Listen to what they have to say and accept that at least some their criticisms are valid. ,pisces,You will learn something you find hard to believe today but there it is in front of you and cannot be denied. It has in fact been in plain sight for quite a while, which begs the question: how did you manage to miss it. ,pisces,No matter how many things you may have on the go at work you must take care of the needs of loved ones first. You may be intensely ambitious but if your home life isn’t happy it’s unlikely you will be at your best.
pisces,If you need to be alone with your thoughts by all means go off on your own for a while. You don’t have to make excuses to those who were hoping for the pleasure of your company. It’s good to keep them wanting more.
pisces,There is a danger now that you could be a little too confident about money matters and start spending the stuff as if your bank account is a bottomless well. It isn’t. At the very least keep something in reserve to cover unexpected bills.
pisces,The Sun moves into your birth sign on Wednesday and from that day on your confidence and your lust for life will come flooding back. Don’t think you have to do everything at once though – pace yourself sensibly throughout the week. ,pisces,Your outlook on life will change beyond recognition over the next few days. In recent weeks you have questioned your aims and ambitions and come to the conclusion that you should be aiming much higher. Strive to reach your full potential.
pisces,Your energy levels are high but you can’t seem to decide what you should be doing with it all. That’s okay, in fact it’s good. The Sun’s move into your sign tomorrow will bring new challenges and new opportunities. Today, rest while you can. ,pisces,This is a hugely important day for you. Not only is there a new moon but the Sun’s move into your sign means a new start is possible. How and where in your life would you like to wipe the slate clean? So do it!,pisces,If you are asked to give more than you think is fair today you must speak up about it. Let others know you are not an easy touch and you will not be taken for a ride. If it means you fall out with someone, so be it. ,pisces,You may lose your cool about something that on most occasions would not bother you in the slightest. If you do flare up for no good reason calm down as quickly as you can and have the good grace to admit you went over the top.
pisces,Start something new this weekend, something that is likely to bring you fame and fortune later in the year. Positive activity in your birth sign means the universe is very much on your side at the moment. Milk it for all it is worth! ,pisces,The Sun in your birth sign suggests that if you want to change your life for the better you won’t be short of options over the coming week. The most important thing is that you forget about the past and think only of the future. Be positive. ,pisces,Don’t worry if your latest project does not seem to be making much progress – there is a good cosmic reason why you are being held back. Most likely you need to let the idea mature in your mind for a little while longer. ,pisces,If someone asks you to help with a cause that is close to your heart you will, of course, do so eagerly. But before you part with your time or your cash find out if they know what they are doing. Deal with professionals, not amateurs.
pisces,Something that has been worrying you for ages will worry you no longer come the end of the week. Cosmic activity in and around your birth sign means your outlook on life is changing for the better. Your worries are not worth worrying about.
pisces,You will get advice from all directions today and if you are smart you will ignore it all. You already know what it is you should be doing and all you need now is the courage to get on with it. Start now, this very minute.
pisces,Someone you live or work with will try to take liberties over the next 24 hours and although you are probably not that bothered you must not let them get away with it. If they can do it once they will try it on again and again.
pisces,You can accomplish something remarkable this weekend but you need to be focused and you need to devote every moment to the task at hand. Ask yourself: do you have the desire and the staying power to see it through to the end?,pisces,The full moon in your opposite sign of Virgo on Thursday will bring a partnership matter to a head. The good news is it won’t be as bitter as you thought it might. You have both made mistakes, so admit them and move on. ,pisces,You need to reveal more of your feelings. One of the reason others don’t know how to take you is because you have been wearing your deadpan face for so long they fear it might now be for real. It’s not, so get rid of it. ,pisces,You know what you want and you know how to get it and anyone who stands in your way won’t be standing for long. You may be gentle by nature but every now and again you go right the other way and just take what you desire.
pisces,If you don’t like the way those around you are doing things then you must speak up about it, especially if you fear their mistakes could cost you money. And if they won’t listen? Then maybe it is time to say goodbye.
pisces,Yes, of course, you have big plans, but have you thought them through properly? Today’s full moon in your opposite sign suggests you may have missed something of importance. A second opinion from someone you trust would be a good idea.
pisces,If you want to make changes then now is the time. No matter how laid back a Pisces you happen to be today’s Sun-Pluto link will spur you into action and you will get so many things done. If only you could be this dynamic every day!,pisces,You will be remarkably easygoing this weekend: no matter how badly other people may behave you won’t hold it against them. Either you are a saint or you are too caught up in your own dream world to care – most likely the latter!,pisces,You need to find ways to improve your finances and with Mars so active in the money area of your chart over the next few days you won’t lack for ideas. Just be careful you choose the right ones. This is not a good time to gamble.
pisces,What you own and what you earn is on your mind constantly at the moment but don’t worry yourself sick about it. There are more important things in life than dollars and cents, so keep a sense of perspective and find reasons to smile. ,pisces,Do you have what it takes to succeed? Of course you do. You may be a Pisces, one of the nicest signs in the zodiac, but that does not mean you cannot be ambitious too. If a promotion offer comes your way today you must take it.
pisces,You don’t lack for courage at the moment but the planets warn you could easily stray over the line into recklessness. They also warn that friends and finances won’t go well together over the next 24 hours, so keep them well apart.
pisces,Try not to get too hung-up on your long-term career plans. Yes, of course, you can and you must keep moving in your favored direction but there is no need to be so rigid about it. There is more than one route open to you now.
pisces,Mind planet Mercury movies into your sign today, making it so much easier to decide what it is you want and what you are willing to do to get it. Never doubt that your desires are valid – and never stop looking for ways to meet them.
pisces,Try not to take anything too seriously this weekend because the planets warn if you focus your mind too rigidly in one direction you could miss out on something more enjoyable that is happening in a different direction. Think lucky and you will be lucky.
pisces,You will be a lot more assertive than usual over the next few days, most likely because you can sense that time is running out and you need to make your play quickly. That may be true but don’t forget that quality counts for more than quantity. ,pisces,Don’t cut corners and hope no one notices, because they will. You may be slipping behind and need to catch up but there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The approaching eclipse will give you that extra surge of energy you need. ,pisces,Put financial considerations first today, especially if you are the kind of Pisces who usually does not have a clue how much is coming in and how much is going out. Cut back on unnecessary spending now or suffer later on.
pisces,Avoid taking any kind of gamble today, especially with money, because Mercury linked to Neptune in your sign means there is no telling how it will work out – you could be a big winner or you could be an equally big loser. Why risk it?,pisces,Tomorrow’s eclipse in your sign means that now is the time to go for glory. No matter how many times you have tried and failed before you WILL succeed now, so be positive and believe, really believe, that you are about to make the big time. ,pisces,It’s time to get serious about your dreams and ambitions. Look at the plans you have made in recent weeks and ask yourself if you are aiming too high or aiming too low. Most likely it’s the latter. Raise your sights and your game will follow. ,pisces,You need to question your priorities, especially those to do with your career and your money situation. You will get the chance to change things over the next few weeks but there is no point changing anything until you know what you really want. ,pisces,With Mercury in your sign linked to power planet Pluto you will think fast and act decisively over the next 24 hours. It would be great if you could be this dynamic every day but you can’t so make the most of it now. ,pisces,The universe wants you to throw caution to the wind and do something that takes everyone by surprise. Sometimes you can seem so laidback that others doubt you will ever be dynamic enough to succeed – but you’re about to prove them wrong. ,pisces,This is a good day to get out and about, to see and be seen. If you make new friends over the next 24 hours – and you surely will – they may well become friends for life, because you have so much in common.
pisces,You will reach an important decision concerning your career over the next 24 hours and although not everyone will agree with the route you choose you know it is the right one for you. Take what it is you want from life. ,pisces,You will find it much easier now to express yourself and others will find it easier to understand what you are trying to say. Your difficulties stem entirely from poor communications, but as from today the words will start to flow again.
pisces,You will find it difficult to make up your mind about something today but that may actually be a good thing. According to the planets it will pay you to put off making a decision about a work or money matter until early next week.
pisces,Jupiter, planet of good fortune, is undergoing one of its retrograde phases, which means you cannot take your luck for granted. Enjoy what happens over the next 48 hours but make plans for when times are not so good as well.
pisces,Try not to be so secretive about your feelings. According to the planets a certain person is as attracted to you as you are to them but, like you, they are not sure how to break the ice. Find out what lights their fire – and give it a try. ,pisces,It does not matter that you have made some kind of mistake, what matters is that you learn from it. Don’t be too stubborn to admit that you got it wrong, it’s no big deal. You are human like everyone else and mistakes are an integral part of life on this planet. ,pisces,Mars in the communications area of your chart makes it easy to say the kind of things that get you noticed, but don’t say too much or you might attract the kind of attention you don’t enjoy. Do you really want everyone to know your secrets? ,pisces,Time is moving on and the world is moving with it – so why are you standing still? Your attachment to the past is understandable but the best way to enjoy happiness and success is to earn them anew each and every day.
pisces,If you are finding it hard to make up your mind about something then don’t force it. Others may be pushing you to make a quick decision but only because it benefits them in some way. Your inner voice is telling you to wait.
pisces,Make sure your ego needs come first over the next 24 hours. You may be the type who worries more about other people than you do about yourself but you have needs and desires like everyone else. Make sure they are satisfied.
pisces,If you make life difficult for someone this weekend they will go out of their way to make life difficult for you later on and, on balance, you will fare worse. You won’t get anywhere by being aggressive. Try working as a team.
pisces,A commitment you made recently now doesn’t seem such a good idea and you may be wondering how to get out of it. Don’t worry, Monday’s Sun-Uranus link will throw everything up in the air again and provide you with a get-out clause. ,pisces,You don’t have to ask permission to make the changes you need but you do have to accept that not everyone will be happy with them. Also, the planets warn that the changes you make will be irreversible, so think before you act.
pisces,Little things will rub you up the wrong way in a big way over the next 24 hours. Others may say you are overreacting, and maybe you are, but you are also right to get annoyed. It is the little things that mean the most.
pisces,Some people say you should speak softly and carry a big stick but why do you need a stick when you know you can charm anyone you please? Your way with words is all the protection you need. There is magic in your voice.
pisces,Start something new today, something that will make you popular and make you some serious money. But don’t get impatient. This is a long-term project and it will take time to grow. Think long-term. Think of it as an investment.
pisces,Your viewpoint on an important issue will change dramatically over the next 48 hours – you may even end up at the opposite end of the opinion spectrum to where you are now. But that’s okay, you are allowed to change your mind. ,pisces,Aim to spend as much time as possible with loved ones over the next 48 hours. Remember too that no one is more important than those with whom you share a family bond. Your fates are entwined, so do what it takes to make it work.
pisces,Partners and relatives will be extremely demanding over the next few days – and you won’t mind one bit. You like to feel needed and the kind of problems they come to you with will be the sort you know how to handle.
pisces,What those around you say is going on may not be what is really going on, so use your Pisces powers of perception to find out what the true story is. Are they trying to keep things from you? Yes, most likely they are. ,pisces,If you need to say sorry for something you did earlier in the month then say it now. Venus in the domestic area of your chart means others will happily forgive and forget, but only if you are prepared to make the first move.
pisces,Let someone you respect and admire know how much they mean to you. You have benefited a lot from their advice and assistance in recent weeks and it is only right that you acknowledge that fact. Buy them lunch, or even dinner.
pisces,Try to avoid extremes this weekend because if you get carried away you could end up out of pocket financially and maybe out of favor with employers and other important people. Have fun by all means but watch what you say and do. ,pisces,The most important thing now is that you make a decision and stick to it, even if you have doubts about it later on. It does not actually matter if it is right or wrong, it matters only that you are consistent in your actions. ,pisces,The time has come to forgive and forget. The Sun moves on today and so must you – there is simply no point hanging on to disputes that belong in the past. It’s not about yesterday any more – all that matters is today and tomorrow.
pisces,You will be confronted with a very tough challenge today and you will deal with it with ease. That might surprise those people who have only ever seen the softer side of your nature but there is a core of steel running through the Pisces personality.
pisces,Make sure your opinions are heard over the next 24 hours, because if you don’t speak up you could find that matters you have an interest in move in a direction you don’t want them to go. Don’t be shy – shout if you have to.
pisces,You don’t need to pound rivals into submission, not when your way with words is such that you can sweet talk them into doing whatever it is you desire. Whether your words are sincere is another matter entirely, of course.
pisces,You have been far too nice of late, so now you need to even things up and make sure you get what you desire, regardless of whether others think you should have it. You are in control now, so make sure you are the one who wins.
pisces,You need to be absolutely sure that you won’t be out of pocket if you go along with what friends are planning this weekend. You will happily give up your time but if cash is involved you can and you must give it a miss. ,pisces,Someone who is older and wiser will give you some good advice this week and if you are smart you will listen and learn. There are certain mistakes you don’t have to make – and won’t make if you choose to not let your ego get in the way. ,pisces,Try not to let your imagination get the better of you today, because once it heads off in a crazy direction it may be hard to bring it back to reality. The next few days are about keeping your feet on the ground, not your head in the air.
pisces,Deals and negotiations of all kinds will go well today – you know just when to act tough and just when to make concessions. If you listen to that small voice inside your head there is no way you won’t come out a winner.
pisces,Travel and social activities are under excellent stars right now, so don’t sit at home thinking about what amazing things might be going on some place else – get up and get out and find out for yourself. Move fast, mentally and physically.
pisces,If you have something important to say you are advised to keep it short and sweet. The people you have to deal with, especially at work, are easily bored and will lose interest quickly if you spin things out too long. Get to the point.
pisces,A needy individual may get on your nerves but being the nice guy you are you will do what you can to help them. But make sure they know that this is not going to become a regular thing. Sooner or later they have to get a grip.
pisces,Where both family and career issues are concerned it might be wise to bend a little this weekend. Others may be rather demanding but if you help them out now they will assist later on when the roles are reversed. Invest in goodwill. ,pisces,Decide what needs to be done, then get on and do it. Some people may say you are moving too fast and taking too many risks, and maybe you are, but what fun would life be without stepping into the unknown occasionally? ,pisces,You have far too much going on in your life and today’s full moon will in some way or other shake things up and make you realize you need to cut back on your commitments. It should always be about quality, not quantity. ,pisces,Your mind may be full of big ideas right now but you must keep your feet on the ground. Most importantly, don’t commit yourself to any new plans or projects unless you know you will have the time to do them justice.
pisces,You may think that if you don’t act fast someone else will beat you to a prize that should have been yours – and maybe you’re right, maybe they will – but is it really so important? You don’t have to be this competitive.
pisces,Someone new on your social scene will get your heart beating faster today. Could a new romance be forming? Maybe, maybe not, but there is certainly a psychic link between you, a karmic connection that neither can ignore.
pisces,Why are you worrying so much? Whatever the reason – assuming there is a reason – you need to get over it because there is so much you could be doing with your life now. And remember, even negative events can have positive results.
pisces,It does not matter how much you give some people they still want more. Maybe you should take the hint and finally accept that this one-way street of you giving and them taking cannot go on. Cut the knot that binds you this weekend. ,pisces,Try not to get too possessive over something that is not really yours to own. You should know by now that the more you try to hold on to possessions the more likely they are to slip from your grasp, so hold it gently. ,pisces,Others may not agree with what you intend to do today but that won’t worry you in the slightest. Too often lately you have allowed others to control your behavior because you did not want to rock the boat. Now give it a really good shake! ,pisces,Too often in the past you have tried to mold yourself to fit other people’s expectations of you and sometimes the results have been less than pleasing. Be yourself today, and every day – it’s the only sure way to be happy.
pisces,You will make more progress between now and the Sun’s change of signs on the 21st if you keep to the middle path and avoid extremes. The more others say you must take sides the more you should strive not to commit yourself.
pisces,You seem to have a lot to say for yourself at the moment, which is fine, but if you talk too loud and too fast you may miss something worth hearing, something that could both have made you money and saved you trouble.
pisces,You will get through so much work today that some people may wonder aloud if you are on some kind of stimulant! You’re not, of course, but you are certainly in one of those moods when you feel almost superhuman. Up, up and away!,pisces,You may want to get a task out of the way quickly this weekend but the planets warn it is going to take longer than you expected. Don’t cut corners or leave it half-finished, get on with it and don’t stop until it is done, and done well.
pisces,If you have something to say then say it now as the approaching new moon endows you with persuasive powers and even your most doubtful critic will be compelled to believe you. It will be even better if what you say is true! ,pisces,There is no point trying to focus on everyday chores because there are so many great things going on around you that your attention is sure to wander. Save the routine stuff for another day – now is the time to have some fun. ,pisces,You may have nothing to hide but that does not give friends and family members the right to probe into your private affairs. Anyone who tries to do so today must be told in no uncertain terms to mind their own business.
pisces,Whatever new chores and duties come your way over the next few days – and there will be plenty – you can still have fun. Loved ones will go out of their way to make life enjoyable for you. Go out of your way to thank them.
pisces,The Sun’s move into the domestic area of your chart today means you need to devote more time to your family. Whatever your duties in other directions your main responsibility now is to those who depend on you the most.
pisces,You may be able to do a particular task better than just about anyone but that does not mean you should do it. You have more than enough on the go as it is at the moment, so don’t add to your load. Colleagues must share the burden.
pisces,It may seem as if someone is as dissimilar to you as chalk is to cheese but over the next two days you will learn you have a lot in common. Superficially you are hugely different but on a deeper level you think and feel as one.
pisces,If your conscience tells you that a certain course of action is wrong then you should give it a miss. If you push ahead regardless there will come a time towards the end of the week when you bitterly regret it. Listen to your inner voice.
pisces,You seem to be in a friendly and forgiving mood at the moment, which is good, but there is a danger you could get friendly with someone you need to be wary of. Mercury retrograde warns you must look out for your own interests first.
pisces,Don’t push yourself too hard over the next 24 hours. If you can get away with it today you should knock off early from work and give both your brain and your body a rest. Your batteries are desperately in need of a recharge. ,pisces,Whatever you are told by friends and family members today you should act on the assumption that there are things going on behind the scenes that would change the picture completely if you knew about them. Maybe you don’t want to know!,pisces,Don’t try to hide your feelings today because others will see right through you. Being such a sensitive soul you are rarely able to disguise your true emotions, so you might as well be open about them instead. Let everyone know how you feel.
pisces,An anxiety you should have conquered long ago will make its presence felt today and this time you must deal with it. The good news is that if you face it head-on rather than trying to avoid it you will realize just how little there is to fear.
pisces,Can you believe what your inner voice tells you? Not entirely. Can you believe what other people tell you? Absolutely not. This is one of those occasions when everyone’s ability to think straight is compromised, so try believing nothing at all.
pisces,Because Tuesday’s full moon highlights the career area of your chart you are advised not to antagonize people you work with, especially those who are above you in the pecking order. You can be a bit too outspoken at times. ,pisces,You will find yourself up against someone who is just too tough for you today. Do you back off and live to fight another day or do you go down fighting? It’s clear what the logical answer is but logic may have little to do with it. ,pisces,Today’s full moon warns this is not a good time to take risks or take liberties, especially on the work front. Something completely unexpected is likely to occur, so stay loose and be ready to adapt to whatever new power structure may arise.
pisces,You will get frustrated with people who can’t make up their minds today but there is no point trying to hurry them. For your own peace of mind it might be best to leave them out of your plans altogether and just do your own thing.
pisces,It’s not like you to be this assertive but something has stung you into action and you have every intention of making your mark. Your problem most of the time is that you are too sensitive but that won’t be such an issue today. ,pisces,A new project is more likely to be a success if you take your time and plan what needs to be done well in advance. The planets will give a much-needed boost to your energy but you still need to take things a step at a time.
pisces,One side of your personality is mellow and laidback but the other half is fiercely ambitious. How do you reconcile the two? Be Mr. Tough Guy at work and be Mr. Nice Guy when at home and out socializing. Compartmentalize your world. ,pisces,Certain things will happen over the next few days that you could not have predicted and which you have no way of stopping. They may be unsettling but they also contain within them the seeds of future success, so stay alert and be ready to act.
pisces,There may be times over the next 24 hours when you wish you were some place else, but the fact is you are where you are and you have to complete what others expect of you. Both at home and at work you have obligations. ,pisces,If you have been a bit too free and easy with the cash in recent weeks then you will have to make savings between now and the end of the month. You may be tempted to have one final splurge today but, seriously, what’s the point?,pisces,A few words from you could be all it takes to cheer up someone who is depressed. Remind them they still have so much to smile about . Remind them that life is supposed to be fun. You are, after all, living proof of that.
pisces,Cosmic activity in the domestic area of your chart will help you to resolve differences of opinion that have dragged on too long. It’s always a good idea to get along with those you live with – even more so those you love.
pisces,You can have anything you want now, provided you give others what they want in return. Put your competitive instincts to one side over the next 24 hours and co-operate for the greater good – because it’s good for you as well. ,pisces,What can you do to make life more enjoyable? For starters you can stop worrying about loved ones who, to your eyes at least, seem to be going off the rails a bit. Most likely it is nothing more than youthful high spirits. Indulge them.
pisces,There will be times over the week ahead when certain people seem to be deliberately ignoring you – but even if it is true, what of it? You don’t need their attention, still less their praise. In fact they will be the ones who end up missing you.
pisces,Because you can sense that major changes are coming you may be a bit touchy today. The best way to get over it is to have fun with your friends. If you sit at home and dwell on your fears your mind will play tricks on you.
pisces,Do what you want to do over the next 24 hours and don’t let those who seem to do nothing but criticize talk you down. Keep whatever self-doubts you have to yourself and act as if you cannot possibly lose – and you won’t.
pisces,A friend or relative will surprise everyone by what they do today and emotions are likely to be running high as a result. You though must remain calm and not let your own biases affect your judgment. It’s not a matter of life or death.
pisces,Act decisively today. Push through changes. Make sure that what has been started finally gets finished. Problems of a purely personal nature have taken up too much of your time and energy in recent weeks, so resolve them and move on.
pisces,A few days from now you will be in a position to do what you please, but before then there is something you must do to please a loved one. On the home front especially you should give without thought of what you might get in return.
pisces,After the trials and tribulations of recent weeks a more light-hearted phase begins this weekend and you have every right to go out and celebrate. But don’t bounce from one extreme to the other and start acting outrageously every chance you get!,pisces,Others say you lack ambition but when Mars joins the Sun in the most dynamic area of your chart in midweek you will prove your critics wrong. Your passion for a plan or project of some kind will enthuse your colleagues, and guarantee its success.
pisces,You will be torn between your head and your heart over the next 24 hours. As a Water sign you are more likely to follow your emotions and that’s good because your mind is liable to play tricks on you. It’s what you feel that matters. ,pisces,By all means be willing to compromise but be careful you don’t give in too easily and give others the impression that you can be manipulated. Negotiations will go better if you make the effort to bargain a bit, but it must be from a position of strength.
pisces,Life is not a zero sum game and other people don’t have to lose just so you can win. Keep that fact in mind today and strive to find ways to profit that will benefit friends and work colleagues as well. Be ambitious but be creative too. ,pisces,You would be wise not to take too much for granted today. If you push your luck too far you could find you have gone over the edge and there is no way back. With Mars in your favor you can be dynamic but don’t be reckless.  ,pisces,You must stay true to your feelings and beliefs. The more others try to persuade you to change your way of looking at and dealing with the world the more you must dig in your heels and refuse to be moved. No one can force you. ,pisces,More than most signs you can be swayed by emotional factors, but that could be dangerous this weekend, especially when it comes to money issues and business matters. You cannot afford to be sentimental about what you own and what you earn.
pisces,Your mind is full of ideas but are they good ideas? You won’t know for certain until Thursday’s full moon has come and gone, so be patient. Listen to what friends and loved ones tell you – they can see holes in your plans that you may have missed. ,pisces,The excessive side of your personality is likely to come to the fore this week, especially from Wednesday to Friday when the moon is full. If you do go over the top in some way you must make amends as quickly as you can.
pisces,Some problems can be resolved by hammering them into submission, but the problem you face now requires a more subtle approach. If you are not sure what the word means get a dictionary and look it up! Use brains, not brawn.
pisces,You need to put the finishing touches to something of a creative nature this weekend, because if you put it on the back burner again it will never get done. If those who are supposed to be helping you still drag their feet – get rid of them!,pisces,Certain individuals are a pain with their constant demands and you would gladly turn your back on them if you could but you’re just not that kind of person. Do what you can for them over the next few days – but don’t do everything.
pisces,What takes place today may not be to your liking but later in the month you will be glad you were forced to make certain changes. The simple fact is you have been pushing yourself too hard and must slow down for a while.
pisces,You may need to shut yourself away from all possible distractions for a few hours today, especially if you want to finish a task that has been dragging on too long. With Mars in your favor you can and you must get it done. ,pisces,Sticking to a rigid plan of action will limit your options and make success much harder to come by, so be flexible and don’t be afraid to change direction. Most importantly, of all, don’t set targets. Take each day as it comes.
pisces,Your imagination is extremely powerful but there are times when it gets the better of you and your fears get out of hand, so be careful. The first step toward resolving your current problem is to stop worrying about it so much.
pisces,Cosmic activity in your fellow Water sign of Cancer makes you both dynamic and relaxed about life and with a combination like that you are sure to succeed. Whatever others might say or do today don’t let them spoil your mood.
pisces,Pisces may not be the most daring member of the zodiac but once you make a choice you stick with it and see it through to the end. The difficult part is finding the courage to start, so start now while your confidence is sky high.
pisces,Some of the thoughts you have over the next few days will be so outrageous that they scare you a little. You may be conservative by nature but even a Pisces is able to think “outside the box” now and again. Think the unthinkable.
pisces,Throw yourself body and soul into what you are working on and believe that it will all come right in the end. The moment you start worrying about what could go wrong is the moment you begin to lose focus and momentum. Keep going. ,pisces,If you are in any way creative or artistic and have ambitions in these areas then what happens over the next few days will give you the chance to show what you can do. You’re not just as good as everyone else, you’re better.
pisces,If there is anything of a detailed nature that you have to do you should postpone it for another day. The planets warn you will be easily distracted over the next 24 hours, so don’t set yourself targets and goals you are unlikely to reach. ,pisces,Amazing things will happen for no apparent reason over the next 24 hours. The new moon is well and truly on your side, making this a great time to try something original and exciting. Creatively and romantically you can do no wrong.
pisces,The Sun remains in the most creative and dynamic area of your chart only until the 23rd, so there is still time to do something amazing but you have got to be quick. Get your act together and make the world sit up and take notice. ,pisces,As Venus, planet of affection, moves into your opposite sign this weekend you must put all your doubts and suspicions aside and give partners and loved ones the benefit of the doubt. Forget yesterday’s trials – it’s tomorrow’s triumphs that count.
pisces,Work and health matters will be even more important than usual this week and you need to sit yourself down and start thinking about what you are doing and where you are going. You owe yourself a rest and now is a good time to take it. ,pisces,No matter how dynamic you have been in recent weeks you must now start to slow down a bit. You have pushed the boundaries both physically and emotionally and the fact is you cannot keep pushing them forever. Be kind to yourself. ,pisces,Someone you are fond of will say or do something that pleases you today but someone else will say or do something that annoys you. Your mood will depend on how you choose to react. Some people are easily ignored. ,pisces,You may think that your latest big idea is practical but it seems not everyone agrees with you. Your first and most important task today is to find out why they are less than enthusiastic about your plans. It could save you considerable grief.
pisces,You can be a creature of habit and over the next few days at least one of your habits needs to be looked at and, if it is negative in nature, transformed into something more positive. At work, try to unchain yourself from the same old routines. ,pisces,You will be tempted to seek advice this weekend from people you think you can trust, but that may not be the most advisable thing to do, not with values planet Venus turning retrograde in your opposite sign. Make no sudden moves. ,pisces,You will be tempted to seek advice this weekend from people you think you can trust, but that may not be the most advisable thing to do, not with values planet Venus turning retrograde in your opposite sign. Make no sudden moves.
pisces,There is no point getting emotional about things that need to be dealt with on an intellectual level. If you allow your personal feelings to get the better of you this week you will confuse not only others but also yourself.
pisces,Decide what it is you want to do, then get on and do it. Yes, of course, some people will kick up a fuss about it but what can they actually do to stop you? Nothing. It’s your life and it’s up to you what you do with it.
pisces,You must spend some time planning what you are going to do. If nothing else it will enable you to get twice as much done as you would have had you rushed in and hoped for the best. Always try to think and plan ahead.
pisces,Deep down you realize that what you are going through is necessary but why does it have to be so tough? Fortunately, the approaching full moon will bring matters to a head and it won’t be long before you are on the up again. ,pisces,You must be totally and utterly honest with yourself about what it is you want and what you have to do to get it. And if you come to the conclusion that the price is too high then lower your sights and aim for something less demanding.
pisces,What you thought might take months to accomplish can now be done in a matter of days. Believe in yourself and don’t be afraid to take on rivals who are bigger or better connected. They are actually more scared of you than you are of them.
pisces,You could do worse this weekend than put yourself in a loved one’s hands and let them decide what to do. In fact, over the next week or so you are likely to gain more by doing less things for yourself. Let other people spoil you.
pisces,If the recent full moon taught you anything it must surely have been that there is only so much you can accomplish on your own. If you want something enough you will find ways to get it, but you might get it quicker if you ask for assistance.
pisces,Watch out you don’t get too ruthless for your own good this week. Yes, you are entitled to put your own needs first but don’t trample all over other people just because they are temporarily in your way. ,pisces,Get stuck into your work and get things done. Even if you prefer to leave the nuts and bolts to other people you will actually enjoy taking care of details today. Just make sure you don’t get so involved that you lose sight of the bigger picture.
pisces,You seem to have more options than you know what to do with. That might sound like fun to some people but for a Pisces it can be a problem as your mind has a tendency to dart all over the place. Select a goal and stick with it.
pisces,Don’t let your Pisces pride get in the way of securing your future. You cannot possibly do everything on your own, so put your ego aside and join forces with people who share your aims and ambitions. You are better together.
pisces,At some stage today or over the weekend you will have to decide whether to follow your dream or to scale back your aspirations and take the same well-trodden path that so many have taken before you. So, follow your dream it is then!,pisces,If you feel you are trapped in a situation where the same old things happen in the same old way over and over again then it’s time to do something about it. Remember, it’s your life and ultimately you are the one who calls the shots.
pisces,Don’t go along with a friend’s suggestion just to make them feel good. If it goes wrong – and the planets warn that it might – you could both end up feeling a lot worse than before. You know the old saying: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
pisces,This should be a really good week for you but there is a danger that you might be tempted to focus on minor failures and not allow yourself to enjoy the good things in life, of which there are plenty. Learn how to laugh at yourself.
pisces,Nothing in life happens without a reason and if you bear that thought in mind it should make it easier to deal with an event that on the surface seems senseless. Something sparked it off, something made it happen. Find out what that something is.
pisces,You are going to have to make some major decisions over the next few days, the kind of decisions that have far-reaching consequences. Don’t put them off in the hope that they might go away. Be brave and do what has to be done. ,pisces,There is no point blaming yourself for something that went wrong – it was bound to happen sooner or later. Your main task now is to start rebuilding what fate in its wisdom has seen fit to destroy. This time, make sure the foundations are strong.
pisces,You know what you want to do, so why are you still holding back? Most likely it’s because you fear you may upset people whose support you have always depended on in the past. The simple fact is you no longer need them.
pisces,It would appear that you are putting off starting something because you know the first few steps are going to be difficult. No matter how long you wait they won’t get any easier, so take the plunge now. Once you’ve started it will be fun. ,pisces,Any hostility you may have experienced of late can be easily overcome, by refusing to repay bad words and deeds in kind. Jupiter in the partnership area of your chart will make it easy for you to see the good that exists in all other people. ,pisces,Personal matters are causing you a lot of concern at the moment and things are likely to come to a head when the Sun links with Saturn at the end of the week. Between now and then be good to yourself and get plenty of rest.
pisces,Don’t waste time asking yourself why certain things happened the way they did because you cannot go back and change the past. The only thing that matters now is what happens next and that is entirely within your control. Be positive.
pisces,Other people may be breaking the rules left, right and center but that is not an excuse for you to follow their example. Keep doing what you are doing and keep doing it the right way. There is simply no need for you to cut corners.
pisces,You will be generous toward other people today and they in turn will be generous toward you. Look past superficial differences and realize that, no matter how much people may seem to vary, we are all much the same under the skin. ,pisces,Be careful you don’t go over the top and make enemies of people who should be your friends. You may believe that you are speaking the truth, and no doubt you are, but if you hurt others’ feelings they will hurt you right back.
pisces,If you have any obvious flaws or failings others will be quick to point them out to you. The Sun’s entry into your opposite sign this weekend means that in one-to-one relationships you will have to be a lot more open to criticism than you usually are.
pisces,Try not to be reckless with your cash or possessions over the next few days because you are going to need all your resources. If someone asks you for a loan either say “no” outright or tell them you will think about it, then make yourself scarce.
pisces,Your head may be full of great ideas but the planets warn you need to make sure they are practical. If not you could be heading for disaster around the time of Saturday’s full moon. Plan carefully and don’t let your enthusiasm carry you away. ,pisces,You know you can trust your own instincts but can you trust other people’s instincts? With Neptune, your ruler, undergoing one of its retrograde phases it might be wise not to take what others tell you at face value over the next 24 hours.
pisces,Try not to take anything too seriously today, especially where affairs of the heart are concerned. A new relationship may be making your heart beat faster but the planets warn it may just be a short-term fling, so don’t get too attached. ,pisces,For quite some time now you have had the feeling that you are on the wrong track, and what happens over the next few days may confirm your suspicions. It’s not the end of the world – on the contrary, it’s the start of a new adventure. ,pisces,You may prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt but the planets warn you should be wary of someone you think you can trust. Yes, maybe you are being suspicious for no good reason, but better safe than sorry.
pisces,A full moon in your sign adds to the confusion of retrograde Neptune, so don’t be surprised if your thoughts and feelings are all over the place this weekend. This is a time not for doing but for dreaming – and you do that so well.
pisces,According to the planets you are reading too much into what other people say and do. You should know by now that it is what you say and do that counts, so go your own way and do your own thing and let others worry about that. ,pisces,Be careful what you say during the early part of the week because your words could have a negative effect on an important relationship. Yes, the other person is too touchy for your liking but that’s just the way they are, so make allowances. ,pisces,You will want to unburden your feelings over the next 24 hours and that’s okay. Don’t worry that by baring your soul you might give others the impression that you are weak. On the contrary, it shows you possess inner strength.
pisces,You seem rather assertive at the moment but don’t go too far and try to force people to do things your way when they obviously don’t want to. You may succeed but you will also create unnecessary bad feeling. Think before you act.
pisces,If you strive to find a middle way you will do yourself a lot of favors, especially on the work front where colleagues and employers will respond in kind if you show you are willing to give ground. You won’t lose out if you meet them halfway.
pisces,Confrontation of one sort or another is likely today. It will be less of a problem if you resist the urge to pull rank on people you work with, because they will find ways to get back at you. They should be friends, not enemies.
pisces,A hugely positive aspect between the Sun and Pluto makes you think you are invincible, that no matter where you go and what you do you will come through unscathed. The remarkable thing is you may be right, so be bold.
pisces,You may be less sociable than usual over the next few days but in a way that’s good because some people will seek to take advantage of you. Be wary of anyone who suddenly wants to be your friend. Why were they not your friend before? ,pisces,Promise yourself now that no matter how bad things seem to get over the next few days you will not overreact. Chances are they are not really that bad at all but if you think they are you may be tempted to do something foolish. ,pisces,The planets are trying to tell you that you have been working too hard. Your priority today and for the rest of the week is to rearrange your schedule so as to give yourself more time to relax. If not you could be heading for disaster. ,pisces,You will have to defend your beliefs with every weapon at your disposal over the next 24 hours. Every time others challenge your opinions you must hit back twice as hard. Give them no quarter. Show them no mercy. It’s all or nothing. ,pisces,Try not to take it personally if someone you care for acts coldly towards you over the next few days. They have some serious issues to deal with, so give them time, give them space and they will be back to their old selves very soon.
pisces,You will get the chance to put relationships on a firmer footing over the next few days and you must make good use of it. It will, of course, be easier if you are willing to confess that your attitude has been part of the problem.
pisces,Open your heart and let partners and loved ones know how much you cherish them. The eclipse in your opposite sign of Virgo will make it easy to show your affectionate side this weekend. Forget about thoughts – it’s your feelings that matter. ,pisces,Let other people call the shots this week. Let friends and loved ones decide where you are going to go and what you are going to do. Go along for the ride and milk each moment for what it has to offer. Make pleasure your guiding principle.
pisces,You need to resolve a dispute with a loved one or work colleague and you need to do it right now. If you let the situation fester for even one more day it may move beyond the point where it is easily rescued. Say sorry, and move on.
pisces,There are so many serious things going on around you at the moment that others are unlikely to be in the mood for fun and games. That’s okay, you can entertain yourself well enough. You’re certainly not going to join in all the doom and gloom. ,pisces,Neptune, your ruler, is linked with mind planet Mercury today, so your brain will be buzzing with big ideas. But are they practical ideas? For best results you should limit yourself to one or two objectives you know you can easily reach.
pisces,The best way to deal with a negative situation is to ignore it. No, really. The more you focus on what’s going wrong the longer it will stick around, so starve it of the oxygen of attention and see how fast it shrinks in importance.
pisces,Be careful what you say today because certain people will take you seriously, maybe more seriously than you intended. On the work front especially don’t give rivals a stick with which they can beat you. Sometimes you’re your own worst enemy.
pisces,No doubt there are certain individuals you would like to be on better terms with but would that really change things? Probably not. The real problem is that you don’t stand up for yourself enough. It’s time to get tough. Bite back! ,pisces,Recent cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Virgo has just about finished its job of toughening you up emotionally and soon you will be able to focus on more enjoyable things. Today you may have to stand up for yourself one final time.
pisces,A task you took on earlier in the month is making no progress and you are on the verge of admitting defeat. However, the planets indicate if you stick it out the tide will turn in your favor in a matter of days. Don’t give up on it yet.
pisces,Help will arrive when you need it over the next few days, but it might arrive quicker if you were not so determined to suffer in silence. Also, where finances are concerned a long-term plan is a must – don’t leave anything to chance. ,pisces,You do not need to ask permission to enjoy yourself, nor do you need to ask if it’s okay to make money. Great riches can be yours over the next few weeks, if you follow your instincts and put fear of failure firmly behind you.
pisces,Plan something enjoyable for this evening and over the weekend, something that takes you out of yourself, something that takes your minds off your problems. Forget about your woes and have a really good time with your friends or your family.
pisces,It will be all too easy to dwell on the negative this weekend, especially if there are things you have left undone. However, the approaching lunar eclipse demands that you adopt a more positive attitude. Without it you won’t get far at all. ,pisces,You may be tempted to splash out on something you desire but cannot really afford and, of course, you will regret it if you do. Yes, okay, so it’s only money but there are more sensible things you can and should be spending it on.
pisces,Make sure you keep track of how much money you spend during the early part of the week because you could easily get carried away and empty your pockets without much to show for it at the end. Happiness is not something that needs to be bought.
pisces,Put your doubts and suspicions about a certain individual to one side and give them a chance to prove themselves. Almost certainly you have been too harsh in your judgment. Almost certainly what is good for them is good for you too.
pisces,The planets warn that a colleague you think you can trust is not being entirely honest with you. Take heed if a friend warns you against this person — it may look like jealousy but the fact is they don’t want to see you get hurt. ,pisces,Relationships will generally go well over the next 24 hours but be wary of anyone whose attitude towards you goes from one extreme to the other in a matter of minutes. It could be they are trying to confuse you for their own benefit.
pisces,You may not be able to explain how you reach a certain conclusion but your instincts tell you it is right, so trust them. Financial matters are especially well starred today and over the weekend – IF you listen to and act on your subconscious promptings.
pisces,Because the Sun is moving through the wealth area of your chart you may be tempted to risk a lot to gain a lot. Is that such a wise idea? Probably not. Stick with what you know and carry on doing what you are doing – only better than before.
pisces,You will have to overcome some sort of challenge this week, either in your personal life or at work. You are perfectly equipped to take on rivals and win, so don’t back down. Sometimes you can be too nice for your own good.
pisces,Pisces is a mutable sign, which means you are more flexible than most, and that attribute should serve you well over the next few days. While others are unwilling to adapt you will be making compromises and profiting from them. ,pisces,Don’t worry too much about the details of what you are doing, just commit yourself to it body and soul and have confidence that it will all come right in the end. The only thing you must never lose sight of is the bigger picture. ,pisces,You may have to endure a few setbacks between now and the weekend but don’t let them unsettle you. Above all, don’t lose your temper with people you have to work with on a day-to-day basis. They are in much the same boat as you. ,pisces,The only way you are going to get ahead is to co-operate – not just with friends and colleagues but with rivals too. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Virgo demands that you focus on what unites you, not on what keeps you apart. ,pisces,Your needs and desires have not often been satisfied in recent weeks but over the next few days, leading up to the new moon on the 13th, you will make up for lost time. The sacrifices you have made will be worth it in the long-term.
pisces,By all means speak from the heart this weekend but don’t think that everyone will want to hear what you say. One person in particular is liable to kick up a fuss and refuse to take heed. Still, it’s their loss, not yours. ,pisces,If you are the kind of Pisces who likes to be in control then what happens over the next few days may not be to your liking. Having said which, the results won’t be as bad as you feared – you may even gain from changes you opposed. ,pisces,The planets urge you to keep things simple and also to keep in mind that you never get something for nothing. If someone makes you an attractive offer now it can only be because they will want something from you later on. Be wary.
pisces,What happens over the next few days may be unsettling but if you keep your wits about you there is no reason why you should not profit from the situation. Use your Pisces sensitivity to work out where the big opportunities are, then go for them. ,pisces,Go where your instincts take you and ignore those who say you have got it wrong. Never be afraid to take a few risks and explore further afield. That applies especially to affairs of the heart. Travel for pleasure today and tomorrow. ,pisces,You see trouble developing well before anyone else, which gives you a major advantage over rivals and competitors. Your way with words is also a handy weapon and anyone who challenges you today will most likely wish they had kept quiet!,pisces,The odds are in your favor at the moment, so make the most of them and make things easy for yourself by swimming with the tide rather than fighting against it. If someone wants to do things for you today all you have to do is let them.
pisces,Don’t worry if you feel that you are being held back in some way because what happens early next week will clear away any and all obstructions. Spend the weekend relaxing and making sure your body and mind are fit and ready for action. ,pisces,You have been far too suspicious of late and it has held you back. A few days from now though the Sun moves in your favor and you won’t have a doubt in your mind. You DO have what it takes to succeed – so get to it. ,pisces,You will be swamped with offers over the next few days and you may have a hard time deciding which ones to accept and which ones to reject. Ask a trusted friend or family member what they would do in your place.
pisces,Anyone who takes you on today is likely to regret it. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign of Virgo makes you hugely combative, so much so that you may actually go looking for trouble. Try not to alienate people who could be useful to you.
pisces,You must keep your wits about you today, especially when dealing with cash and investments. It is unlikely that anyone is trying to cheat you intentionally but just because someone else has made a mistake does not mean you have to make it too. ,pisces,The Sun is about to move into one of the most adventurous areas of your chart and you must take full advantage of it. If you get the chance to travel over the next few weeks don’t hesitate, just pack your bag and go. ,pisces,The Sun in Scorpio over the next few weeks will reveal new ways of thinking and new ways of looking at the world, and once you realize what you have been missing you won’t want to go back to the old ways. The future starts here.
pisces,There is no way of knowing if a certain situation will turn out the way you want it to. All you can do is go with the flow and hope for the best. Fortunately, today’s Venus-Jupiter links suggests it will. For some reason everyone loves you. ,pisces,You will speak your mind and leave no one in any doubt as to what you believe. You may in fact be the only one who thinks that way but no matter. Sometimes it’s good to be controversial. You will certainly enjoy it.
pisces,The approaching full moon demands that you must be totally honest with yourself about what it is you desire and what it is you will have to do to get it. And if you decide that the price is too high then simply lower your sights a bit. ,pisces,You have no fear and follow your desires wherever they lead, but as there is a rather threatening-looking full moon today you should steer clear of anything that is too excessive – depending on what your definition of “excessive” is, of course. ,pisces,Anything that sounds too good to be true over the next 24 hours is most likely a trick to part you from your hard-earned cash. You are, of course, far too intelligent to fall for it, but watch out for friends and loved ones too. ,pisces,If you have a longing to travel, to visit faraway places, you will almost certainly be on the move over the next few weeks. The Sun in Scorpio will awaken your sense of adventure. It’s time to stop dreaming and start doing!,pisces,You will be amazingly confident today, thanks to the Sun’s link with your ruling planet Neptune. Creatively and artistically there is nothing you cannot accomplish if you believe in yourself. Romantically, too, this is a time for taking chances.
pisces,You will go out of your way to make sure others know how you think and feel this weekend, and that’s good. The more you let friends and relatives know what your views are the more they will respect what you have to say. ,pisces,Unless you are 100 per cent certain that you have been cheated or misled in some way it might be wiser to keep your thoughts to yourself until you know the full story. Mercury’s change of signs on Monday will clarify the situation.
pisces,You must stick to the facts over the next 24 hours because if you make things up you will be found out and it will be embarrassing. You may have the gift of the gab at the moment but if you are smart you will not abuse it.
pisces,You need to decide whether or not you are going to commit yourself to a partnership. It may be a personal matter or it may have something to do with your work but with Venus and Mars on your side you are sure to make the right call.
pisces,People in positions of power will be a bit touchy today, so think before you speak and think again before you act. Your reputation could suffer if you upset those who call the shots. You don’t have to be passive but you do have to be careful.
pisces,Someone will let you in on what they say is a secret today but can you be sure they are not trying to mislead you? The planets warn that what they tell you will only be part of the story, so make some enquiries of your own.
pisces,Money worries of one sort or another have caused you a lot of sleepless nights of late but it won’t be long before your financial problems are solved. Having said which, that is not an excuse to go on yet another spending binge.
pisces,Steer clear of other people’s battles. If you allow yourself to get involved you could find it impossible to break free again. Their problems are for them to deal with and learn from – it’s not as if you don’t have enough of your own! ,pisces,A new moon in the most adventurous area of your chart means you will need little persuasion to stray from the straight and narrow this week. Hopefully it will be in ways others can relate to – and hopefully your name will stay off the news bulletins! ,pisces,You may not be the life and soul of the party at the moment but give it time. The approaching new moon is already making you feel more adventurous and come Wednesday you will be your happy, upbeat self again.
pisces,The more time and energy you have put into something the more reluctant you will be to give up on it but deep down you know the break needs to be made. Clear a space in your life and something better will come in to fill it.
pisces,If your present situation does not stimulate you as much as you want it to then now is the perfect time to start making changes. You will get plenty of opportunities to change direction over the next few days – but think before you act. ,pisces,You cannot turn back the clock and change the past but you can learn from your experiences, be they good or be they bad. Also, promise yourself that both now and in the future you won’t let so many great opportunities go begging.
pisces,You will come to the aid of someone in need today and it will do you both a lot of good. Selfless actions always come back to the person who makes them and some day someone will help you when you most need assistance. ,pisces,You know you must make a decision and you know you must make it soon but you are worried how certain people might react. Don’t be. Whatever you choose to do those who matter to you the most will back you all the way.
pisces,Cosmic activity in and around the career area of your chart warns that you may fall out with someone in a position of authority over the next few days. By all means stick up for yourself but don’t make enemies of people for no good reason.
pisces,Someone will go out of their way to provoke you today and you will find it hard not to react. That, of course, is what they are hoping you will do because it will give them the excuse they need to punish you. Don’t fall into their trap. ,pisces,A friend or co-worker will make you the kind of offer you find hard to believe today but if you don’t take it seriously you will kick yourself later when you realize that it was on the level. Good things are coming your way – use them. ,pisces,If you are having second thoughts about something then stop immediately and see which way fate points you between now and the start of next week. The Sun’s imminent change of signs could lead to some big changes in your goals as well.
pisces,The grass may look greener on the other side of the fence but you are advised not to make changes just yet. Wait until the Sun changes signs on the 22nd before making your move – you may find that you don’t have to after all. ,pisces,Your confidence has been sky-high of late and you certainly won’t be afraid to take chances today and over the weekend. The fact that the possibility of failure never enters your head means that success is more likely than not – maybe even guaranteed.
pisces,Let everyone around you know where you are coming from and where you are planning to go. They won’t all agree with your choice of destination, of course, but they will have no alternative but to agree that you have every right to go there.
pisces,If you have not given much thought to your status and reputation of late then maybe you should give it some thought now. With the Sun moving through the career area of your chart you can, with a little bit of effort, move up in the world rapidly.
pisces,Don’t take on any new commitments today because you will regret it later in the week if you do. The Sun’s move into the career area of your chart means you won’t lack for opportunities but you need to be patient. Time is on your side.
pisces,You are going through a phase where everything you believe in is being put to the test. It may be a painful process but it needs to happen so that you can reach a better understanding of who you really are and what you really need. ,pisces,The Sun in the career area of your chart urges you to change things if you are unhappy with your lot in life. However, the current full moon warns you should wait a couple of days at least before making your move. There’s no need to rush. ,pisces,You can take great strides on the work front now that the Sun is moving through the area of your chart that governs your professional reputation. Very Important People will be on your side and very soon you could be a VIP yourself.
pisces,A chapter in your life has been finished and it is time to move on. There may be one or two tears but that is natural and nothing to be ashamed of. The good news is that what comes next will be much more enjoyable than what went before. ,pisces,You must not be afraid to say things that the powers that be won’t like. The world needs people like you who are not scared to rock the boat a little and what you say this weekend will lead to much-needed changes before the end of the year. ,pisces,Your mind may be full of big ideas but you need to work out which are worth pursuing and which are no more than idle daydreams. If you find it hard to decide get a trusted friend to help you. They have the perspective that you may lack.
pisces,Your thinking will be both deeper and wider over the next few days as you leave behind trivial matters and focus on what really counts in this life. Also, try to worry less about money – you will always find ways to pay the bills. ,pisces,By all means get on the right side of employers and other important people but don’t make promises you may not be able to keep. Just be yourself and have faith that those in authority will like what they see. They will, because you’re a Pisces. ,pisces,It may seem as if certain factors are working against you at the moment, and maybe they are, but there is no need to panic. The planets are making some situations seem tougher than they really are, so hang on in there – your luck will change soon. ,pisces,Try not to spread yourself too thin. The planets warn if you take on too much today both your body and your mind will regret it. Focus only on those things that have to be done – the rest can wait for another day, or another lifetime. ,pisces,You may not be able to control what happens today but you can control the way you react to it. The more others try to mess with your mind the more you must strive to stay serene and not let it get to you. You’ll win in the end.
pisces,You seem far more adventurous than usual and if you are thinking of taking a vacation you should pack a bag and head off into the unknown. Venus, planet of love, indicates that while on your travels you could meet someone who becomes very special indeed.
pisces,Take care that in your haste to dig yourself out of a hole you don’t end up digging it even deeper. Later on you will realize that your situation is not as bad as you think it is, so don’t make things worse than they need to be. ,pisces,Cosmic activity in one of the more adventurous areas of your chart urges you to strike out in a new direction. Don’t think about it or you will come up with a thousand reasons for not moving forward. Just act and deal with the consequences later.
pisces,If you are the kind of Pisces who relies too much on your emotions then you may stray some way from the truth today. The more you see conspiracies round every corner the more you can be sure that your imagination is playing tricks on you. ,pisces,You may be eager to prove yourself but you must be selective. If you scatter your energy in several directions it is highly unlikely that you will get far in any of them, so focus on what means most to you and aim to be the best at it. ,pisces,Difficult choices concerning your work or career will have to be made very soon but don’t do anything before you have consulted people whose opinions you trust. It could be they can suggest less painful ways of making the changes you need. ,pisces,You may be ambitious but the planets warn you won’t be able to reach your goals without help, so start looking around for people who can assist you. Someone in a position of authority will be glad to help out, but you have to ask them first.
pisces,If you are involved in anything of a creative or artistic nature it is sure to go well over the weekend. Affairs of the heart are also under excellent stars, so get out and about and meet people, because your soul mate is waiting to be found. ,pisces,Go your own way and do your own thing and don’t worry in the slightest what others might think about it. Why should you care about their opinions, especially when almost everything you touch turns to gold? You’re right, they’re wrong, that’s it.
pisces,If someone in a position of authority asks you to do something of a questionable nature today you must turn them down flat. Yes, of course, it could have repercussions as far as your promotion prospects are concerned but principle comes before power.
pisces,Flattery will take you a long way, but hard work will take you even further. Cosmic activity in and around the career area of your chart makes it easy to impress employers and other important people, both with your ideas and with your enthusiasm. ,pisces,If something out of the ordinary occurs you must not take it seriously or personally. Sometimes things happen for no apparent reason and there is no point getting worked up about them, so stay cool and laugh at those who get hysterical. ,pisces,Chances are you will clash with someone in a position of authority today or tomorrow. It is important that you stand your ground and refuse to be intimidated but it is also important that you be ready to meet them halfway if they suggest a compromise. ,pisces,Once again you are allowing yourself to be dragged into situations that are not going to be good for you and it’s got to stop. Make a serious effort to put some distance between yourself and those who would use you for their own ends.
pisces,You have an obsession of some sort that needs to be broken but how do you go about it? One way is to indulge yourself to such an extent that you get sick of it and never want to do it again. Why not give it a try? ,pisces,You may have to get more involved in other people’s problems over the next few days but that is no bad thing. Friends and family need the kind of sensitive input that only a Pisces can provide, so don’t be afraid to tell them what you think.
pisces,A close personal relationship may be going through one of those phases when you don’t know which way is up and which way is down but don’t think of ending it yet. The Sun’s change of signs tomorrow will make things easier for both of you. ,pisces,Someone you meet on your travels today or tomorrow will become not only a good friend but also a partner who can assist with the important projects you’ve got lined up for the future. It seems your needs and their needs are closely related. ,pisces,You may not be the kind of person who enjoys taking risks but you have to be a bit more adventurous now. If you want to get in other people’s good books then do something different, something they would never expect of you.
pisces,You may be tempted to end a relationship of some kind but before you do try looking forward and asking yourself if you may later decide that you have been too hasty. Full moons can play all sorts of tricks on people, so be careful.
pisces,There are occasions when being honest is not the best option and today’s full moon warns that telling the truth may cause more problems than it solves. Does a friend or colleague really want to know what is going on behind their back? Probably not.
pisces,The moment you find yourself focusing too much on details this weekend is the moment when you should make a conscious effort to look at the bigger picture. Without it there is a danger you will lose perspective and drift off course.
pisces,People you deal with in a creative capacity will be hugely impressed by your ideas and your willingness to work with others as part of a team. Just make sure you get full credit for your input – don’t let them steal the glory from you.
pisces,Others may say you have got the wrong end of the stick or are acting irrationally but so what? Most likely they are simply jealous because they are stuck in the past and don’t share your ability to look ahead and see what might be.
pisces,Take what you hear today with a large pinch of salt because someone is trying to mislead you. Even those who can usually be trusted to tell you the truth will be tempted to make things up, just for the fun of it, so stay mentally on guard. ,pisces,You will breeze through life with the greatest of ease over the next 24 hours, especially on the work front where everyone wants to smooth your path and make your day pleasant. Enjoy it while you can – you know it’s unlikely to last. ,pisces,Make sure that your emotions do not get the better of you over the new year period. You are not the only one determined to have a good time – and when different ideas of having a “good time” clash the results can sometimes be messy! ,pisces,Your ability to tune in to other people’s thoughts and feelings will help you tremendously. Not only will it give you an advantage over less sensitive rivals but it will also enable you to reach out and do something for those most in need of assistance.
pisces,Don’t back down if someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time this weekend because that will only encourage them to be even more domineering. Stay calm but, at the same time, speak up and let them know you are not afraid. ,pisces,If you are thinking of taking a vacation then start making plans for later in the year. Even if you cannot get away this very minute you can at least decide where you want to go and when you intend to do so. Follow your dream. ,pisces,There is no reason at all why you should not mix business with pleasure over the next 24 hours, but be careful the pleasure part of the equation does not take over completely. Get your work done first, then reward yourself with a night on the town. ,pisces,You don’t care in the slightest what others think about your behaviour – in fact you will go out of your way to shock over the next 24 hours. Life is too short to waste time wondering if others approve of your words and actions.
pisces,You are in the mood to take a few risks and chances are they will pay off in a big way, especially if you join forces with like-minded people and work together towards a common goal. Anything is possible when you are part of a team. ,pisces,If you are the kind of Pisces who enjoys a challenge you will find lots to occupy your mind over the next 24 hours. But if you are the kind who gets upset when nothing runs smoothly you might like to stay in bed a few hours longer! ,pisces,If you allow yourself to get angry with someone today you will probably go over the top and say things you later regret. Both in your personal life and in your work you must think before you speak. Engage your brain before you open your mouth.
pisces,Your dealings with employers and other important people will improve considerably over the next 48 hours, thanks to Venus, planet of harmony, linking with Saturn, planet of authority. You know just what to say and do to get them on your side. ,pisces,You may believe that you can take whatever fate chooses to throw at you but why make life difficult for yourself? The planets make it easy for you to persuade friends and family members to offer a helping hand. You would be a fool to ignore it.
pisces,There is so much you have to be thankful for and yet for some strange reason you seem determined to focus on the very few things that have gone wrong. It’s time to lighten up a little and let your heart guide you. You will be happier for it.
pisces,Whatever else you get up to today don’t, repeat don’t, take your friends for granted. Those who think highly of you will help you out in any way they can, but if they later discover that you have been playing mind games they won’t be too happy. ,pisces,You will come into contact with someone today who has some amazing ideas and can inspire you to achieve great things. They may not look remarkable at first sight though, so keep your eyes and ears open. Genius comes in all shapes and sizes. ,pisces,No matter how weighed down by duties and responsibilities you may be at the moment you must find ways to get away from your everyday environment. Leave it all behind you for a while and do only what makes you feel good about yourself. ,pisces,If you are told something of a privileged nature you must keep it to yourself. With Mercury, planet of communication, linked to Jupiter, planet of excess, there is a danger you will let slip information that was not yours to divulge. You won’t be confided in again! ,pisces,You may have to amend your plans due to unexpected changes but there is no point getting angry about it. You of all people should know that nothing stays the same for long, that changes are natural and to be welcomed. They will work for your benefit.
pisces,You will receive plenty of advise from friends and colleagues this coming week – and you will ignore it all. You don’t need other people to tell you what needs to be done, you can feel it in your bones. Let that feeling guide you to love and success.
pisces,You will find it easier to get along with employers and other authority figures over the next few days, even those you have clashed with recently. There will still be disagreements, of course, but there will also be more respect in both directions.
pisces,If there is something you need to finish then get it done and dusted today, because when the Sun changes signs tomorrow your mind will be on other things. Over the next few weeks you will spend more time thinking than doing, and that’s no bad thing.
pisces,Pay attention to what happens today and for the remainder of the week – and pay attention to what your inner voice tells you. The more you think about what you are doing now the more enjoyable your life will be when the Sun enters your sign next month.
pisces,You could be a bit too emotional today. You will do yourself a lot of favors if you resist the urge to reply in kind to any adverse comments you receive from those you work or do business with. Count to ten before putting your feelings into words. ,pisces,Your life will change for the better very soon but you should not be waiting for things to happen, you should be making them happen. What takes place today and over the weekend will help you see things in a more positive light. After that it’s up to you.
pisces,There will be chaos in all directions this weekend but you will sail serenely through it all. What is your secret? Most likely you are simply unaware that there is a crisis – and you can’t get uptight about something if you don’t know it exists.
pisces,Don’t be afraid to follow your instincts, even if it puts you at odds with everyone else. If you have a good idea this week, and then neglect to follow it up, you will be kicking yourself mentally for weeks, months, maybe even years to come!,pisces,Now that mind planet Mercury is moving out of its retrograde phase you can start believing in what you are doing. The planets suggest that if you refuse to let go of your dream it will, sooner or later, begin to come true.
pisces,If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. Nothing in life is impossible and if your desire is strong enough you can make it happen. Dare to dream – and dare to believe that dreams really do come true.
pisces,For quite some time you have been fearing the worst but over the next two or three days you will realize that the worst is unlikely to happen – and even if it does it won’t be as bad as your imagination led you to believe. ,pisces,There is something you do better than anyone else and that is what you should be focusing on. If an issue does not concern you directly you must ignore it and concentrate on the things that do. The more narrow your range the more successful you will be. ,pisces,You may be tempted to take some kind of risk today but the planets warn that could be dangerous. What you think is your subconscious mind guiding you is in fact nothing more than wishful thinking. Be happy with what you have got. ,pisces,You will have plenty to say for yourself over the next 48 hours but take care you don’t say too much. According to the planets it will pay you to keep certain thoughts to yourself. Not everyone wants to be told where they are going wrong.
pisces,It might annoy you that a friend or relative is keeping secrets from you but the more you try to find out what they know the more they will delight in teasing you. Pretend you don’t care in the slightest and focus your attention on something else.
pisces,There is a danger today that you will create problems that need not exist. The most useful advice anyone can give you now is to stop pushing so hard and let everyday events guide you. Don’t worry, you’re sure to end up some place good. ,pisces,If trying to figure certain things out gives you a headache then give up. You don’t have to know it all, you don’t have to be the best informed member of the human race. Switch off your brain today and let your mind wander where it will.
pisces,Sometimes you can be a bit too obliging for your own good but that is not an option now. When you realize that you are going to have to fight for what you desire you can and you will throw off that “nice guy” tag once and for all. ,pisces,Negative feelings may be natural but you don’t have to let them take over your life. Certain emotions may be difficult to deal with today but deal with them you must because they have been kept under wraps for too long. Confront whatever it is that pains you. ,pisces,You will have plenty to say for yourself today and over the weekend – but make sure you can back up whatever claims you make with solid facts and figures. Your rivals and enemies will be looking for ways to catch you out. Don’t make it easy for them.
pisces,A friend needs your assistance and, being the nice person you are, you won’t hesitate to help. However, you can also see that their current crisis is largely of their own making and at some stage you are going to have to point out that fact.
pisces,You have been under a lot of pressure in recent weeks, so go easy on yourself for a while. Find a quiet place where you can relax and think through the many changes that have taken place in your life. You need to make sense of it all.
pisces,Why do you hesitate to take action? It’s not like you to think twice before rushing in but for some reason you want to know what lies ahead before making your move. On this occasion you could be right, there could be danger round the next corner.
pisces,It is inevitable that you will encounter some kind of resistance over the next 24 hours. It may be emotional resistance or it may be physical resistance but either way you will have to find an alternative route to your chosen destination. ,pisces,If you feel a touch depressed at the moment you should dress sharp and hit the town with your friends. A night out with your group will take your mind off your worries and remind you how many good things, and good people, there are in your life.
pisces,It will be easy to feel sorry for yourself today but it would also be a crime to waste your time and your energy on needless self-pity. If you feel a bit down you must do whatever it takes to snap yourself out of it. Strive to be happy. ,pisces,At this time of year, more than most, your imagination is strong, so take part in something of a creative or artistic nature. Writing, dancing and singing are all well starred today and over the weekend, so get out there and put on a show. ,pisces,The more others demand that you change your ways to suit their needs this weekend the more you must dig in your heels and refuse to budge. You are right to be stubborn. Let the world know you will not be bullied, not now, not ever.
pisces,You need to take a more relaxed attitude to what you think you have to do today and throughout the week. Is it really so urgent that you have to take care of it now? What might an extra big push do to your health? Most likely it can wait.
pisces,All the petty upsets and restrictions of the past few months are beginning to fade and by the time the Sun moves into your birth sign on Friday you will be king, or queen, of the castle again. Always look forward. Never look back. ,pisces,Let where you are going, rather than where you are coming from, be your guide. The choices you make over the next few days will influence your life for months to come, so make them wisely and refuse to be weighed down by the past. ,pisces,You are at a turning point in the year and when the Sun enters your sign tomorrow you will enjoy a surge of energy. Today, however, you should take things easy and make your final plans. And final means final – no more chopping and changing. ,pisces,The Sun’s move into your sign today means the time has come to show the world what you can do. You won’t lack for energy or enthusiasm and you must use them to pursue excellence in everything you do. You won’t just shine Pisces, you’ll dazzle! ,pisces,Do you possess the facts to justify the suspicions you have about someone you work or do business with? Most likely you do not, so tread carefully because if you make accusations you cannot prove you may regret it before the end of the month. ,pisces,Others can get emotional if they want to but you must keep your head at all times and in all situations. That won’t be easy as the full moon gets stronger but compared to family and friends you’ve got it easy, so stay calm and help where you can.
pisces,What occurs over the next 24 to 48 hours will bring into the open a conflict that has been simmering for quite some time. That’s good. The more you try to deny that it exists the worse it will get in the long-term. Deal with it now. ,pisces,Yesterday’s full moon in your opposite sign is still having an effect, not least by stirring up old rivalries. There may be a few harsh words today but you must not hold any grudges. In the greater scheme of things none of it is of real importance.
pisces,Now that the full moon has started to fade you can look back on your words and actions of the past few days and see how they were driven by emotion rather than logic. You may need to backtrack on some of the things you promised! ,pisces,Don’t give away too much information about your plans. Play your cards close to your chest and keep those you work and do business with guessing as to what your next move might be. The less they know the bigger your personal advantage will be. ,pisces,Your mind is being overwhelmed by so much senseless chatter. What you need most now is to find a quiet place where you can be on your own, a sacred spot where you can get your thoughts together. Look for it and you will find it.
pisces,With the Sun linked to your ruler Neptune in your own sign anything and everything is possible for you this weekend. Whatever it is that inspires you don’t be afraid to follow it all the way. The cosmic powers that be are looking over you.
pisces,The Sun in your sign will give you a huge boost over the next few days. Even if you are the kind of Pisces who sees the glass as half empty you will be uncharacteristically positive this week. Put simply, you can do no wrong – so be amazing.
pisces,It is important that you treat someone fairly, even if they do not fully deserve it. Yes, they have broken the rules, but if you look at their situation with a little more sympathy you may find they did not really have much of a choice.
pisces,Yesterday’s full moon in your opposite sign is still having an effect, not least by stirring up old rivalries. There may be a few harsh words today but you must not hold any grudges. In the greater scheme of things none of it is of real importance.
pisces,Forget about what might have been and focus on what can still be done. The Sun in your sign urges you to stop worrying and take each day as it comes. There is already a plan guiding your life – all you have to do is follow it.
pisces,There will be changes in your money situation today and over the weekend. Whether they are good changes or bad changes remains to be seen but if you approach what happens in a sensible manner you won’t be out of pocket for long.
pisces,No matter how tough the challenge you face today and over the weekend you will come through with flying colors. Mars in the sympathetic sign of Scorpio endows you with the kind of self-belief that can moves mountains – or make a fortune.
pisces,The planets warn if you try to get through a task too quickly you may have to go back and do it all over again. A little bit of thought now will save a lot of time and effort later on. Self-discipline plus staying power equals success.
pisces,You will have some remarkable ideas over the next few days and at least one of them will be so good that you can build a career around it, if you so wish. It’s not true that Pisces is never ambitious, as you are about to remind us.
pisces,Nothing is impossible for you now. With the Sun making an excellent link to power planet Pluto you can move mountains if you so choose. A more productive aim might be to bring together people in pursuit of a common aim. You can change the world.
pisces,It’s okay to win, of course, but where you finish in the race is less important than the fun you had taking part. The planets urge you to let go of your competitive instincts today, because in a strange way they may be holding you back.
pisces,Today’s solar eclipse in your sign makes you feel good about yourself and about the future. There may be a nagging doubt in the back of your mind that you don’t deserve to be this happy but you must ignore it. You deserve it all – and more.
pisces,The positive effects of yesterday’s eclipse will linger for a few days yet, so get out into the world and show what you can do – which is almost anything. By the end of the week you will look, feel and act like a completely new person. ,pisces,It may annoy you that certain people are trying to keep you out of the information loop but what happens today will reveal why they found it so hard to confide in you. Maybe they thought you would not approve. Maybe they were right. ,pisces,With Venus joining the Sun in your birth sign today you can now add charm to your already vast array of talents. You can also splash out on someone you have feelings for. A small gift from you, chosen with care, will mean so much to them.
pisces,It is essential that you start the week in the right frame of mind but as Mercury is at odds with somber Saturn that may not be easy. What happens later in the week will sweep away your worries but, in the meantime, strive to stay cool.
pisces,A situation that has been bugging you for weeks must be dealt with today and positive cosmic activity in your own sign will help you get to the root of the problem. Don’t be too eager though. Take your time and make the right decisions.
pisces,At some point you will decide that it is better to back down than to risk making enemies of people who have more power than you. It’s not cowardly, it’s common sense. Besides, what you are arguing about today will be irrelevant tomorrow. ,pisces,Start thinking of ways to boost your income. Some of your money-making ideas may be a bit far-fetched but that’s okay – better that you explore all possibilities than none at all. The Sun’s change of signs on the 20th will point you in the right direction. ,pisces,If the route you were planning to take is blocked don’t get angry about it – most likely it is the universe’s way of telling you that you should be taking a different path. Few things in life happen without a reason, so take the hint! ,pisces,By all means show sympathy for someone who is finding the going tough at the moment, and do what you can to help them in practical ways, but do not lend them money or take on their commitments yourself. That’s just asking for trouble. ,pisces,A financial opportunity of some kind will come your way this weekend, but it will be up to you to make something of it. Fortunately, you are the kind of person who believes in working for what you get, so this should be a profitable time.
pisces,Over the next few days you will get a clearer idea of what needs to be done to boost your income and make sure you don’t get into debt again. Start by seeing less of people who encourage you to spend big. You can’t afford their friendship.
pisces,The Sun has left your birth sign but that does not mean you will suddenly lose energy or start slowing down. On the contrary, you have built up so much momentum that you will find it easy to keep moving at speed – until something trips you up!,pisces,You may crave security but you must not give away your freedom in return. Once you give other people permission to make choices and decisions for you it will be very hard should you ever want to change back. Bear that fact in mind today. ,pisces,Others trust you to tell them the truth, no matter how painful it may be. Today, however, it might be wise to avoid being so direct, because loved ones need to have their confidence built up, not torn down even more. Bend the truth just a little bit,pisces,You need to go on the attack today and let people know that you are not the sort to back down when you know you are right. On the work front, especially, you must not allow yourself to be intimidated. There is nothing to fear. ,pisces,Changes are generally good for you but with Saturn now turning retrograde it might be wise to keep things as they are for the time being. Above all, don’t try to force what does not need forcing or fix what does not need fixing. ,pisces,Other people’s negative comments may be hurtful but they can also be useful in that they motivate you to accomplish what they believe you are incapable of doing. If you can dream it you can do it – it really is as simple as that. ,pisces,What you are offered over the next 48 hours may seem too good to be true but the fact is you have earned it. At some point in the recent past you have done good deeds for others and now they want to do good deeds for you.
pisces,Whatever your differences with a friend or colleague may be you must ignore them today, because they are not worth risking your long-term relationship for. You may not see eye-to-eye on everything but you still make a pretty good team. ,pisces,You can be the best. You can reach the top. No matter how many times in the past your dream has been dashed you will get another chance over the next few days, so be ready and act swiftly when the wheel of fate turns. Be amazing!,pisces,Thoughts and feelings that you have kept to yourself for quite some time will soon have to be made public. Make sure you put them across in a friendly and matter-of-fact manner. The last thing you need is to provoke a negative reaction. ,pisces,The events of your life are, to a large extent, the result of your own thought processes: if you expect the best, you get the best; if you expect the worst, you get the worst. Your mind really does create your world – so create a world you can love.
pisces,There are more important things in life than money and what happens over the next few days will in some way or other prove that point. Your attitude toward material things will change for the better, and your relationships will improve as a result. ,pisces,Don’t be afraid to approach someone who can help you financially. Whatever it is that you need, speak up and make sure those who hold the purse strings know what it is they can do to help. They may surprise you and do it.
pisces,If certain people seem to be staying out of your way perhaps you should ask yourself why that is. Most likely it is because you have been a bit too aggressive of late. You will get more done, and have more fun, if you make nice.
pisces,Go out of your way to be nice to people today, even the ones who don’t deserve it. By changing your attitude toward them, even if it is only an act, you will help them change too and, who knows, you might one day be genuine friends. ,pisces,You need to do something about your money situation, that much is obvious, but try not to be too drastic about it. Above all don’t be tempted to sell off things that you may need later on. It will cost you a fortune to buy them back again! ,pisces,You should know by now that no matter what you do and no matter how well you do it certain people will always complain. Instead of trying to please others why not please yourself for a change? Ignore the critics and do what gives you pleasure.
pisces,No matter how much you need to boost your income you must not let others know that you are desperate, or they will have you working twice as hard for half as much. Next time, try not to get so heavily in debt!,pisces,You are under a lot of pressure at the moment but if you approach what you have to do in a light-hearted manner you will find you quite enjoy the challenge. You may also see a business opportunity that everyone else has missed.
pisces,Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart has not exactly done wonders for your confidence of late but that’s okay. A week from now the Sun will move in your favor and all things will be possible. Look forward to that.
pisces,Your instincts should be telling you to steer clear of get-rich-quick schemes, and if they are not then the planets most certainly are. You may be desperate to find ways to make money but don’t worry, you won’t be poor for long. ,pisces,You are allowed to indulge yourself – it isn’t a crime. Jupiter’s influence will help you to appreciate the finer things in life over the next few days. You can enjoy them on your own or with that special person who shares your passion for life. ,pisces,If you have important decisions to make it might be best to put them off until after the 19th, when the Sun changes signs. Only then will you be in the right frame of mind to see things clearly. Act too soon and it could cost you dear.
pisces,You are unlikely to be in the mood to give in over a partnership matter of some kind this weekend. But is it really worth carrying on a feud over something that in the greater scheme of things is so petty? Probably not. Find a compromise.
pisces,By now you will have discovered that you placed too much faith in a particular individual, but there is no point getting upset about it. One of the very best times of the year is about to begin, so think only uplifting thoughts.
pisces,Your mood will improve considerably over the next 24 hours, as will your willingness to be more sociable. If you make an effort to get out and about, meet new people and visit new places you will soon be having the time of your life.
pisces,There is no point being subtle about what you desire to say: speak up and make sure everyone gets the message. Some people, sadly, are just too stupid to take a hint, so spell it out for them so there is no danger of misunderstanding.
pisces,The more serious you have been in recent weeks, especially about work and finances, the more you will want to have fun now. The Sun in Taurus will bring all sorts of social invitations and you won’t want to turn any of them down. ,pisces,Today’s full moon may incline you to believe that even friends are conspiring against you but it isn’t true. What is true is that you are more touchy than usual, but if you stand back from your life you will see you have nothing to worry about.
pisces,Developments on the work front may be getting you down a little, not least because employers and senior colleagues seem unaware of your needs. Chances are the situation is not as dire as you imagine, so cheer up and enjoy the weekend.
pisces,If you get the chance to move up in the world over the next few days you must take it without a second thought or a backward glance. Don’t worry that you may have to take on more responsibility – you will handle it with ease. ,pisces,Tread carefully when dealing with people in positions of power. Yes, they may be encouraging you to speak up and say what you mean but the planets warn they don’t really mean it. If you tell it like it is you could soon be looking for a new job! ,pisces,The old way of doing things may be the safe way but it is not necessarily the best way and with the planets urging you to use your imagination you should be trying things you never attempted before. It will be fun and it could make you money. ,pisces,You will get the chance to move up in the world in some way today and you must take it. It may be a small step in itself but small steps often turn into big steps and before you know it you could be on a much higher level.
pisces,You may have to cuts corners and bend rules to get what you want today. This is one of those occasions where, if you play it by the book, there is no chance of meeting your deadline or reaching your goal. Risks will have to be taken.
pisces,You must give yourself a break today and over the weekend, for the sake of your physical, mental and emotional health. The planets warn that the more you put in now the less you will get out later, so you may as well stop altogether.
pisces,An issue that has caused you some anguish will no longer bother you in the slightest now that Venus, planet of harmony, is moving in your favor again. In turn you will no longer judge people who think, feel and act in ways that are alien to you.
pisces,Make having fun your aim this week. You have done enough thinking and worrying of late and now that the Sun and Venus are moving through one of the more sociable areas of your chart you can and you must let your hair down.
pisces,You will have lots to say for yourself this week and that’s good because some of your ideas are brilliant. The bigger the noise you make the better, because people in positions of power like that sort of thing. Turn up the volume!,pisces,Try to take it in the right spirit if certain people make fun of you today. Fortunately, today’s Sun-Jupiter link will help you see the funny side of what happens, even if it is happening to you. Laugh and the world will laugh with you. ,pisces,Someone who has supported you in the past will refuse to do so today, and with good reason. It seems they can see what you cannot, that you are aiming too high and cannot possibly succeed. Listen to them and you won’t fall so far.
pisces,Keep your eye on the bigger picture today, because if you get bogged down in details you will surely get lost. You will find it quite easy to persuade others to do things for you, so let friends and colleagues sweat the small stuff. ,pisces,You will find it much easier to get your message across while the moon is new, even more so if it is a message of love and laughter. Don’t spend all your time chatting on social media though – get out into the real world for a while.
pisces,If you find that you are hurting physically over the coming days it can only be because you are doing something wrong. The reason you feel pain is that both your mind and your body are protesting, so take the hint and be kind to yourself.
pisces,The time is right to get together with like-minded people and do something that makes the world a better place. Your compassionate nature will guide you to where you can most be of service and your organizational skills will help make things happen.
pisces,A relationship may have gone through a rocky phase in recent weeks but the worst is over and as from today you will be able to step back from your differences and see them for what they really are: phantoms that don’t really exist.
pisces,If your inner voice tells you to go out and enjoy yourself then that is exactly what you must do. It’s not a request, it’s an order, one that comes from the deepest, truest part of your nature. Listen to the real you – it knows what you want. ,pisces,You may be generous by nature but that does not mean you should throw money at people like the stuff is going out of fashion. In fact the planets warn you may need to dip into your savings over the next few days. Do you have any? ,pisces,It may seem as if everyone is against you but what happens over the next 24 hours will convince you that there is always someone you can turn to for advice. You have plenty of friends – and not nearly as many enemies as you fear. ,pisces,You must resist the temptation to take unnecessary risks, especially with money. No matter how much you think the odds are stacked in your favor something is sure to happen that upsets your calculations. Keep your cash in your pocket.
pisces,Don’t sit at home wondering what is going on in the world – get out there and find out! Wherever you go and whatever you do this weekend you are guaranteed a good time, so seek out like-minded people and do things together that you all enjoy. ,pisces,It may seem that you don’t have a care in the world but deep down there is something you are worried about and you must deal with it soon. Face it head-on before the Sun changes signs on the 20th and it won’t be such an ordeal. ,pisces,No doubt you have a dozen and one jobs to take care of but if you don’t feel like working hard then you really don’t have to. The planets warn if you don’t take a break now you could break down completely later on. Be kind to yourself.
pisces,Your emotions are closer to the surface than you realize and the nearer you get to the weekend, when the moon is full, the more likely it is your feelings will get the better of you. Strive to stay calm and see the funny side of all situations. ,pisces,Travel and social activities are well starred at the moment and if you are on the move today or tomorrow you could meet someone who changes your life for the better. It’s quite possible that you could change their life too. You’re good for each other.
pisces,Loved ones will demand that you attend to their needs ahead of your own today, and if you are smart you will do so without complaint. The more you support them now the more they will support you later on when the roles are reversed.
pisces,What seems like a minor event today will take on a life of its own over the weekend, so don’t make too many plans because chances are you will have to cancel them. Be open to new possibilities and welcome new people into your life. ,pisces,Put yourself out for other people and make sacrifices without being asked. You may not get much by way of thanks for your efforts but the inner glow you feel for having done the right thing will make up for it. You’re a nice person to know. ,pisces,Things could get a bit stressful over the next 24 hours, especially if you are the sort of Pisces who expects everything in your life to go according to plan. For best results, live in the moment. Looking further ahead than that is a waste of time. ,pisces,Yes, you have spent too much in recent weeks but, no, you don’t have to tighten your belt so hard that you can hardly breathe. Just cut back on luxuries for a while until you get your cashflow situation back under control.
pisces,You don’t have to be aggressive to get what you want – in fact that could be counter-productive. Use your ability to look into the minds and hearts of those around you to find out what motivates them – then use that information for your own benefit.
pisces,Watch what you say today, especially when dealing with senior colleagues and people in positions of power. Your words may be true but that won’t count for much if they think you are being critical or sarcastic. Best not to say anything at all. ,pisces,Don’t be tempted to do things today just to get yourself noticed. You don’t need to call attention to yourself, still less to put on a show. You know what you are capable of and that’s all that matters – you don’t have to prove your worth. ,pisces,It may come as a shock to find that you cannot proceed any further in a particular direction but you are advised not to push the matter. The cosmic powers that be will deal with the obstruction but it may take a while. In the meantime, relax! ,pisces,Someone will try to convert you to their way of thinking over the next 48 hours but you must not be persuaded. The moment you agree to toe the party line is the moment you hand control of your life over to them. Don’t do it! ,pisces,You may be angry that someone you thought you could trust has let you down but don’t waste any more time on them. Great things are possible, even without their support. All you need is the confidence to act on your own.
pisces,A domestic issue that has been causing you problems will resolve itself either today or during the early part of the new week. The lesson you most need to learn from the situation is that everything works out for the best in the end. ,pisces,Something you thought was going wrong will suddenly come together and make sense and you will be amazed to realize there was never any doubt that you would succeed in the end. Next time, try not to take such a pessimistic viewpoint. ,pisces,Don’t let it worry you if a loved one seems to take the opposite view to everything you say because they probably don’t mean it. Focus on your work over the next 24 hours because that is where you will make the most satisfying progress.
pisces,Something unexpected will disrupt your day and you won’t be too happy about it, but it won’t help if you lose your cool and start screaming and shouting. You should be experienced enough and mature enough to take setbacks like this in your stride.
pisces,You will need to think quickly and act quickly to get on top of a situation that is rapidly spiralling out of control. Don’t worry if you have to tread on a few toes to get things done – everyone will thank you later for taking the lead.
pisces,You will need to think quickly and act quickly to get on top of a situation that is rapidly spiralling out of control. Don’t worry if you have to tread on a few toes to get things done – everyone will thank you later for taking the lead.
pisces,Play it cool this week and don’t worry about what your friends are doing. It is always a mistake to compare yourself to others and it would be even more of a mistake now that the moon is new. Be yourself – it’s who you were meant to be. ,pisces,You need to put your foot down and let certain people know that there will be no more free rides. They have already benefited massively from your generosity, so any obligation you may have had to them is no longer valid. Look out for yourself.
pisces,If you keep your head over the next few days you will make a big impression on people in positions of power. Others will come to rely on you more than they have in the past and that in turn will put you in a very strong position.
pisces,If you show your hand too early today you could make it easier for your rivals to put one over on you. Keep your aims secret. Don’t tell anyone anything they do not need to know. That applies to your personal life as well as to business matters.
pisces,Try not to be sentimental about possessions because it is quite likely that you will have to let go of something you value today. Is your attachment to it logical or sentimental? Most likely it’s the latter and you don’t really need it at all. ,pisces,You need to put your personal feelings to one side and work with people you may not get along with on a one-to-one level but whose professional expertise you are going to need. You don’t have to like them but you do have to respect them.
pisces,You may be tempted to give up on a project that seems to be going nowhere but you must give it a bit longer. Having put so much time and effort into it already a few more days won’t hurt – and might make all the difference.
pisces,You are having second thoughts about something that only a short while ago was of huge importance to you. Most likely you can now see that you endowed it with too much meaning – but it still has some meaning, so don’t be too hasty. ,pisces,Neptune, your ruler, urges you to put your skills and talents to work in support of a cause of some kind. Don’t listen to those who say you should not get involved – if others are hurting then you cannot stand by and let it continue.
pisces,You need to start thinking about where you want to be a year or so from now, then you need to start mapping out the route that will take you most directly from here to there. Careful planning is the key to long-term and lasting success. ,pisces,You may think that someone in your working environment has got it in for you but most likely you are reading into the situation antagonisms that do not exist. Think only the best of people today, and they will do their best for you. ,pisces,Be honest about your desires. With values planet Venus about to move into the most dynamic area of your chart there is almost nothing you can say that will make a bad impression or turn others against you. Take note of that word “almost” though! ,pisces,Venus, planet of affection, moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today and relationships of all kinds will be a joy. Any lingering worries you had that a special person does not like you as much as you like them will be swept away.
pisces,Everything you say and do now must be backed up by the facts. Wishful thinking can be fun but if you take decisions on the basis of what you would like to see happen you are asking for trouble – and this weekend you are likely to get it!,pisces,One of the best times of the year begins for you tomorrow when the Sun moves into the most creative and dynamic area of your chart. What you do with it is up to you but you must do something. Make every day, hour and even minute count.
pisces,The Sun in Cancer as from today will boost your confidence and make it easy for you to look on the bright side of life. Affairs of the heart are especially well starred, so don’t be shy – let the object of your affection know how you feel about them.
pisces,You will find it easy to make friends and influence people over the next 24 hours, so if there is someone you want to impress speak up and let them know what your plans are. You may be surprised how supportive they are of your aims. ,pisces,It’s not like you to be super logical but that does seem to be the case at the moment. The only danger is that you will follow the “facts” and completely ignore what your inner voice is telling you. Are they really facts, or just clever fantasies? ,pisces,Try to stay on good terms with partners and colleagues today, because if you fall out now you will surely regret it later on. Whatever nasty things may have been done to you, be they real or imagined, you will gain more if you forgive and forget. ,pisces,The right thing seems to be happening at the right time now and you must make the most of it. If there is something you want to accomplish or someone you want to get close to, then make your move quickly. It’s now or never.
pisces,The message of the stars this weekend is that you should be more trusting of other people, even those who have let you down in the past. The fact is they would like to make it up to you, but for that you need to give them a chance.
pisces,No matter how much someone says you must help them out you can and you must refuse. That may sound ruthless but how else are they going to learn to look after themselves? And how else are you going to get the rest you need?,pisces,You have had your fill of talk and you have had your fill of trying to plan things out carefully so you don’t hurt other people’s feelings. Now you are going to take decisive action. If others get in the way that’s their problem. ,pisces,It’s not often you ignore your instincts but you could be a bit too cautious for your own good today. If common sense tells you that certain things are not possible you should ignore them. Your inner voice is telling you something quite different.
pisces,This can be and should be a highly productive time of year for you but don’t try too hard. Good things and good people will come your way whether or not you make much of an effort, so sit back and let life carry you along. ,pisces,You may think that a change of direction is what you need, and you may be right, but you are advised not to make any decisions about it yet. The planets are playing havoc with your ability to think straight, so make minor adjustments only.
pisces,No matter how much others try to persuade you to take sides in a dispute you must stay out of it. The simple fact is there is no way of knowing for sure who is right and who is wrong, so it’s best not to get personally involved.
pisces,Don’t make life more complicated than it needs to be. Employers and other important people, and loved ones too, will appreciate your ability to get tasks done without making a big issue of them. Life is simple when reduced to its essentials. ,pisces,What seems such a difficult problem now will look ridiculously easy as from tomorrow, thanks to a new moon in the most dynamic and decisive area of your chart. New moons bring new opportunities, so keep your eyes open and be ready to act. ,pisces,Creative activities and affairs of the heart will go well over the next few days, so focus on what inspires you the most and avoid anything of a repetitive nature. The most important thing now is that you get some excitement in your life.
pisces,Treat a friend or work colleague with compassion today, even if you doubt they deserve it. Yes, they have broken the rules but most likely it is only a minor transgression, so why get worked up about it? Worse things happen. Let it go. ,pisces,You are feeling a lot more positive about life now the Sun is moving in your favor, and with Mars and Venus also on your side today your self-belief is sky-high. What would you do if you knew you could not fail? So do it!,pisces,You have done a lot of soul-searching of late and have reached some interesting conclusions. Now you need to apply what you have learned, even if it means bringing about the kind of upheavals you usually try to avoid. Change is good for you. ,pisces,Cosmic activity in your fellow Water sign of Cancer means it is okay to put your own needs first – in fact it’s essential. It’s good that you want to help people in need but you can help them better in the long-term if you stay healthy and strong.
pisces,It may at times seem as if your talents are being wasted but it isn’t true – and what happens over the next few days will convince you that everything is working out exactly as it should. You are about to discover the role you were born to play.
pisces,Challenges are opportunities in disguise and with the planets very much on your side at the moment if you face challenges bravely over the coming week you will do better than anyone expected. You have what it takes to be the best.
pisces,You will enjoy a surge of energy and enthusiasm today and you must use it to further your ambitions. A creative project begun over the next 24 hours will get everyone talking, and maybe make you some much needed cash as well.
pisces,The next few days are going to be busy and you will need a clear head if you want to make a good impression. If you have made a promise to a friend or a family member you must deliver on it – there can be no excuses.
pisces,You may not enjoy being the center of attention but you must express yourself creatively today. Whatever comes most naturally to you is what you should be doing now, and you should be doing it in the spotlight. You DO have star quality! ,pisces,You may be a creature of habit but you are also capable of adapting to changing circumstances and even enjoying them, so don’t worry if forces over which you have no control disrupt your well-planned routine. In the long-term it will do you good.
pisces,Are you any closer to reaching the targets you set yourself around this time last year? If the answer is Yes, carry on. If the answer is No then you will need to lower your sights. Goals are not set in stone – you can change them as you go along.
pisces,You will find yourself attracted to someone new on your social scene this weekend. It may be the start of a lasting romance, or it may be just a passing fancy, but either way life will be a lot of fun over the next 48 hours. Lucky you.
pisces,Whatever it is you most desire you will find a way to get it over the coming week. The Sun in Cancer at this time of year makes you dynamic in the extreme and not even the upcoming full moon can stop you. Follow your heart in all things.
pisces,Be careful that in your desire to pull ahead of your rivals you don’t overlook an important detail, one that could have a lasting effect on your long-term success, or lack of it. It is often the little things in life that trip us up the most.
pisces,You will face some sort of opposition today because of the full moon but you are strong enough to deal with it. There is no point arguing with people whose way of looking at the world is very different to your own. Just ignore them.
pisces,You may be inspired to get things done but don’t expect partners and colleagues to be as motivated as you. Not everyone shares your Pisces passion and this could be one of those days when it is better to do things on your own. ,pisces,There has been a spring in your step and a song in your heart in recent weeks, and long may your good mood continue, but as from tomorrow you will need to get a bit more serious. People are depending on you, so don’t let them down. ,pisces,It does not matter how many obstacles are placed in your path over the next few days, you will overcome them all with ease. Don’t worry if the mountain you have been tasked to climb looks huge – you will find a way to move it. ,pisces,An invitation that comes out of the blue this weekend will be tempting but because you don’t much like the person who is sending it you may decline. That would be a mistake. Go along for the ride – it won’t be as bumpy as you feared.
pisces,You need to pay more attention to your health and the very first thing you must do is to cut back on your commitments. As usual you are doing too many things for too many people. Try doing less for them and more for yourself.
pisces,No matter how impatient you may be to get started on a new plan or project you should wait a bit. The current cosmic outlook makes you rather careless, even reckless, so take your time and get it right. There’s no need to hurry.
pisces,The current cosmic set-up may make it appear as if partners and work colleagues have got it in for you but have they really or is it you who is overreacting? Most likely it’s the latter, so don’t take anything (especially yourself) too seriously.
pisces,There are a lot of routine chores that need to be dealt with and you are not looking forward to them. However, if you ask friends to help you there is no reason why you should not get through them all in just a few hours. ,pisces,It may feel as if you are running out of time and must act with the utmost urgency but is that really the case? The simple fact is time never runs out – you will always get another chance a little bit further down the road. Stay calm.
pisces,Go out of your way to make other people feel good about themselves. Not only will it cheer them up but it will cheer you up as well. The more you get out into the world and take part in events the more alive you will feel. ,pisces,The old ways may not always be the best but that does not mean you should throw out what you are familiar with. Stick to tried and trusted methods this week. They may at times be boring but at least you know they work.
pisces,The old ways may not always be the best but that does not mean you should throw out what you are familiar with. Stick to tried and trusted methods this week. They may at times be boring but at least you know they work.
pisces,The most important thing now is that you trust other people, because if you let your suspicions get the better of you it’s possible you will miss out on something good. Don’t be so defensive – people are more friendly than you think.
pisces,You will push yourself above and beyond your usual limits today, but once you have reached your goal you must stop there and go no further. A new moon in the health area of your chart demands you take time out to rest and relax.
pisces,Let everyone know where you are coming from and where you intend to go. They may not agree with your choice of destination but they won’t be able to stop you. No one but you has the right to decide where you seek happiness. ,pisces,If you cut corners or bend rules today the powers that be will come down on you hard. Be inventive by all means but be aware that not everyone shares your sometimes cavalier approach to getting things done. Do the right thing the right way. ,pisces,Forget about your worries and woes, in fact forget about anything but having a good time with the one you love. No matter how far apart you may have drifted in recent weeks you now have the chance to kiss and make up. Take it.
pisces,Don’t worry if your actions annoy other people – you don’t need their approval. On the other hand, don’t go looking for confrontation either. Be the boss of your own life but accept that some people will want to do it differently to you.
pisces,Go out of your way to make other people feel good about themselves. Not only will it cheer them up but it will cheer you up as well. The more you get out into the world and take part in events the more alive you will feel.
pisces,You need to make a once and for all decision about the direction your life is heading. That means deciding what is of most importance to you: your family or your career. Deep down you know the answer already – you just need to admit it to yourself.
pisces,Ignore those who say the world is not as good now as it was in the past. They don’t know what they are talking about. And a positive attitude from you will go a long way to making it an even better world tomorrow. Keep smiling.
pisces,Raise your sights over the next 24 hours and see all the major things that are going on in the world around you – things in which you could be and should be playing a part. The world needs people with your generosity of spirit.
pisces,You may be able to finish most tasks in record quick time today but there are some things you must proceed slowly with. Make sure you know all the facts before proceeding with a plan that could make you, but also cost you, a lot of money.
pisces,Try not to take anything too seriously today. There is no point getting angry about developments you do not agree with because you are dealing with forces that are too big to control or to change. For the time being at least, go with the flow. ,pisces,Now that Saturn is moving in your favor again you can, with a little bit of effort, move up in the world quite rapidly. But don’t get greedy and try to have it all. There is no need to burden yourself with too much responsibility.
pisces,The upcoming full moon will in some way remind you that you can never truly be in control of events. The best way to get through the coming week is to take each day, hour and minute as it comes. Go with the flow and live in the now. ,pisces,You may look calm on the outside but on the inside your emotions are raging. Therefore your first task today is to find ways to let your anger out in a controlled manner. Your second task is to stop taking life so seriously.
pisces,Where work and money matters are concerned this is the ideal time to push yourself just a little bit harder because the extra effort will pay off in a big way in the weeks and months to come. Be bold and make things happen.
pisces,If you need assistance today don’t be afraid to approach people who can give it to you. Even the most talented Pisces needs a helping hand once in a while and teamwork is essential if you are to make meaningful progress. ,pisces,You are taking certain situations and certain individuals far too seriously. You need to remind yourself that in the greater scheme of things nothing is worth getting worked up about and nothing is ever as bad as it seems. Believe it – it’s true.
pisces,The old solar cycle is coming to an end and in a matter of days a new and more positive cycle will begin, for you at least, so don’t take on any new tasks or chores because you are unlikely to have the time to finish them.
pisces,You know that you have what it takes to succeed, so what are you waiting for? As from today you will find it easier to persuade people in positions of power to look on you favorably. Just remember they respect actions more than words.
pisces,You have to accept that people you deal with on a one-to-one level have the upper hand at the moment. The good news is if things go right you will share in the credit, but if they go wrong it won’t be you who gets the blame.
pisces,Try not to fall into the trap of thinking that those who disagree with you are your enemies. It’s far more likely they are your friends. The Sun in your opposite sign means you must meet others halfway. Life is not a war.
pisces,The Sun in your opposite sign puts the emphasis on partnerships and if you are wise you will make a serious effort to get along with the people around you. Find areas where your interests and their interests coincide. You can only do so much alone.
pisces,You need to assert yourself more and with Mars strong in the career area of your chart right now that should not be too difficult. Make sure those who have been taking you for granted get the message that you are no longer such an easy touch.
pisces,Someone in a position of authority will give you a hard time today but you won’t let it get to you. On the contrary, you will let certain people know that you’ve had your fill of being bossed about. Take the fight to them for a change.
pisces,You will insist on doing what has to be done by yourself and with no interference over the next 48 hours. And quite right too. Your talents and skills are such that others should be taking instructions from you, not the other way round.
pisces,If you owe someone a favor you must pay it off quickly, because the longer you leave it the more they will want. The opposite applies too: if you have done a good deed for someone now is the time to demand they do a good deed for you.
pisces,Cosmic activity in your opposite sign means you will be more expressive romantically over the coming week. There could even be a new relationship around the time of the solar eclipse on Thursday, so be open to people who approach you out of the blue.
pisces,If you have been financially wasteful of late the consequences will be apparent over the next 24 hours. You will be given a chance to make up some of what you have lost but only if you are willing to sacrifice other things that you treasure.
pisces,According to the planets you are taking too narrow a viewpoint of certain situations and certain individuals. Even a slight change of perspective on your part today will lead to a new, improved and more enjoyable way of looking at the world. ,pisces,Because today’s eclipse falls in the partnership area of your chart you will find it easy to persuade friends and loved ones and work colleagues to see things your way. That does not, of course, mean that your way is always the right way! ,pisces,Communication blocks that have come between you and other people in recent weeks will be swept away today and over the weekend. Don’t worry that someone might hold a grudge against you – your Pisces charm will win them round.
pisces,Although the Sun in Virgo at this time of year brings partnership matters to a head it also provides you with the tools to resolve them, so don’t be too cynical and don’t be too eager to say goodbye. Instead, why not kiss and make up?,pisces,You must ask partners and loved ones and work colleagues for their permission before you do things for them, especially if their pride is strong. You know what your reaction would be if someone made decisions for you without consulting you first! ,pisces,Common sense should tell you that the best place for your cash is in your pocket and if it doesn’t tell you then the planets most certainly do. You’re not a mug, so don’t behave like one and let others get rich at your expense.
pisces,You need to be more assertive, especially if you have got into the habit of letting other people make decisions for you. It may be easy to let partners and loved ones do as they please but if it doesn’t please you too then what is the point? ,pisces,Don’t take what happens today too seriously because in the greater scheme of things it is of minor importance. That applies in particular to what occurs on the work front. No matter how disruptive it may be just let it go over your head.
pisces,Something that has been worrying you for months will resolve itself to your complete satisfaction over the next few days and most likely you will kick yourself mentally for having allowed your fears to get out of hand. Don’t be too hard on yourself. ,pisces,You would be wise to get expert advice before taking risks with your money and possessions. You may feel you cannot lose – and you may be right – but why take the chance when you don’t have to? Professionals are less likely to make silly mistakes. ,pisces,Try not to reveal too much about yourself over the next few days. With Neptune, your ruler, at odds with Saturn your rivals and enemies will happily seize on anything they think might make you look bad. Keep your secrets to yourself.
pisces,At some stage today or tomorrow you will realize that you are putting far more into a relationship than you are getting out of it. That cannot be allowed to continue. Get tough if you have to – sadly it’s the only language some people understand.
pisces,If you want to get things done you will have to work closely with other people over the next few days. An upcoming eclipse in your sign could derail your plans if you insist on going it alone. Share the burdens and share the spoils too.
pisces,A clash of wills is likely today as the Sun and Mars square up across two of the most important areas of your chart. Stand up for what you believe in but don’t get so aggressive about it that you risk making long-term enemies.
pisces,If you recently said something that upset a friend or loved one you can expect to hear all about it over the next few days. Don’t make matters worse by arguing that you were right to be critical. The planets suggest it’s time to move on. ,pisces,What happens over the next 24 hours will finally convince you that a project you once had high hopes for is going nowhere and needs to be looked at again. Yes, it can be salvaged but is it worth the time and effort? Only you can decide. ,pisces,If what you are contemplating doing this weekend has in some way been done by other people before you then you must learn from their successes and failures. Why start from point zero when you don’t have to? Later on, others will learn from you.
pisces,What happens over the next two or three days will remind you that you should never take anything for granted. One way or the other change always happens, usually when we least expect it, so stay alert and be ready to act at a moment’s notice. ,pisces,You may not know why you mistrust a certain person but your instincts are rarely wrong, so by all means keep your distance. Mind planet Mercury will clarify things later in the week but for now it’s okay to be a bit suspicious.
pisces,It will become apparent over the next 24 hours that someone is taking advantage of your generous nature. Don’t make a big scene of it but let them know that if they want to stay in your good books they might like to desist – like now! ,pisces,There are certain issues you have been avoiding, but you can no longer pretend they do not exist. Fortunately, the Sun’s change of signs will give you the confidence you need to confront them – and you may be surprised how easily they are resolved. ,pisces,You will be in an adventurous mood today and that’s good because the planets suggest that if you go some place you have never visited before you will meet someone who lights up your life. This is also an excellent day to plan your next vacation. ,pisces,You may want to believe that if you ignore a problem it will go away of its own accord but that isn’t going to happen. Whatever the issue is you must face up to it over the next 48 hours – if you don’t it may actually get worse. ,pisces,There is no point living in dread of things that have not yet happened and most likely never will. Starting today, begin afresh with each new sunrise and believe that all things are possible. Your cosmic outlook is actually not just good but amazing.
pisces,Friends, family, work colleagues and employers – in fact just about everyone, will look favorably on you today. What have you done to deserve so much positive attention? Frankly, who knows and who cares! Make the most if it while you can.
pisces,You need to rethink something of a creative nature. Maybe you expected too much of yourself, or maybe you expected too much of other people, but either way you are going to have to make changes. Make them changes that primarily enrich you.
pisces,The world seems a sunnier and happier place now and long may it stay that way. By all means enjoy the feeling but be realistic too. There are still some shadows and dark places that will need to be braved over the next few days. ,pisces,You must not let vague fears and forebodings hold you back from doing what you want to be doing. Most likely they are the usual fictions and fantasies you encourage your mind to indulge in, so ignore them and do something bold.
pisces,Pisces is a sensitive sign and you will find it difficult to hide that side of your nature over the next 48 hours. But why would you want to hide it? You should never be scared of your emotions, not least because they make you unique.
pisces,You need to get your financial house in order and you need to do so quickly. According to the planets you have been living beyond your means for quite some time and you must find ways to cut back on your extravagance. That means now!,pisces,If you let your mind slip into negative ways of thinking you will find it hard to snap yourself out of it, at least until the Sun moves in your favor again towards the end of the month. Remember, as you think so you are – so think happy!,pisces,The more you try to get started on something new the more invisible forces seem to hold you back. Maybe you should take the hint and accept that you are not meant to go down that particular path, at least not yet. Bide your time.
pisces,You may have to make a few threats to get what you need today but it won’t be too difficult. On the other hand, your tough guy act will only work on those who are impressed by that sort of thing, so choose your targets wisely.
pisces,No matter how much Lady Luck has helped you of late you must not take your good fortune for granted. Your social and professional standing could come under a bit of pressure today, so keep your excesses at a reasonable level! ,pisces,Today’s Sun-Pluto link warns you must be cautious where money matters are concerned. Before each and every move you must ask yourself if the risks are worth the potential profits – and losses. If not, back off and stick with what you’ve got. ,pisces,There are a lot of exciting things going on in your world at the moment and most of them are hugely enjoyable. But don’t fall into the trap of thinking that nothing can go wrong – because that’s asking for trouble. Keep your wits about you.
pisces,The planets urge you to stop trying to micromanage every aspect of your life – and other people’s lives as well. Let go and let fate take its course and before you know it you will be flying along. You have nothing to fear from the future. ,pisces,Once again you are worrying about something you have no way of changing, but according to the planets what you fear the most is the one thing that is least likely to happen. Summon up your courage and don’t let silly anxieties hold you back.
pisces,There is a real possibility that you will come into money over the next few days, but there is also a possibility that you will lose money by signing up to a get-rich-quick scheme of some kind. If so, you will have only yourself to blame. ,pisces,Something that sounds like bad news early in the day will sound like good news come the evening, so don’t get dismayed if someone greets you with gloomy tidings. Changes on the home front won’t be as far-reaching as you fear. ,pisces,You seem to be quite aggressive in your opinions of late and some people are a bit concerned about it. They shouldn’t be. You have every right to stand up for what you believe, so long as you don’t take it too far and make it a war. ,pisces,You must get your financial affairs in order over the next few days. If you need to cut costs then do so and don’t listen to those who say you are overreacting. The sooner you get the books balanced the sooner your outlook will improve. ,pisces,You will need to keep your wits about you this weekend because the planets warn you will be a plaything for those who know how to push your emotional buttons. The more they say you must do one thing the more you must insist on doing the opposite!,pisces,According to the planets you are in one of your wasteful moods, so watch what you spend. Yes, of course, you can still go out and have a good time but you don’t have to treat everyone you meet. Let someone else get the check for a change.
pisces,You need to be more skeptical, especially when dealing with people who act as if they know all the answers. It’s more likely they have just a little bit of knowledge but come across as being well informed. In other words, they’re all talk!,pisces,You seem to believe that you need to be bigger and better than everyone else. Deep down you know that’s not possible, so let it go and just be who you are. The meaning of life is to be found not in competition but in love.
pisces,Stop taking life so seriously. No, really! According to the planets you have let certain things get to you in recent weeks and now you don’t know if you are coming or going. Focus on the fun things – there are still plenty of them in the world.
pisces,Something that has been hidden from you in recent weeks will be revealed either today or over the weekend, and something that made no sense will come into focus. For best results, rise above the petty stuff. Strive to see the big picture.
pisces,There will be a change in your mood over the next 48 hours. Where before you were oh so serious you will now be amazingly light-hearted. There will still, of course, be important issues to deal with but now you’ll face challenges with a smile. ,pisces,The Sun in the sympathetic sign of Scorpio will encourage you to take the kind of risks you usually try to avoid. This is the ideal time to expand your horizons and look further afield for friendship, love and success. The world is your plaything.
pisces,If you need a break then take it. You may worry that people in positions of authority won’t be happy with you taking time off but in fact they will be delighted. They can tell you were getting a bit jaded and want to see you fresh again.
pisces,It may be true that not everything has gone well for you of late but that is no reason to be gloomy. Life moves in cycles and it won’t be long before you are on the upside of the curve again. Always look forward, never look back.
pisces,It would appear that your fears have got the better of you and that’s not good. There is, of course, no logical reason why you should be afraid but on this occasion you may have no choice but to keep a low profile. You’ll bounce back later on. ,pisces,You may be a dreamer by nature but that must not be allowed to stop you being decisive where details are concerned. There is an art to seeing the bigger picture while not losing sight of what is taking place right in front of you. ,pisces,Your confidence is high at the moment and you seem more relaxed about your social status than you were a few days ago. One door may have closed to you but another door will open very soon. Will you have the courage to walk through it? ,pisces,You have some amazing ideas zapping round that busy brain of yours but what on earth are you going to do with them? Don’t get carried away by dreams that have little chance of coming true. You need common sense as well as imagination.
pisces,You don’t have to ask for anyone’s blessing before you make your escape. The world is crowding in on you to such an extent that you really have no choice but to get away for a bit. Leave petty, everyday things, and people, behind for a while. ,pisces,Before you commit to a project that will take up a lot of your time and energy step back a bit and make sure it is what you really want to do. If possible, give it a few more days before putting pen to paper. Refuse to be rushed.
pisces,There is no such thing as a free lunch and you will need to remind yourself of that fact today. Whatever it is that you are being offered you must find out what the true cost is likely to be – then and only then can you make an informed choice.
pisces,If you want to move up in the world you will have to confide more in people whose position and influence can make it happen for you. Yes, of course, you will have to give something in return, but nothing worth having comes for free.
pisces,Friends and colleagues may respect your motives but it would appear they are having a few doubts about your methods. Is there a better way to get your views and opinions across? Or do you just enjoy going around making enemies? ,pisces,You may not be in the most outgoing of moods at the moment but that’s okay. Your main aim now must be to build up your energy again so you are ready for the new week that begins on Monday – it’s going to be an extremely busy one. ,pisces,You possess a kind of insight that others find extremely spooky. But there will be nothing mystic or supernatural about the conclusions you reach this weekend. The evidence is there for everyone to see, though as usual most people won’t be looking.
pisces,Let your imagination guide you and don’t be afraid to follow your thoughts down what seem to be dark and dangerous paths. Most likely they are nothing of the sort and once you overcome your fear you will realize your full creative potential.
pisces,No matter how difficult the past few weeks have been what happens this week will more than make up for it. Get rid of any lingering negative thoughts and start looking forward to all the good things that are now hurtling your way.
pisces,If you confront what you are scared of today it won’t ever scare you again. Few things in life are worth getting worked up about, so face up to your fears and see them for what they are: illusions that can and must be ignored.
pisces,There is a danger that some strange ideas will muscle their way into your mind today and if you let them take hold they could cause serious problems. Keep telling yourself that your fears and anxieties mean nothing and can be safely ignored. ,pisces,No, the world is not ganging up on you, no matter how much it may look that way at times. Pisces is a sensitive sign by nature but sometimes you go too far and fear things that are completely unreal. Your worries are all in your mind.
pisces,The approaching full moon warns you not to pick fights over the next few days, not even with people you think you can beat. If you feel aggressive you should find ways to channel it into creative rather than potentially destructive activities.

pisces,Social activities will take up a lot of your time this week and that’s as it should be. The more others say that you are neglecting your duties the more you should go out of your way to have fun. Don’t let them spoil your mood. ,pisces,You may have plenty of big ideas but if you are wise you will wait until the effects of the current full moon have passed before going public with them. Chances are the world is not quite ready for them yet – but it soon will be.

pisces,Your confidence is sky-high at the moment but there is a danger that because things are going so well for you now that you will expect them to go well indefinitely. Sadly that is unlikely to happen, so live in and for the moment today.
pisces,Listen carefully to what others are saying because you might pick up something you can use to your benefit. Some people cannot help but brag about who and what they know and that’s exactly the kind of information that can be made to work for you.
pisces,Give others the benefit of the doubt this weekend, even if you suspect that they are misleading you. Neptune, your ruler, is moving in your favor again, so whatever happens you will be protected. Let others worry about the morality of their actions.

Practise saying “sorry” in front of a mirror. ,pisces,There is a lot of anticipation in the air at the moment and if you are smart you can use it to further your own ends. If nothing else others will be too busy with their own affairs to cast a critical eye over what you are doing.
pisces,There will be a serious clash of viewpoints on the domestic front over the next 24 hours. If you are smart you will simply refuse to get drawn into any kind of argument. If you are not so smart, the fallout could be spectacular.
pisces,You seem to believe that someone has got it in for you but is there any real evidence to back up your fears? Probably not. Play it safe by all means but don’t spend all your time looking over your shoulder for an enemy who does not exist.
pisces,You may not like it when things change without warning but you won’t have much say in the matter over the next 24 hours. Not all change is bad though, so maybe you should embrace what is happening – who knows, it might do you good.
